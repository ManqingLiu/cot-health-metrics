I need to figure out which date that is. Hmm, first, I should check what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the days would go like this: May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday would be the 4th. But wait, maybe I should double-check because sometimes my memory can be off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the calendar for May 2022. I know that May has 31 days. If I can find the first Wednesday, that's the answer. Let me try to recall or calculate the days. Let's start from May 1, 2022. If May 1 is a Sunday, then adding days:\n\n- May 1: Sunday\n- May 2: Monday\n- May 3: Tuesday\n- May 4: Wednesday\n\nSo that would make the first Wednesday on the 4th. But wait, maybe I should check another way. For example, if I know that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday, then the first Wednesday is three days later, which is the 4th. That seems right. Alternatively, if I'm not sure about May 1, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that May 6, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if May 4 is Wednesday, then May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday. That matches. So that seems correct. Therefore, the first Wednesday in May 2022 is the 4th. So the answer should be 4. But wait, the question says \"the first Wednesday of May 2022\". Let me make sure that there isn't a mistake here. If May 1 is Sunday, then the first Wednesday is indeed the 4th. So the answer is 4.", "4"], [49, "Between Tuesday, November 8, 2022 and Friday, December 16, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Answer with a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, November 8, 2022, and Friday, December 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. November 8, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. So November 8 would be 7 days later, which is also a Tuesday. So November 8 is a Tuesday. Then December 16 is a Friday. Let me check that. December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. So December 1 is Thursday, 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday, 5 is Monday, 6 is Tuesday, 7 is Wednesday, 8 is Thursday, 9 is Friday, 10 is Saturday, 11 is Sunday, 12 is Monday, 13 is Tuesday, 14 is Wednesday, 15 is Thursday, 16 is Friday. Yes, December 16 is a Friday. So the period starts on a Tuesday and ends on a Friday.\n\nNow, I need to count all the days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive, then subtract the weekends. Let's calculate the total days first.\n\nFirst, find the number of days between November 8 and December 16. Let's break it down:\n\nNovember has 30 days. So from November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 = 22 days. But since we include both start and end dates, it's 22 + 1 = 23 days in November? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on the 8th, then the number of days from the 8th to the 30th inclusive is 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. So total days is 23 + 16 = 39 days. Wait, but let me check again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nFrom November 8 to November 30: November 8 is day 1, November 9 is day 2, ..., November 30 is day 23. Then December 1 is day 24, December 2 is 25, ..., December 16 is day 24 + 15 = 39. So total days is 39. So 39 days in total.\n\nNow, out of these 39 days, how many are weekends? Let's count the weekends. The period starts on Tuesday, November 8. So the first week: November 8 (Tuesday), 9 (Wednesday), 10 (Thursday), 11 (Friday), 12 (Saturday), 13 (Sunday). So in this first week, the weekends are Saturday (12th) and Sunday (13th). Then the next week starts on November 14 (Monday). So each week has two weekend days. Let's see how many full weeks there are and then the remaining days.\n\nTotal days: 39. Let's divide by 7. 39 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 4 days. So 5 weeks is 35 days, and 4 days remaining. So the first 35 days consist of 5 weeks, each with 2 weekend days, so 5*2=10 weekend days. Then the remaining 4 days are November 30 (Friday), December 1 (Saturday), December 2 (Sunday), December 3 (Monday). Wait, wait. Wait, the remaining 4 days after 35 days would be day 36: November 30 (Friday), day 37: December 1 (Saturday), day 38: December 2 (Sunday), day 39: December 3 (Monday). Wait, but the total days are 39. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if the total days are 39, then 39 divided by 7 is 5 weeks (35 days) and 4 days remaining. So the first 35 days would be 5 weeks, and the remaining 4 days are the next four days. But the start date is November 8 (Tuesday). Let me check the dates again. Let me list the dates:\n\nWeek 1: Nov 8 (Tue) to Nov 14 (Mon) \u2013 7 days. Wait, no. Wait, November 8 is Tuesday. Then the next week would be November 15 (Tuesday) to November 21 (Monday). Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of weeks. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of weekends in the period.\n\nAlternatively, since the start date is Tuesday, November 8, and the end date is Friday, December 16. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays between these dates.\n\nFirst, let's find the first Saturday after November 8. November 8 is Tuesday. The next Saturday is November 12 (since 8+4=12). Then the next Saturday is November 19, 26, December 3, 10, 17. Wait, but December 16 is the end date. So let's list all the Saturdays and Sundays in the period.\n\nSaturdays: November 12, 19, 26; December 3, 10. Then December 17 is a Saturday, but that's after December 16, so not included. So that's 5 Saturdays.\n\nSundays: November 13, 20, 27; December 4, 11. December 18 is a Sunday, but that's after December 16. So that's 5 Sundays.\n\nSo total weekends are 5 + 5 = 10 days. Therefore, the total business days would be total days (39) minus 10 weekends, which is 29.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the weekends again. Let's list all the dates:\n\nFrom November 8 (Tue) to December 16 (Fri). Let's list each week:\n\nWeek 1: Nov 8 (Tue) to Nov 14 (Mon). Weekends here are Nov 12 (Sat) and Nov 13 (Sun). So 2 days.\n\nWeek 2: Nov 15 (Tue) to Nov 21 (Mon). Weekends: Nov 19 (Sat), Nov 20 (Sun). 2 days.\n\nWeek 3: Nov 22 (Tue) to Nov 28 (Mon). Weekends: Nov 26 (Sat), Nov 27 (Sun). 2 days.\n\nWeek 4: Nov 29 (Tue) to Dec 5 (Mon). Weekends: Dec 1 (Sat), Dec 2 (Sun). 2 days.\n\nWeek 5: Dec 6 (Tue) to Dec 12 (Mon). Weekends: Dec 8 (Sat), Dec 9 (Sun). 2 days.\n\nWeek 6: Dec 13 (Tue) to Dec 19 (Mon). Weekends: Dec 16 (Sat) is not in this week? Wait, Dec 13 is Tuesday, so Dec 16 is Friday. Wait, Dec 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri). So no weekends in this week. Wait, but the end date is Dec 16, which is Friday. So the last week is Dec 13 to Dec 16. So that week has no weekends. So that's 0 days.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. Let me check again. Let's list all the Saturdays and Sundays in the period.\n\nSaturdays:\n\n- Nov 12 (Week 1)\n- Nov 19 (Week 2)\n- Nov 26 (Week 3)\n- Dec 3 (Week 4)\n- Dec 10 (Week 5)\n- Dec 17 (Week 6) \u2013 but Dec 17 is after Dec 16, so not included.\n\nSo that's 5 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\n- Nov 13 (Week 1)\n- Nov 20 (Week 2)\n- Nov 27 (Week 3)\n- Dec 4 (Week 4)\n- Dec 11 (Week 5)\n- Dec 18 (Week 6) \u2013 after Dec 16, so not included.\n\nSo that's 5 Sundays.\n\nTotal weekends: 5 + 5 = 10 days. So total business days would be 39 - 10 = 29. But wait, let me check the total days again. If there are 5 weeks (35 days) and 4 days left, but the 4 days are Nov 30 (Fri), Dec 1 (Sat), Dec 2 (Sun), Dec 3 (Mon). Wait, that's 4 days. But according to the previous breakdown, the weekends are 10 days. So 39 total days minus 10 weekends is 29 business days. But let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays in the period.\n\nStarting from Nov 8 (Tuesday). Let's count each day:\n\nWeek 1: Nov 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon). So in this week, the business days are Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon. That's 5 days.\n\nWeek 2: Nov 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon). Business days: Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon. 5 days.\n\nWeek 3: Nov 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon). Business days: 5 days.\n\nWeek 4: Nov 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), Dec 1 (Thu), Dec 2 (Fri), Dec 3 (Sat), Dec 4 (Sun), Dec 5 (Mon). Business days: Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon. 5 days.\n\nWeek 5: Dec 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 12 (Mon). Business days: Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon. 5 days.\n\nWeek 6: Dec 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri). That's 4 days, all business days (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri).\n\nSo total business days: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 29. Yes, that matches. So the answer is 29.", "29"], [49, "Tell me whether 1940 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1940 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1940 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1940 divided by 4. 4 times 485 is 1940, right? So 4 x 485 = 1940. That means 1940 is divisible by 4. So that's the first condition satisfied.\n\nNext, I need to check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. So 1940 divided by 100 is 19.4. Wait, that's not a whole number. So 1940 is not a century year. Therefore, the second condition about being divisible by 400 doesn't apply here because it's not a century year.\n\nSince 1940 is divisible by 4 and not a century year, it should be a leap year. Let me just confirm that I didn't mix up any rules. The rule is: if divisible by 400, it's a leap year. If divisible by 100 but not by 400, it's not. If divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is. So 1940 is divisible by 4 and not by 100, so yes, it's a leap year.", "Yes"], [49, "Determine the day of the month for the second Tuesday in November 2022. Give the count numerically.

Hmm, first, I should check what day November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Tuesday would be the 1st. Then the second Tuesday would be the 8th. But wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me think. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then adding 7 days would make the next Tuesday the 8th. So the second Tuesday would be the 8th. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the count. Let me count again. The first Tuesday is the 1st, the second would be the 8th. So the answer should be 8. But I need to make sure that November 2022 actually has at least two Tuesdays. Since November has 30 days, and if the first Tuesday is the 1st, then the second is the 8th, third is 15th, fourth is 22nd, fifth is 29th. So yes, there are five Tuesdays.

Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that January 1st fell on a Saturday, and I need to find out what day of the week January 10th is. Alright, so first, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 10th. Well, from the 1st to the 10th is 9 days later, right? Because if you count from the 1st to the 2nd is one day, so adding 9 days to the 1st would get you to the 10th.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Saturday, I need to count 9 days forward. But wait, days of the week cycle every 7 days. So maybe I can divide 9 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 9 divided by 7 is 1 week with a remainder of 2 days. So that means 9 days later is the same as 1 week (which brings us back to Saturday) plus 2 more days.\n\nStarting from Saturday, adding one day would be Sunday, then adding another day would be Monday. So January 10th should be a Monday. Let me double-check that. If January 1 is Saturday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\nJanuary 2: Sunday\nJanuary 3: Monday\nJanuary 4: Tuesday\nJanuary 5: Wednesday\nJanuary 6: Thursday\nJanuary 7: Friday\nJanuary 8: Saturday\nJanuary 9: Sunday\nJanuary 10: Monday\n\nYes, that seems right.

Hmm, first, I should figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 51 days because weeks are 7 days, so dividing 51 by 7 will give me the number of weeks and the remainder will tell me how many days beyond the weeks.\n\nSo 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks with a remainder of 2 days. Because 7 times 7 is 49, and 51 minus 49 is 2. So that means 51 days later is 7 weeks and 2 days after the starting date. Since 7 weeks is exactly a week, the weekday will be the same as the starting day, which is Friday. Then adding 2 days to Friday. Friday plus one day is Saturday, plus another day is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's start from November 11, 2022, which is a Friday. Adding 7 days would be November 18, also a Friday. Then adding another 7 days, November 25, Friday again. Then December 2, 2022, Friday. Then December 9, Friday. Then December 16, Friday. Wait, that's 7 weeks, so 49 days. Then adding 2 more days: December 17 is Saturday, December 18 is Sunday. So that's 51 days later.

So I need to figure out what day of the week March 14th falls on.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 14th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I'll assume it's a common year with 28 days. Then March 1st is 28 days after February 28th, so March 14th would be 13 days after March 1st. Wait, no. Wait, let me count again.\n\nWait, January 1st is Sunday. So January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So to find March 14th, I need to count the number of days from January 1st to March 14th, then find the weekday by adding that number of days to Sunday.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days to January 31st gets us to February 28th. Then March 1st is 28 days after January 31st. Then March 14th is 13 days after March 1st. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 30 (January) + 28 (February) + 13 (March) = 71 days. Wait, no. Wait, January 1st is day 0. So January 1st is day 0, January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31, and February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59. March 14th is day 59 + 13 = day 72. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 72 days. Wait, but that's if we count January 1st as day 0. So the number of days between January 1st and March 14th is 72 days. But since January 1st is Sunday, adding 72 days to Sunday will give the weekday of March 14th.\n\nNow, to find the weekday, we can calculate 72 modulo 7, because the days of the week repeat every 7 days. 72 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 2 days. So 72 mod 7 is 2. So adding 2 days to Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 days is Tuesday. So March 14th would be a Tuesday?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days gets us to February 28th. Then March 1st is 28 days after January 31st. So March 14th is 13 days after March 1st. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 13 (Mar) = 71 days. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is day 0, so January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31, and February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59. March 14th is day 59 + 13 = day 72. So that's 72 days. So 72 days after January 1st (Sunday). So 72 divided by 7 is 10*7=70, remainder 2. So 72 days is 10 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. So March 14th is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Sunday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Sunday. Then January 8th is Sunday again (7 days later). January 15th is Sunday, January 22nd, January 29th. Then February 5th is Sunday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. March 5th is Sunday. Then March 12th is Sunday. So March 12th is Sunday. Then March 13th is Monday, March 14th is Tuesday.

So the last Thursday is the 30th. But if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 30 would be 29 days later. 29 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Wednesday would be Thursday.

But wait, if May 29 is Sunday, then May 26 is Thursday. So that's correct. So the last Thursday in May 2022 is May 26. Therefore, the answer should be 26. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for May 1. Let me check again. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. If I recall correctly, May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, 3 Tuesday, 4 Wednesday, 5 Thursday. So the first Thursday is May 5. Then each week after that. So the Thursdays would be 5, 12, 19, 26. Then the next one would be June 2. So May has four Thursdays: 5, 12, 19, 26. Therefore, the last one is the 26th. So the answer is 26. Therefore, the event would be on the 26th. So the answer is 26.", "26"], [49, "Is 2098 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2098 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2098. First, divide 2098 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 524 is 2096, so 2098 minus 2096 is 2. That means 2098 divided by 4 is 524.5, which is not a whole number. So 2098 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the rules, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me add 2098 + 2 = 2100. Wait, no, that's not necessary. The key point is that since 2098 isn't divisible by 4, it's automatically not a leap year. Even though 2100 is a century year and not divisible by 400, but that's a different year. So yeah, 2098 isn't divisible by 4, so it's not a leap year.", "No."], [49, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, February 6 to Friday, March 4, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates.\n\nStarting on February 6, 2022. Let me confirm what day that was. Wait, the question says it's a Sunday. So February 6 is a Sunday. Then the next day, February 7 is a Monday. So the first day is Sunday, which is a weekend. The end date is March 4, which is a Friday. So that's a weekday.\n\nSo the period starts on a Sunday and ends on a Friday. Let me figure out how many days are in between.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total days from February 6 to March 4 inclusive. Let's break it down.\n\nFebruary 2022: February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. So from February 6 to February 28 inclusive. Let's calculate that. February 6 to February 28 is 28 - 6 + 1 = 23 days. Wait, 28 minus 6 is 22, plus 1 is 23 days. But wait, if February 6 is the first day, then February 7 is the next day, so from February 6 to February 28 is 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total days would be 23 + 4 = 27 days. Wait, but that's if the start date is included and the end date is included. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if I have February 6 (Sunday) to February 28 (which is a Tuesday, because February 6 is Sunday, then February 7 is Monday, 8 Tuesday, 9 Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday, 13 Sunday, etc. Wait, maybe I should check the actual days. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or calculate the number of days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that from February 6 to March 4 is 27 days. Let me check that. Let's count the days:\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from February 6 to February 28 is 28 - 6 = 22 days, but since both start and end are included, it's 22 + 1 = 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total is 23 + 4 = 27 days.

So the weekends in this period are:\n\nSunday (Feb 6), Saturday (Feb 12), Sunday (Feb 13), Saturday (Feb 19), Sunday (Feb 20), Saturday (Feb 26), Sunday (Feb 27). Wait, that's 7 weekends. Wait, but day 22 is Sunday (Feb 27), and then day 23 is Monday (Feb 28). So that's correct. So there are 7 weekend days in total.\n\nSo total days is 27. Subtract 7 weekend days, so 27 - 7 = 20 weekdays. Wait, but let me check again. Because the first day is Sunday (weekend), and the last day is Friday (weekday). So the count of weekdays would be 27 total days minus 7 weekend days equals 20 weekdays.

I need to find out how many Mondays there are between Sunday, June 12, 2022, and Thursday, July 28, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those days are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates or find the first and last day of the period and count the Mondays from there. Let me start by checking what day of the week June 12, 2022, was. The problem says it's a Sunday. So June 12 is a Sunday. Then the next day, June 13, would be a Monday. So the first Monday in the period is June 13, 2022.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many Mondays are there until July 28, 2022. Let me figure out the total number of days between June 12 and July 28, inclusive. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, June has 30 days. So from June 12 to June 30, that's 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to calculate it differently. Wait, the period is from June 12 (Sunday) to July 28 (Thursday). Let me count the days step by step.\n\nJune 12 is day 1 (Sunday). Then June 13 is Monday. Let's count how many days are in June after June 12. June has 30 days, so from June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since June 12 is included, the total days in June would be 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have a period from day X to day Y inclusive, the number of days is Y - X + 1. So June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then July has 31 days, but we only go up to July 28. So July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total days from June 12 to July 28 is 19 (June) + 28 (July) = 47 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, June 12 to June 30 is 19 days. Then July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total is 19 + 28 = 47 days. So the total number of days in the period is 47.\n\nNow, since the first day is a Sunday (June 12), and the last day is Thursday (July 28). So the total days are 47. Now, to find the number of Mondays, we can divide the total days by 7 and see how many full weeks there are, then check the remaining days.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to find the first Monday and then count how many weeks and extra days there are. Since June 13 is the first Monday. Let's see how many Mondays are there.\n\nIf the first Monday is June 13, then the next Mondays would be June 20, 27, July 4, 11, 18, 25. Then July 28 is a Thursday, so the next Monday after July 25 would be August 1, which is outside the period. So let's count them:\n\nJune 13 (1), June 20 (2), June 27 (3), July 4 (4), July 11 (5), July 18 (6), July 25 (7). That's 7 Mondays. Wait, but let me check if July 25 is within the period. The period ends on July 28, so July 25 is included. So that's 7 Mondays. But wait, let me check the total days again. If there are 47 days, then 47 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 5 days. So 6 weeks would have 6 Mondays, and then the remaining 5 days would include one more Monday. Wait, but that would be 7 Mondays. But let me check the actual dates again.\n\nJune 12 is Sunday. So June 13 is Monday. Then each week after that. Let's count the Mondays:\n\nJune 13 (1), June 20 (2), June 27 (3), July 4 (4), July 11 (5), July 18 (6), July 25 (7). That's 7 Mondays. So that's correct. So the answer should be 7. But wait, let me check if July 25 is indeed within the period. The period ends on July 28, so July 25 is included. So yes, that's 7 Mondays.

Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and remaining days. Let me check the dates. January 24 is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, January 24, 2022: I think that was a Monday. Let me check. Well, I can't look it up, but assuming the question is correct, it's given as Monday. So starting on Monday, January 24.\n\nNow, the end date is Tuesday, March 22. So I need to count all the days from Jan 24 to Mar 22, inclusive, and then subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe break it down into months. January has 31 days. So from Jan 24 to Jan 31, that's 8 days (including Jan 24). Then February has 28 days in 2022 (since 2022 is not a leap year). Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days.\n\nWait, but I need to check if the dates are correct. Let me calculate the total days step by step.\n\nFirst, January 24 to January 31: that's 31 - 24 + 1 = 8 days. Because inclusive. So 24th is day 1, 25th day 2, ..., 31st is day 8.\n\nThen February has 28 days. So that's 28 days.\n\nThen March 1 to March 22 is 22 days.\n\nTotal days: 8 + 28 + 22 = 58 days.\n\nNow, out of these 58 days, how many are weekends?\n\nBut since the start date is a Monday, January 24, let's see the days of the week for each month.\n\nJanuary 24 is Monday. Then January 25 is Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday.\n\nSo in January, from the 24th to the 31st, the days are:\n\n24 (Mon), 25 (Tue), 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri), 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon). So in January, there are 2 Saturdays (29th and 30th? Wait, no. Wait, 29th is Saturday, 30th is Sunday, 31st is Monday. So in January, from 24th to 31st, there are two weekend days: 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun). So that's 2 weekend days.\n\nThen February 2022: February 1 is a Tuesday (since January 31 is Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday). Let me check that. If January 31 is Monday, then February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday, and February 2 is Wednesday, and so on. So February has 28 days. Let's count the number of weekends in February.\n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. So the weekends in February would be the Saturdays and Sundays. Let's find the first Saturday in February. Since February 1 is Tuesday, the first Saturday is February 5 (Tuesday 1, Wednesday 2, Thursday 3, Friday 4, Saturday 5). Then Sundays are 6th. Then next Saturday is 12th, Sunday 13th, 19th, 20th, 26th, 27th. Wait, February has 28 days. So the last day is February 28, which is a Monday (since 28 days later from Tuesday, 1st. 28 days is 4 weeks, so same day of the week. So February 28 is a Monday. So the weekends in February are:\n\nSaturdays: 5, 12, 19, 26. That's four Saturdays.\n\nSundays: 6, 13, 20, 27. That's four Sundays.\n\nTotal of 8 weekend days in February.\n\nThen March 1 is a Tuesday (since February 28 is Monday, March 1 is Tuesday). March 2 is Wednesday, March 3 is Thursday, March 4 is Friday, March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday, March 7 is Monday, and so on. The end date is March 22, which is a Tuesday.\n\nSo in March, from March 1 to March 22, how many weekends?\n\nMarch 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend in March is March 5 (Saturday) and March 6 (Sunday). Then next weekend is March 12 (Saturday), 13 (Sunday), then March 19 (Saturday), 20 (Sunday), and March 26 (Saturday), but March 22 is the end date. So in March, the weekends would be:\n\nMarch 5, 6 (weekend 1), March 12, 13 (weekend 2), March 19, 20 (weekend 3). Then March 26 is beyond March 22. So in March, from March 1 to March 22, there are three weekends: 5-6, 12-13, 19-20. That's 6 days.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period: January (2) + February (8) + March (6) = 16 weekend days.\n\nTotal days from Jan 24 to Mar 22 inclusive is 58 days. So business days would be 58 - 16 = 42 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of business days by counting the number of Mondays to Fridays in each month.\n\nStarting with January 24 (Monday) to January 31 (Monday). So in January, from 24th to 31st, there are 8 days. The days are:\n\nMon (24), Tue (25), Wed (26), Thu (27), Fri (28), Sat (29), Sun (30), Mon (31). So the business days here are 24 (Mon), 25 (Tue), 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri), and 31 (Mon). That's 6 business days. Wait, because 29 and 30 are weekends. So 8 total days minus 2 weekends = 6 business days.\n\nThen February has 28 days. Since February 1 is Tuesday, the first day of the month. Let's count the number of business days in February. Since February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks. So each week has 5 business days. 4 weeks * 5 = 20 business days. So February has 20 business days.\n\nMarch 1 is Tuesday. March 22 is Tuesday. So March has 22 days. Let's count the business days. March 1 is Tuesday, March 2 is Wednesday, March 3 is Thursday, March 4 is Friday, March 5 is Saturday (weekend), March 6 is Sunday (weekend), March 7 is Monday, and so on. So from March 1 to March 22, how many business days?\n\nMarch 1 to March 22 is 22 days. Let's count the weekends in this period. The weekends are March 5-6, 12-13, 19-20. So that's 6 days. So business days would be 22 - 6 = 16 days.\n\nSo total business days: January (6) + February (20) + March (16) = 42 days. That matches the previous calculation.

I need to find out what day of the week it is 99 days after Monday, December 26, 2022. Hmm, first, I should figure out the date 99 days later. Then, determine the weekday.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than counting each day. Since the question is about the weekday, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Because weeks cycle every 7 days. So 99 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder will tell me how many days ahead or behind the original day.\n\nLet me calculate 99 divided by 7. 7 times 14 is 98, so 99 is 14 weeks and 1 day. So 99 days later is 14 weeks and 1 day. Since the original day is Monday, adding 1 day would make it Tuesday. Wait, but wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the date is correct. Let me verify. December 26, 2022 is a Monday. Let me count 99 days forward. But maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the date? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're starting in December, maybe the next year's dates are affected. But since 99 days is less than a year, maybe I can just add days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. So if I add 14 weeks to Monday, that's still Monday. Then add 1 day, so Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with actual dates. Let me try to count. Let's start from December 26, 2022 (Monday). Let's count 99 days.\n\nFirst, December has 31 days. So from December 26 to December 31 is 5 days (26th is day 0, 27th is +1, ..., 31st is +5). Then January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, etc.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to use a calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that here, I need to calculate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 99 days later is 14 weeks and 1 day. So if the original day is Monday, adding 1 day would be Tuesday. But maybe I should check if the 99 days is exactly 14 weeks and 1 day. Let me check 14*7=98, so 98 days is 14 weeks. Then 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. So yes, adding 1 day to Monday is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because sometimes when you add days, depending on the month lengths, the actual date might not be exactly 14 weeks later. But since 99 days is exactly 14 weeks and 1 day, regardless of the months, the weekday should be one day later. So if the original day is Monday, adding 1 day is Tuesday.

Then the next day is Friday (16th), Saturday (17th), Sunday (18th), Monday (19th), Tuesday (20th), Wednesday (21st), Thursday (22nd), and so on. So in September, starting from the 15th, the weekdays would be Thursday (15), Friday (16), Monday (19), Tuesday (20), Wednesday (21), Thursday (22), Friday (23), Monday (26), Tuesday (27), Wednesday (28), Thursday (29), Friday (30). Wait, let me count that again.\n\nWait, September 15 is Thursday. Then:\n\nWeek 1: 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri). Wait, that's 16 days. So from 15 to 30 inclusive. Let me list the weekdays:\n\nThursday (15), Friday (16), Monday (19), Tuesday (20), Wednesday (21), Thursday (22), Friday (23), Monday (26), Tuesday (27), Wednesday (28), Thursday (29), Friday (30). That's 12 weekdays in September. Wait, let me count again. From 15 to 30:\n\nDays in September: 16 days. Let's check how many weekends. The weekends would be Saturday and Sunday. Let's see:\n\n17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 30 is Friday. Wait, 24 is Saturday, 25 Sunday. So that's 3 weekends (17,18,24,25) which is 4 days. So total days 16, minus 4 weekends = 12 weekdays. So September has 12 weekdays.\n\nNow moving to October. October has 31 days. Let's check the dates. October 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, wait, let me check. Wait, September 15 is Thursday. September 16 is Friday. September 17 is Saturday. So October 1 is the next day after September 30. September 30 is a Friday. So October 1 is Saturday. So October starts on Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday, etc.\n\nSo in October, the first day is Saturday. So the weekdays in October would be Monday (3), Tuesday (4), Wednesday (5), Thursday (6), Friday (7), and so on. Let's count the number of weekdays in October. Since October has 31 days, and starts on Saturday. Let's see how many weeks there are. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, plus 3 days. So in 4 weeks, there are 4*5=20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days are Saturday (1st), Sunday (2nd), Monday (3rd). So the extra days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So the extra weekdays are Monday (3rd). So total weekdays in October would be 20 + 1 = 21? Wait, no. Wait, the first day is Saturday. So the first week of October has Saturday (1), Sunday (2), Monday (3). So the first week has 1 weekday (Monday). Then the next weeks: each week has 5 weekdays. So 4 weeks would be 4*5=20, plus the extra 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) which includes 1 weekday (Monday). So total 21 weekdays in October. Wait, but that seems correct. Let me check another way. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, etc. in October.\n\nAlternatively, since October 1 is Saturday, then October 3 is Monday. Then the next Mondays are 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. So that's 5 Mondays. Similarly, Tuesdays would be 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 4 Tuesdays. Wednesdays: 5, 12, 19, 26. 4 Wednesdays. Thursdays: 6, 13, 20, 27. 4 Thursdays. Fridays: 7, 14, 21, 28. 4 Fridays. So total weekdays: 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21. Yes, that's correct. So October has 21 weekdays.\n\nNow November. November 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me check. October 31 is a Monday (since October 31 is the last day of October, which is a Monday). So November 1 is Tuesday. November has 30 days. So November 1 is Tuesday, 2 is Wednesday, 3 is Thursday, 4 is Friday, 5 is Saturday, 6 is Sunday, 7 is Monday, etc. So the weekdays in November would be from Tuesday (1) to Friday (4), then Monday (7), Tuesday (8), etc. Let's count the number of weekdays in November. November has 30 days. Let's see how many weeks. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks is 20 weekdays. The remaining 2 days are Tuesday (1) and Wednesday (2). So that's 2 weekdays. So total weekdays in November would be 20 + 2 = 22? Wait, but wait. Wait, November 1 is Tuesday, so the first week has Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Saturday (5), Sunday (6). Then the next weeks. So the first week has 5 weekdays (Tuesday to Friday). Then each subsequent week has 5 weekdays. So 4 weeks would be 4*5=20, plus the remaining 2 days (Tuesday and Wednesday) which are weekdays. So total 22 weekdays. But wait, November has 30 days. Let me check again. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, etc. in November.\n\nNovember 1 is Tuesday. So Mondays would be 7, 14, 21, 28. That's 4 Mondays. Tuesdays: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Tuesdays. Wednesdays: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. 5 Wednesdays. Thursdays: 3, 10, 17, 24. 4 Thursdays. Fridays: 4, 11, 18, 25. 4 Fridays. So total weekdays: 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 22. Yes, that's correct. So November has 22 weekdays.\n\nNow, adding up the weekdays from each month: September (12) + October (21) + November (22) = 12 + 21 is 33, plus 22 is 55. Wait, but wait. Wait, the end date is November 26, 2022. So November only goes up to the 26th. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because November has 30 days, but the end date is November 26. So I need to check how many weekdays are in November up to the 26th.\n\nWait, earlier I calculated November's weekdays as 22, but that's for the entire month. However, the end date is November 26. So I need to adjust that. Let me recalculate November's weekdays up to the 26th.\n\nNovember 1 is Tuesday. Let's list the dates up to November 26. Let's check what day November 26 is. Since November 1 is Tuesday, adding 25 days (since 26-1=25). 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So 3 weeks later is Tuesday again, plus 4 days: Tuesday + 4 days is Saturday. So November 26 is a Saturday. Wait, but the end date is Saturday, November 26. So the end date is included. So in November, from November 1 (Tuesday) to November 26 (Saturday), how many weekdays are there?\n\nLet me list the dates:\n\nNovember 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat).\n\nNow, count the weekdays (Mon-Fri) from November 1 to November 26 inclusive.\n\nLet's go through each day:\n\n1 (Tue) - weekday\n2 (Wed) - weekday\n3 (Thu) - weekday\n4 (Fri) - weekday\n5 (Sat) - weekend\n6 (Sun) - weekend\n7 (Mon) - weekday\n8 (Tue) - weekday\n9 (Wed) - weekday\n10 (Thu) - weekday\n11 (Fri) - weekday\n12 (Sat) - weekend\n13 (Sun) - weekend\n14 (Mon) - weekday\n15 (Tue) - weekday\n16 (Wed) - weekday\n17 (Thu) - weekday\n18 (Fri) - weekday\n19 (Sat) - weekend\n20 (Sun) - weekend\n21 (Mon) - weekday\n22 (Tue) - weekday\n23 (Wed) - weekday\n24 (Thu) - weekday\n25 (Fri) - weekday\n26 (Sat) - weekend\n\nNow count the number of weekdays:\n\nFrom 1-4: 4 weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\nThen 7-11: 5 weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\nThen 14-18: 5 weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\nThen 21-25: 5 weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\nTotal: 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19 weekdays in November.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous calculation. So earlier I thought November had 22 weekdays in the entire month, but since we're only going up to the 26th, which is a Saturday, the number is 19. So that's a mistake in my previous calculation. So I need to adjust that.\n\nSo the correct number for November is 19 weekdays. Therefore, the total is September (12) + October (21) + November (19) = 12 + 21 is 33, plus 19 is 52. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, let me recount the November weekdays again. Let's list them:\n\n1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri) \u2192 4 days\n7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri) \u2192 5 days\n14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri) \u2192 5 days\n21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri) \u2192 5 days\nTotal: 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19. Yes, that's correct. So November contributes 19 weekdays.\n\nSo total is 12 (Sep) + 21 (Oct) + 19 (Nov) = 52. But wait, let me check if the start and end dates are included. The start date is September 15 (Thursday), which is included. The end date is November 26 (Saturday), which is included. So in the September count, we included September 15 (Thursday) and September 30 (Friday). In October, all 31 days are included. In November, up to the 26th. So the total is 12 + 21 + 19 = 52. But wait, let me check another way. Maybe using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, calculate the total number of days between September 15 and November 26 inclusive, then subtract the number of weekends.\n\nFirst, calculate the total days. Let's find the number of days from September 15 to November 26.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. From September 15 to September 30 is 16 days (30 - 15 + 1 = 16). October has 31 days. November has 26 days (since we're stopping at the 26th). So total days = 16 + 31 + 26 = 73 days. Wait, 16 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 26 (Nov) = 73 days total. Now, how many weekends are in these 73 days?\n\nWeekends are Saturday and Sunday. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in this period.\n\nStarting from September 15 (Thursday). Let's list the days:\n\nSeptember 15 is Thursday. Let's find the first Saturday after that. September 15 is Thursday, so the next Saturday is September 17. Then Sundays are 18. Then the next Saturday is 24, Sunday 25. Then 30 is Friday. Then October 1 is Saturday. Then October 2 is Sunday. Then October 3 is Monday. Then October 6 is Saturday, 7 Sunday. October 13 Saturday, 14 Sunday. October 20 Saturday, 21 Sunday. October 27 Saturday, 28 Sunday. November 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday. November 10 Saturday, 11 Sunday. November 17 Saturday, 18 Sunday. November 24 Saturday, 25 Sunday. November 26 is Saturday. Wait, but the end date is November 26, which is Saturday. So let's count all the Saturdays and Sundays between September 15 and November 26 inclusive.\n\nLet me list all the Saturdays and Sundays in this period.\n\nFirst, September:\n\nSaturdays: 17, 24 (since 17 is the first Saturday after 15, then 24 is the next, then 31 is the next but that's beyond September 30). So two Saturdays in September.\n\nSundays: 18, 25. Two Sundays.\n\nOctober:\n\nSaturdays: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Five Saturdays.\n\nSundays: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Five Sundays.\n\nNovember:\n\nSaturdays: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. But November only goes up to the 26th. So Saturdays in November are 3, 10, 17, 24. Four Saturdays.\n\nSundays: 4, 11, 18, 25. Four Sundays.\n\nSo total Saturdays: 2 (Sep) + 5 (Oct) + 4 (Nov) = 11.\n\nTotal Sundays: 2 (Sep) + 5 (Oct) + 4 (Nov) = 11.\n\nTotal weekends: 11 + 11 = 22.\n\nSo total days is 73. Subtract 22 weekends: 73 - 22 = 51 weekdays. Wait, but earlier I calculated 52. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm. So according to this method, total days is 73, minus 22 weekends gives 51 weekdays. But earlier, when I counted per month, I had 12 + 21 + 19 = 52. So which is correct?\n\nLet me check the per-month count"], [49, "Is 2055 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2055 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2055. First, divide 2055 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2055 minus 2000 is 55. 55 divided by 4 is 13.75. So 2055 divided by 4 is 513.75. That means 2055 is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check again. Let me add 4 to 2055: 2055 + 4 is 2059. So 2055 is not a multiple of 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, since it's not divisible by 4, it can't be a leap year. \n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if it's a century year. Century years are those ending with 00, like 2000, 2100, etc. 2055 ends with 55, so it's not a century year. Therefore, even if it were divisible by 4, which it isn't, the second condition about century years wouldn't apply here. But since it's not divisible by 4 at all, the answer is no. \n\nSo the conclusion is that 2055 is not a leap year.", "No."], [49, "Count forward 46 days from Wednesday, February 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 46 days after Wednesday, February 2, 2022. Hmm, so first, I should figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 46 days because weeks repeat every 7 days. \n\nSo, 46 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 6 is 42, which leaves a remainder of 4. So 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days. Since 6 weeks later would be the same day of the week, adding 4 days to Wednesday should give me the answer.\n\nStarting from Wednesday, adding 1 day is Thursday, 2 days is Friday, 3 days is Saturday, and 4 days is Sunday. Wait, so that would make the 46th day a Sunday? Let me double-check. Maybe I should count each day step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or check the actual dates. But since I don't have a calendar here, I need to rely on calculations. Let me confirm the remainder again. 46 divided by 7 is 6 with a remainder of 4. So adding 4 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nWait, but sometimes when you count days, you have to be careful whether you include the starting day or not. For example, if you start on day 0 as Wednesday, then adding 1 day would be day 1, which is Thursday. So 46 days later would be day 46. Since 46 mod 7 is 4, that would be 4 days after Wednesday. So Sunday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by looking at the actual dates. Let's see, February 2, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let me count forward. \n\nFebruary has 28 days in 2022, right? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So February 2 is Wednesday. Adding 28 days would take me to March 1, 2022, which would also be a Wednesday. Then adding another 28 days would be March 29, 2022, which is another Wednesday. Wait, but 28 days is exactly 4 weeks. So that's correct. \n\nBut I need to go 46 days from February 2. So 28 days later is March 1 (Wednesday). Then another 28 days would be March 29 (Wednesday). But 28 + 28 is 56 days, which is more than 46. So maybe I should break it down differently. \n\nFrom February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since February 2 is day 0, then February 3 is day 1, so February 28 is day 26). Wait, no. Wait, if February 2 is day 0, then February 3 is day 1, and so on. So February 28 is 26 days later. Then adding 26 days to February 2 would be February 28. Then adding another 20 days (since 26 + 20 = 46) would take me to March 20, 2022. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me check again. \n\nWait, from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days. Then adding 20 days to that would be March 20. But 26 + 20 is 46. So March 20, 2022. Now, if February 28 is a Wednesday (since 28 days later is March 1, which is Wednesday), then February 28 is a Wednesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. So March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 8 is Wednesday, March 15, March 22, March 29. So March 22 is Wednesday. Then March 22 + 1 day is March 23 (Thursday), March 24 (Friday), March 25 (Saturday), March 26 (Sunday), March 27 (Monday), March 28 (Tuesday), March 29 (Wednesday). Wait, so March 22 is Wednesday. Then March 22 + 4 days is March 26, which would be Sunday. Wait, but that's 4 days after March 22. So if March 22 is Wednesday, then March 26 is Sunday. But March 22 is 26 days after February 2. So adding 20 days to March 22 would be March 22 + 20 days. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the initial method. 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday. But I need to make sure that the initial calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try another approach. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nStarting from February 2, 2022 (Wednesday):\n\nDay 0: Feb 2 (Wednesday)\nDay 1: Feb 3 (Thu)\nDay 2: Feb 4 (Fri)\nDay 3: Feb 5 (Sat)\nDay 4: Feb 6 (Sun)\nDay 5: Feb 7 (Mon)\nDay 6: Feb 8 (Tue)\nDay 7: Feb 9 (Wed)\n... and so on. Each week cycles every 7 days. So 46 days later would be 46 mod 7 = 4. So adding 4 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if the remainder is correct. 46 divided by 7 is 6*7=42, remainder 4. So yes, 4 days. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Sunday.", "Sunday"], [49, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Reply with the numerical value.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, December 4, 2022, to Saturday, January 14, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates. Wait, the start date is Sunday, December 4, 2022, and the end date is Saturday, January 14, 2022. Wait, but January 14 is after December 4, so the period is from December 4 to January 14. But I need to make sure that the dates are correct. Let me confirm the actual dates.\n\nWait, December 4, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me check that. Let me think: December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. So December 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday. Yes, that's correct. Then January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Wait, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I need to check that again. Wait, I think I might be mixing up the years. Let me think again. Let me check the actual calendar for 2022.\n\nWait, December 4, 2022 is a Sunday. Then January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Let me think: 2022 started on a Sunday? No, wait. Wait, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So December 31, 2021 was a Friday. Then December 31, 2022 would be a Friday? Wait, no. Wait, 2022 is a common year, so 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday plus 364 days (which is 52 weeks) plus one day. So December 31, 2022 would be a Sunday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just count the days between the two dates, considering weekends. But maybe it's easier to break it down into months and count the business days in each month.\n\nSo the period is from December 4, 2022 (Sunday) to January 14, 2022 (Saturday). Wait, but wait, January 14, 2022 is after December 4, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, December 4 is in December, and January 14 is in January. So the period is from December 4 to January 14, inclusive. But wait, the end date is January 14, 2022. Wait, but that's in the next year? Wait, no, the question says from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022. So that's from December 4, 2022 to January 14, 2022. Wait, but that's a period that spans into the next year? Wait, no, 2022 is the year. So December 4 to January 14 is within 2022. Wait, but January 14, 2022 is after December 4, 2022. So the period is from December 4 to January 14, 2022. So that's 1 month and 10 days? Wait, December has 31 days. So from December 4 to December 31 is 28 days (including December 4). Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total days would be 28 + 14 = 42 days. But I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should count the days between the two dates. Let me check the actual number of days between December 4, 2022 and January 14, 2022. Let's see. December has 31 days. So from December 4 to December 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total days is 27 + 14 = 41 days. But since the start date is inclusive, and the end date is inclusive, the total number of days is 41 + 1 = 42 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have two dates, the number of days between them inclusive is (end date - start date) + 1. So if December 4 is day 1, and January 14 is day 42, then the total days would be 42. But I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a date calculator. But since I can't do that here, I need to calculate manually. Let me think again. December 4 is the first day. Then December 5 is the next day, and so on. So from December 4 to December 31 is 28 days (since 31 - 4 = 27, plus 1 for inclusive). Wait, no. Wait, if you have from day 1 to day N inclusive, the number of days is N. So if December 4 is day 1, then December 5 is day 2, ..., December 31 is day 28. Then January 1 is day 29, January 2 is day 30, ..., January 14 is day 42. So total days is 42. So that's 42 days in total.\n\nNow, out of these 42 days, how many are business days (Monday-Friday)? So I need to count the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period and subtract them from 42.\n\nSo first, let's figure out the days of the week for each date. The start date is Sunday, December 4, 2022. Let's list the days:\n\nDecember 4: Sunday\n\nDecember 5: Monday\n\nDecember 6: Tuesday\n\nDecember 7: Wednesday\n\nDecember 8: Thursday\n\nDecember 9: Friday\n\nDecember 10: Saturday\n\nDecember 11: Sunday\n\nDecember 12: Monday\n\nDecember 13: Tuesday\n\nDecember 14: Wednesday\n\nDecember 15: Thursday\n\nDecember 16: Friday\n\nDecember 17: Saturday\n\nDecember 18: Sunday\n\nDecember 19: Monday\n\nDecember 20: Tuesday\n\nDecember 21: Wednesday\n\nDecember 22: Thursday\n\nDecember 23: Friday\n\nDecember 24: Saturday\n\nDecember 25: Sunday\n\nDecember 26: Monday\n\nDecember 27: Tuesday\n\nDecember 28: Wednesday\n\nDecember 29: Thursday\n\nDecember 30: Friday\n\nDecember 31: Saturday\n\nThen January 1: Sunday\n\nJanuary 2: Monday\n\nJanuary 3: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 4: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 5: Thursday\n\nJanuary 6: Friday\n\nJanuary 7: Saturday\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday\n\nJanuary 9: Monday\n\nJanuary 10: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 11: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 12: Thursday\n\nJanuary 13: Friday\n\nJanuary 14: Saturday\n\nSo now, let's count the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period.\n\nStarting from December 4 (Sunday) to January 14 (Saturday).\n\nFirst, let's list all the dates and their days of the week.\n\nDecember 4: Sunday (count as weekend)\n\nDecember 5: Monday\n\nDecember 6: Tuesday\n\nDecember 7: Wednesday\n\nDecember 8: Thursday\n\nDecember 9: Friday\n\nDecember 10: Saturday (weekend)\n\nDecember 11: Sunday (weekend)\n\nDecember 12: Monday\n\nDecember 13: Tuesday\n\nDecember 14: Wednesday\n\nDecember 15: Thursday\n\nDecember 16: Friday\n\nDecember 17: Saturday (weekend)\n\nDecember 18: Sunday (weekend)\n\nDecember 19: Monday\n\nDecember 20: Tuesday\n\nDecember 21: Wednesday\n\nDecember 22: Thursday\n\nDecember 23: Friday\n\nDecember 24: Saturday (weekend)\n\nDecember 25: Sunday (weekend)\n\nDecember 26: Monday\n\nDecember 27: Tuesday\n\nDecember 28: Wednesday\n\nDecember 29: Thursday\n\nDecember 30: Friday\n\nDecember 31: Saturday (weekend)\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday (weekend)\n\nJanuary 2: Monday\n\nJanuary 3: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 4: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 5: Thursday\n\nJanuary 6: Friday\n\nJanuary 7: Saturday (weekend)\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday (weekend)\n\nJanuary 9: Monday\n\nJanuary 10: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 11: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 12: Thursday\n\nJanuary 13: Friday\n\nJanuary 14: Saturday (weekend)\n\nNow, let's count the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this list.\n\nLooking at each date:\n\nDecember 4: Sunday (1)\n\nDecember 10: Saturday (2)\n\nDecember 11: Sunday (3)\n\nDecember 17: Saturday (4)\n\nDecember 18: Sunday (5)\n\nDecember 24: Saturday (6)\n\nDecember 25: Sunday (7)\n\nDecember 31: Saturday (8)\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday (9)\n\nJanuary 7: Saturday (10)\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday (11)\n\nJanuary 14: Saturday (12)\n\nSo that's 12 weekend days. Wait, let me count again to make sure.\n\nStarting from December 4 (Sunday) as 1.\n\nThen December 10 (Saturday) is 2.\n\nDecember 11 (Sunday) is 3.\n\nDecember 17 (Saturday) is 4.\n\nDecember 18 (Sunday) is 5.\n\nDecember 24 (Saturday) is 6.\n\nDecember 25 (Sunday) is 7.\n\nDecember 31 (Saturday) is 8.\n\nJanuary 1 (Sunday) is 9.\n\nJanuary 7 (Saturday) is 10.\n\nJanuary 8 (Sunday) is 11.\n\nJanuary 14 (Saturday) is 12.\n\nYes, that's 12 weekend days.\n\nSo total days is 42. Subtract 12 weekend days, so 42 - 12 = 30 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I missed some weekends or counted extra.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the business days directly.\n\nFrom December 4 (Sunday) to January 14 (Saturday). Let's list the business days.\n\nStarting with December 4: Sunday is a weekend, so not counted. The next business day is December 5 (Monday). Then December 6 (Tuesday), 7 (Wednesday), 8 (Thursday), 9 (Friday). Then December 10 is Saturday (weekend), so not counted. December 11 is Sunday (weekend). December 12 is Monday. So from December 5 to December 11, the business days are 5,6,7,8,9,12. Wait, that's 6 days. Wait, December 5 to December 9 is 5 days (Monday to Friday). Then December 12 is the next Monday. So that's 5 + 1 = 6 days.\n\nThen December 13 (Wednesday), 14 (Thursday), 15 (Friday), 16 (Saturday), 17 (Sunday). So business days are 13,14,15. That's 3 days.\n\nThen December 18 (Monday), 19 (Tuesday), 20 (Wednesday), 21 (Thursday), 22 (Friday). That's 5 days.\n\nDecember 23 (Saturday), 24 (Sunday). So business days are 23 is Saturday (weekend), 24 is Sunday (weekend). So no business days here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, December 23 is Saturday, 24 is Sunday. So the next business day is December 26 (Monday). So from December 26 to December 30: 26 (Monday), 27 (Tuesday), 28 (Wednesday), 29 (Thursday), 30 (Friday). That's 5 days.\n\nThen December 31 is Saturday (weekend). So no business day there.\n\nThen January 1 is Sunday (weekend), January 2 (Monday), 3 (Tuesday), 4 (Wednesday), 5 (Thursday), 6 (Friday). That's 5 days.\n\nJanuary 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday) are weekends. Then January 9 (Monday) to January 13 (Friday): 9,10,11,12,13. That's 5 days.\n\nJanuary 14 is Saturday (weekend), so not counted.\n\nSo adding up all the business days:\n\nFrom December 5-9: 5 days\n\nDecember 12-15: 3 days (12,13,14,15? Wait, December 12 is Monday, 13 is Tuesday, 14 is Wednesday, 15 is Thursday. So that's 4 days. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nWait, December 5 (Monday) to December 9 (Friday): 5 days.\n\nThen December 10 is Saturday (weekend), 11 is Sunday (weekend). December 12 is Monday. So from December 12 to December 15: 12 (Monday), 13 (Tuesday), 14 (Wednesday), 15 (Thursday). That's 4 days.\n\nThen December 16 is Friday. Wait, December 16 is Friday. Then December 17 is Saturday (weekend), 18 is Sunday (weekend). So the next business day is December 26 (Monday). So from December 26 to December 30: 26 (Monday), 27 (Tuesday), 28 (Wednesday), 29 (Thursday), 30 (Friday). That's 5 days.\n\nThen January 1 is Sunday (weekend), 2 (Monday), 3 (Tuesday), 4 (Wednesday), 5 (Thursday), 6 (Friday). That's 5 days.\n\nThen January 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday) are weekends. Then January 9 (Monday) to January 13 (Friday): 9,10,11,12,13. That's 5 days.\n\nSo total business days: 5 (Dec 5-9) + 4 (Dec 12-15) + 5 (Dec 26-30) + 5 (Jan 2-6) + 5 (Jan 9-13) = 5+4=9, 9+5=14, 14+5=19, 19+5=24. Wait, that's 24 business days. But earlier I had 30. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I missed some days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the total days from Dec 4 to Jan 14 is 42 days. If there are 12 weekend days, then 42-12=30 business days. But according to the direct count, I have 24. So there's a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed some business days in the direct count. Let me check again.\n\nLet me list all the business days step by step.\n\nStarting from December 4 (Sunday) to January 14 (Saturday).\n\nFirst, December 4 is Sunday (weekend). So the first business day is December 5 (Monday).\n\nThen:\n\nDec 5 (Mon)\n\nDec 6 (Tue)\n\nDec 7 (Wed)\n\nDec 8 (Thu)\n\nDec 9 (Fri)\n\nDec 10 (Sat) - weekend\n\nDec 11 (Sun) - weekend\n\nDec 12 (Mon)\n\nDec 13 (Tue)\n\nDec 14 (Wed)\n\nDec 15 (Thu)\n\nDec 16 (Fri)\n\nDec 17 (Sat) - weekend\n\nDec 18 (Sun) - weekend\n\nDec 19 (Mon)\n\nDec 20 (Tue)\n\nDec 21 (Wed)\n\nDec 22 (Thu)\n\nDec 23 (Fri)\n\nDec 24 (Sat) - weekend\n\nDec 25 (Sun) - weekend\n\nDec 26 (Mon)\n\nDec 27 (Tue)\n\nDec 28 (Wed)\n\nDec 29 (Thu)\n\nDec 30 (Fri)\n\nDec 31 (Sat) - weekend\n\nJan 1 (Sun) - weekend\n\nJan 2 (Mon)\n\nJan 3 (Tue)\n\nJan 4 (Wed)\n\nJan 5 (Thu)\n\nJan 6 (Fri)\n\nJan 7 (Sat) - weekend\n\nJan 8 (Sun) - weekend\n\nJan 9 (Mon)\n\nJan 10 (Tue)\n\nJan 11 (Wed)\n\nJan 12 (Thu)\n\nJan 13 (Fri)\n\nJan 14 (Sat) - weekend\n\nNow, let's count all the business days (Mon-Fri) in this list.\n\nStarting from Dec 5:\n\nDec 5,6,7,8,9 (5 days)\n\nDec 12,13,14,15,16 (5 days)\n\nDec 19,20,21,22,23 (5 days)\n\nDec 26,27,28,29,30 (5 days)\n\nJan 2,3,4,5,6 (5 days"], [49, "On which weekday did June 26, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 26, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use a known date that I know the weekday for. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 is a specific date. Let me try to count the days from a known date. Let's say I know that June 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, if I can find a reference point. Let me think. For example, if I know that June 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then adding 25 days would get me to June 26. Let me check how many days that is. 25 days later. Since each week has 7 days, 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So if June 1 is a Tuesday, then adding 3 weeks (21 days) would still be Tuesday, and then 4 more days would be Saturday. So June 26 would be a Saturday? Wait, but I need to confirm if June 1, 2022 was indeed a Tuesday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me think about the year 2022. I know that 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. Let me try to count from a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then January 8, 15, 22, and 29 were also Sundays. Then February 5, 12, 19, and 26 were Sundays. March 6, 13, 20, 27 were Sundays. April 3, 10, 17, 24, May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 were Sundays. Then June 5, 12, 19, 26 were Sundays. Wait, so June 5, 2022 was a Sunday. Therefore, June 5 is Sunday. Then June 6 is Monday, June 7 is Tuesday, June 8 is Wednesday, June 9 is Thursday, June 10 is Friday, June 11 is Saturday, June 12 is Sunday. Wait, so June 12 is Sunday. Then June 26 would be 14 days later. 14 days is exactly two weeks, so June 26 would also be a Sunday? But that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, if June 5 is Sunday, then adding 7 days is June 12, which is Sunday. Then adding another 7 days is June 19, Sunday. Then adding another 7 days is June 26, Sunday. So according to this, June 26, 2022 was a Sunday. But earlier I thought that June 1 was Tuesday. That must be wrong. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if June 5 is Sunday, then June 1 would be 4 days before that. So June 1 is Thursday. Because June 5 is Sunday. So June 1 is Thursday. Then June 2 is Friday, June 3 is Saturday, June 4 is Sunday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if June 5 is Sunday, then June 4 is Saturday, June 3 is Friday, June 2 is Thursday, June 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I messed up the days. Let me recount.\n\nIf June 5 is Sunday, then June 5 is Sunday. Then June 4 is Saturday, June 3 is Friday, June 2 is Thursday, June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. But earlier I thought that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that again. If January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then January 8, 15, 22, 29 were Sundays. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26 were Sundays. March 6, 13, 20, 27 were Sundays. April 3, 10, 17, 24, May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 were Sundays. Then June 5, 12, 19, 26 were Sundays. So that would mean June 5 is Sunday. Therefore, June 1 is 4 days before June 5. So June 1 is Wednesday. But if January 1 is Sunday, then how does that align?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual calendar. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check the number of days from January 1, 2022 to June 26, 2022. Let's calculate that. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March has 31, April 30, May 31, and June 26. So total days from January 1 to June 26 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 26 (June) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+31=151, 151+26=177 days. So 177 days from January 1, 2022. Now, if January 1 is a Sunday, then 177 days later is what day of the week?\n\nSince 7 days in a week, 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 2 days. So 25 weeks is 175 days, so 177 days is 25 weeks and 2 days. Therefore, January 1 is Sunday, so adding 2 days would be Tuesday. Therefore, June 26, 2022 would be a Tuesday? But that contradicts the previous calculation where June 5 was Sunday. Wait, there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recalculate the days from January 1 to June 26. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February is 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 26. So total days from January 1 to June 26 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 26. Let me add them again:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n\n151 + 26 (June) = 177. So that's correct. 177 days. So 177 divided by 7 is 25*7=175, remainder 2. So 2 days after Sunday is Tuesday. Therefore, June 26 would be Tuesday. But earlier, when I thought June 5 was Sunday, that would mean June 26 is Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that. I think I might have confused the year. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year. Let me check an actual calendar. Alternatively, I can use another method. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is Monday, then June 26 is 8 days before July 4. 8 days before July 4 is June 26. 8 days is 1 week and 1 day. So if July 4 is Monday, then June 26 is 1 day before Monday, which is Sunday. Wait, that would mean June 26 is Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, it's Tuesday. There's a contradiction here. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the July 4 date. Let me check. July 4, 2022. I think that was a Monday. Let me confirm. If I check an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my knowledge. Alternatively, I can use another approach. Let's take June 26, 2022. If I know that June 26 is Sunday, then July 4 is 8 days later, which would be Sunday + 8 days. 8 days is 1 week and 1 day, so Sunday + 1 day is Monday. That matches. So that would mean June 26 is Sunday. But according to the other calculation, it's Tuesday. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh, the mistake is in the assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that again. If June 26 is Sunday, then the number of days from January 1 to June 26 is 177 days. 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 2 days. So if June 26 is Sunday, then January 1 would be Sunday minus 2 days, which is Friday. So January 1, 2022 was a Friday. But I thought it was a Sunday. So that's where the error was. Therefore, my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday was wrong. So that's why there was a conflict.\n\nSo, if June 26 is Sunday, then January 1 is Friday. Let me check that. Let's count the days from January 1 (Friday) to June 26. 177 days. 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 2 days. So 25 weeks later is the same day, Friday. Adding 2 days would be Sunday. So that matches. Therefore, June 26 is Sunday. Therefore, the correct answer is Sunday.\n\nBut how do I know that July 4 is Monday? Let me check again. If June 26 is Sunday, then June 27 is Monday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 29 is Wednesday, June 30 is Thursday, July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. Yes, that's correct. So July 4 is Monday. Therefore, June 26 is Sunday. Therefore, the correct answer is Sunday.", "Sunday"], [49, "Name the day of the week for 06/29/2022. Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 29, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yes, that seems right. So if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then I can count the days from there to June 29, 2022.\n\nLet me break it down month by month. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later (since January 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days in 2022 because it's not a leap year. March has 31 days, April has 30, May has 31, and June has 30 days. Wait, but I need to get to June 29. So let's calculate the total number of days from January 1 to June 29.\n\nStarting with January: 31 days. But since January 1 is day 0, then January 1 is Sunday. So January 2 is Monday, etc. Wait, maybe I should calculate the total number of days from January 1 to June 29, then find the remainder when divided by 7 to determine the day of the week.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later (since January 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. March has 31, April 30, May 31, and then June 29. Wait, but I need to add up all the days from January 1 to June 29. Let me do that step by step.\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. But since we start counting from January 1 as day 0, then the number of days from January 1 to June 29 is:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (including January 1)\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 31 days\nJune: 29 days (since we need up to June 29)\n\nWait, but if I add all those together: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 29. Let me calculate that.\n\n31 + 28 is 59. 59 + 31 is 90. 90 + 30 is 120. 120 + 31 is 151. 151 + 29 is 180. So total days from January 1 to June 29 is 180 days. But wait, if January 1 is day 0, then June 29 is day 179? Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1 and June 29 is 179 days. Because from January 1 to June 29 is 180 days in total, but since we start counting from day 0, the difference is 179 days. So 179 days later.\n\nNow, since each week has 7 days, I can divide 179 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead from Sunday (January 1) the date is.\n\nLet me calculate 179 divided by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 179 - 175 is 4. So the remainder is 4. That means June 29 is 4 days after Sunday. Sunday + 1 is Monday, +2 is Tuesday, +3 is Wednesday, +4 is Thursday. So June 29, 2022 would be a Thursday?\n\nWait, but I need to check if my calculation of the total days is correct. Let me recount the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 29. So adding those:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n\n151 + 29 (June) = 180. So total days from January 1 to June 29 is 180 days. But if January 1 is day 0, then June 29 is day 179. So 179 days later. 179 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 4 days. So 4 days after Sunday is Thursday. So the answer should be Thursday?\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check with another method. Maybe using a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday, then June 30 would be a Sunday. Because June has 30 days, so July 1 is Monday, so June 30 is Sunday. Then June 29 would be Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous answer. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. Let me think. For example, I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 8 is Wednesday again. So June 29 would be 28 days later. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so June 29 would be Wednesday again. But that contradicts the previous answer. So now I'm really confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check an actual calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to find another way. Let me try again.\n\nIf January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then let's check some dates. For example, January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday again. January 15, 22, 29. So January 29 is a Sunday. Then February 5 is Sunday. February 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7, 14, 21, 28. June 4, 11, 18, 25. So June 25 is a Sunday. Then June 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday. So June 29 would be Thursday. That matches my first calculation. But earlier when I thought July 4 was Monday, that would imply June 29 is Saturday. But maybe that's wrong. Let me check again.\n\nIf July 4 is a Monday, then June 30 is Sunday. So June 29 is Saturday. But according to the other method, June 29 is Thursday. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that July 4, 2022 is a Monday is wrong. Let me check. I think July 4, 2022 was actually a Monday. Wait, but if June 29 is Thursday, then July 1 would be Saturday. So July 4 would be Tuesday. That contradicts. So maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me verify January 1, 2022. I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. That seems correct. So if January 1, 2022 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. So January 29 is Sunday. Then February 5 is Sunday. February 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7, 14, 21, 28. June 4, 11, 18, 25. So June 25 is Sunday. Then June 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday. So June 29 is Thursday. Therefore, July 1 is Saturday. Then July 4 would be Tuesday. So July 4 is Tuesday. But I thought it was Monday. Maybe I was wrong. So that would mean that my first calculation is correct. Therefore, June 29 is Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If June 1 is Wednesday, then June 8 is Wednesday, 15, 22, 29. So June 29 is Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. Now I'm really confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, this is a problem. There's inconsistency here. Let me try to resolve this. If June 1 is Wednesday, then June 29 is 28 days later, which is 4 weeks, so also Wednesday. But according to the previous calculation, June 29 is Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that June 1 is Wednesday is wrong. Let me check. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 29 is Sunday. Then February 5 is Sunday. February 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7, 14, 21, 28. June 4, 11, 18, 25. So June 25 is Sunday. Then June 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday. So June 29 is Thursday. Therefore, June 1 would be 28 days before June 29. 28 days is 4 weeks, so June 1 would be Thursday minus 4 weeks, which is Thursday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, if June 29 is Thursday, then June 28 is Wednesday, June 27 Tuesday, June 26 Monday, June 25 Sunday. So June 25 is Sunday. Then June 24 is Saturday, 23 Friday, 22 Thursday, 21 Wednesday, 20 Tuesday, 19 Monday, 18 Sunday, 17 Saturday, 16 Friday, 15 Thursday, 14 Wednesday, 13 Tuesday, 12 Monday, 11 Sunday, 10 Saturday, 9 Friday, 8 Thursday, 7 Wednesday, 6 Tuesday, 5 Monday, 4 Sunday, 3 Saturday, 2 Friday, 1 Thursday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if June 25 is Sunday, then June 24 is Saturday, June 23 is Friday, June 22 is Thursday, June 21 is Wednesday, June 20 is Tuesday, June 19 is Monday, June 18 is Sunday, June 17 is Saturday, June 16 is Friday, June 15 is Thursday, June 14 is Wednesday, June 13 is Tuesday, June 12 is Monday, June 11 is Sunday, June 10 is Saturday, June 9 is Friday, June 8 is Thursday, June 7 is Wednesday, June 6 is Tuesday, June 5 is Monday, June 4 is Sunday. So June 4 is Sunday. Then June 5 is Monday, 6 Tuesday, 7 Wednesday, 8 Thursday, 9 Friday, 10 Saturday, 11 Sunday, 12 Monday, 13 Tuesday, 14 Wednesday, 15 Thursday, 16 Friday, 17 Saturday, 18 Sunday, 19 Monday, 20 Tuesday, 21 Wednesday, 22 Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday, 25 Sunday. So June 25 is Sunday. Therefore, June 1 is 24 days before June 25. 24 days is 3 weeks and 3 days. So June 25 is Sunday, so June 1 is Sunday minus 3 days, which is Thursday. So June 1 is Thursday. But earlier I thought June 1 was Wednesday. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, my previous assumption that June 1 is Wednesday must be wrong. So according to this, June 1 is Thursday. Then June 29 is Thursday + 28 days, which is 4 weeks, so Thursday again. So June 29 is Thursday. Therefore, the correct answer is Thursday.\n\nBut then why did I think June 1 was Wednesday? Maybe I confused it with another year. So according to this calculation, June 29, 2022 is Thursday. Therefore, the answer should be Thursday.", "Thursday"], [49, "What day of the week was May 31, 2022?

Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yeah, that seems right. So if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then I can count the days from there to May 31.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use a different approach. Let me think about known dates. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, maybe I should check. Let me try to count. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is also Sunday. Then January 15, 22, 29. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26, April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Then May 7, 14, 21, 28. So May 28 is a Sunday. Then May 29 is Monday, 30 is Tuesday, 31 is Wednesday. Wait, so May 31, 2022 would be a Wednesday? But I need to make sure that my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 being a Sunday is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check an online calendar or use a formula. Wait, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think again. Let's take a known date. For example, I remember that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. Then May 6 is Friday, 13, 20, 27. So May 27 is Friday. Then May 28 is Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then January 1 is Sunday. Then January 1 + 31 days is January 31, which is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 31 would be Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. Then February 1 is Thursday. Then February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year), so February 28 is 28 days later, which is exactly 4 weeks, so same day as February 1, which is Thursday. So March 1 is a Thursday. March has 31 days, so March 31 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 31 is Thursday + 3 days = Sunday. Then April 1 is a Monday. Wait, but earlier I thought April 1 was a Friday. That's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if March 1 is Thursday, then March 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. Then April 5 is Thursday. So April 1 would be three days before April 5, which is Monday. So April 1 is Monday. Then April 8 is Monday, 15, 22, 29. Then May 6 is Monday. So May 6 is Monday. Then May 13 is Monday, 20, 27. So May 27 is Monday. Then May 28 is Tuesday, 29 Wednesday, 30 Thursday, 31 Friday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. Then May 30 is Monday, 31 Tuesday. But that would mean May 31 is Tuesday. But earlier calculations suggested different things. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If I can confirm that, then May 31 would be 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. So May 31 would be Tuesday. But earlier when I thought April 1 was Monday, then May 6 was Monday, leading to May 27 being Monday, then May 31 would be Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that again. Let me think about 2021. I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So maybe I was wrong before. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then let's recalculate.\n\nJanuary 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. January 31 is 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So January 31 is Saturday + 2 days = Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is Tuesday. March 1 is Wednesday. March has 31 days, so March 31 is Wednesday + 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So March 31 is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. April 1 is Saturday. April has 30 days, so April 30 is Saturday + 29 days. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day. So April 30 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. So May 1 is Monday. Then May 8 is Monday, 15, 22, 29. May 31 is 2 days after May 29, which is Monday + 2 days = Wednesday. Wait, so May 31 would be Wednesday? But earlier when I thought May 1 was Sunday, that would lead to May 31 being Tuesday. So now I'm confused again. Which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another known date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but according to this calculation, May 1 is Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

April 26 is Wednesday. May 3 is Wednesday. May 10 is Wednesday. May 17 is Wednesday. May 24 is Wednesday. May 31 is Wednesday. So according to this, May 31, 2022 is Wednesday. But if May 1 is Monday, then May 31 is 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Monday + 2 days is Wednesday. So that's consistent. So May 31 is Wednesday. But earlier I thought May 1 was Sunday, which would be conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about May 1 being Sunday. Let me check another way. If May 1 is Monday, then May 8 is Monday. Let's check if that's correct. If March 1 is Wednesday, then March 29 is Wednesday. April 5 is Wednesday. April 12 is Wednesday. April 19 is Wednesday. April 26 is Wednesday. May 3 is Wednesday. So May 3 is Wednesday. Then May 1 is two days before that, which is Monday. So that's correct. So May 1 is Monday. Therefore, May 31 is 30 days later, which is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Monday + 2 days is Wednesday. Therefore, May 31, 2022 is Wednesday. But I need to confirm this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but according to this calculation, it's Monday. So which is correct? Maybe I need to check a different approach. Let me think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is Monday, then June 30 is Sunday. Let's see if that aligns with the previous calculations. If May 31 is Wednesday, then June 1 is Thursday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is Thursday + 29 days. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day. So June 30 is Thursday + 1 day = Friday. Then July 1 is Saturday. July 4 is Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting because I thought July 4 was Monday. So that suggests that my previous calculation is wrong. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If May 31 is Wednesday, then June 1 is Thursday. June 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. July 6 is Thursday. July 4 is two days before that, which is Tuesday. So that would mean July 4 is Tuesday. But I thought it was Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my previous conclusion that May 31 is Wednesday must be wrong.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me try to use the fact that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. If that's the case, then May 31 is 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. So May 31 would be Tuesday. But how do I know if May 1 is Sunday?\n\nAlternatively, I can check the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but how do I confirm that? Maybe I can use the fact that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. If April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. May 6 is Friday. So May 6 is Friday. Then May 1 is 5 days before that, which is Sunday. So that would mean May 1 is Sunday. Then May 31 is 30 days later, which is 4 weeks and 2 days. Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. So May 31 would be Tuesday. But earlier calculations suggested Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 1 is Friday. Then April 8 is Friday. April 15 is Friday. April 22 is Friday. April 29 is Friday. May 6 is Friday. So May 6 is Friday. Then May 1 is 5 days before that, which is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. May 31 is two days after May 29, which is Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. So May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer should be Tuesday. But earlier when I thought January 1 was Saturday, I got Wednesday. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh, I think the mistake was in the initial assumption about January 1, 2022. If May 1 is Sunday, then let's backtrack. Let's check what day January 1, 2022 was. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 1 is Sunday. Let's count back. May has 31 days, so April 30 is Saturday. April has 30 days, so April 30 is Saturday. March 31 is Friday. February 28 is Thursday. January 31 is Wednesday. Then January 1 is 30 days before January 31. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So January 1 is Wednesday - 2 days = Monday. Wait, but that would mean January 1, 2022 is Monday. But earlier I thought it was Saturday. So this is conflicting. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that May 1 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday. May 15 is Sunday. May 22 is Sunday. May 29 is Sunday. Then May 31 is two days after May 29, which is Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. So May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.

If May 31 is Tuesday, then June 1 is Wednesday. That's correct. So if June 1 is Wednesday, then May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, that seems to align. So the correct answer is Tuesday. Therefore, May 31, 2022 was a Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [49, "Count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022 - what's the weekday? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022, and find out what day of the week that falls on. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can divide 81 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 81 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 4 days because 11 times 7 is 77, and 81 minus 77 is 4. So, going back 81 days is the same as going back 11 weeks and 4 days. Since 11 weeks is exactly 77 days, which brings me back to the same day of the week, the remaining 4 days will determine the weekday.\n\nNow, starting from Tuesday, October 4, 2022. If I go back 4 days, what day would that be? Let's count. One day before Tuesday is Monday, two days before is Sunday, three days before is Saturday, and four days before is Friday. Wait, so going back 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday? But wait, that seems off. Let me check again. If today is Tuesday, then yesterday was Monday (1 day back), the day before that was Sunday (2 days back), then Saturday (3 days back), and Friday (4 days back). Yes, that's correct. So going back 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday. Therefore, 81 days before Tuesday, October 4, 2022, would be a Friday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this with another method to be sure. Maybe by checking the actual dates. Let me try to count backward step by step. Starting from October 4, 2022. Let's subtract days one by one. But that might take too long. Alternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's see. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 4 days would be September 30, 2022. Wait, but that's only 4 days back. But I need to go back 81 days. Let me think of breaking it down into months.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or a date calculator. But since I don't have that here, I need to calculate it manually. Let's try to break down 81 days into months. Let's start from October 4, 2022. Going back 81 days. Let's subtract months first. October has 31 days, so if I go back 1 month (September), that's 30 days (since September has 30 days). Wait, but October 4 minus 30 days would be September 4, 2022. Then, subtracting another 30 days would take me to August 4, 2022. But that's 60 days back. Then, 81 - 60 = 21 days more. So from August 4, 2022, subtract 21 days. August has 31 days, so August 4 minus 21 days is July 14, 2022. Wait, but that's 81 days back? Let me check the math again. October 4 minus 30 days is September 4 (30 days back). Then another 30 days is August 4 (60 days back). Then 21 days more would be July 21 (since August 4 minus 21 days is July 21, 2022). Wait, but that's 81 days back. But I need to check if that's correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me count again. From October 4, 2022, going back 30 days is September 4. Then another 30 days is August 4. Then 21 days more would be July 21. So total 30+30+21=81 days. So July 21, 2022. Now, what day of the week was July 21, 2022?\n\nBut how do I find that? Well, I know that October 4, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check if I can find the day of the week for July 21, 2022. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I already calculated that going back 4 days from Tuesday is Friday. But if I go back 81 days, which is 11 weeks and 4 days, then the day should be Friday. But if I go through the date calculation, I get July 21, 2022. Let me check if that's a Friday. Wait, I need to verify this. Maybe I can use another approach. Let's check the day of the week for July 21, 2022. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that I know that October 4, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let me check the days for some known dates. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If July 1, 2022, was a Friday, then July 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Fridays. So July 22, 2022, would be a Saturday. Therefore, July 21 would be a Friday. So that matches with the previous calculation. So if July 21 is a Friday, then that would be the correct answer. Therefore, going back 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022, would be Friday, July 21, 2022. So the weekday is Friday.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that my initial calculation of 81 days being 11 weeks and 4 days is correct. 11 weeks is 77 days, 81-77=4 days.

Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so first, I need to figure out how many days are there from January 1st to March 25th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the year. Since the first day of the year is a Saturday, I assume it's a non-leap year unless specified otherwise. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention whether it's a leap year or not. Hmm. Wait, but March 25th is in the same year, so if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a common year? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that doesn't require knowing if it's a leap year. Let me check.\n\nWait, the first day of the year is a Saturday. Let's assume it's a common year unless told otherwise. So January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31 days. So March 25th would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (March) days? Wait, no. Wait, the total days from January 1st to March 25th would be the sum of the days in January, February, and the days in March up to the 25th. So January has 31 days, February has 28 (assuming non-leap year), and March 25th is 25 days into March. So total days would be 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but wait, if you count from January 1st to March 25th inclusive, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (March) = 84 days. But if you're calculating the number of days between January 1st and March 25th, you need to subtract 1 because the first day is day 1. Wait, no. Let me think again. If January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, etc. So the number of days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (March) = 84 days. But since we're starting on day 1 (Saturday), then day 1 is Saturday, day 2 is Sunday, and so on. So to find the day of the week for March 25th, we need to find the number of days between January 1st and March 25th, then take that number modulo 7. Because each week has 7 days.\n\nSo total days from Jan 1 to March 25 is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but wait, if January 1 is day 1, then March 25 is day 84. So the number of days after January 1 is 83 days. Because day 1 is the first day. So the difference between March 25 and January 1 is 83 days. So 83 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder gives the day of the week. Let me calculate 83 divided by 7. 7*11=77, 83-77=6. So remainder 6. So 6 days after Saturday. Let's count: Saturday (0), Sunday (1), Monday (2), Tuesday (3), Wednesday (4), Thursday (5), Friday (6). So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. Wait, but wait, if the first day is Saturday, then adding 1 day is Sunday, 2 is Monday, etc. So if the remainder is 6, then Saturday + 6 days is Friday. So March 25 would be a Friday? But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1. Then March 25 is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 25 is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. But if January 1 is day 1, then March 25 is day 84. So the number of days between January 1 and March 25 is 83 days. Because day 1 is the first day. So 83 days later. So 83 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Saturday. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. So the answer would be Friday?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check with another approach. Let's count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1st as Saturday. Then January 8th is also a Saturday. Then January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. So March 26th is a Saturday. Therefore, March 25th would be Friday. That matches the previous calculation. So the answer is Friday.

If that's correct, then the first Thursday would be the 3rd. Because November 1 is Tuesday, so the next day is Wednesday (2nd), then Thursday is the 3rd. So the first Thursday is the 3rd. Then the second Thursday would be the 10th, and the third would be the 17th. Wait, but wait, let me check again. If November 1 is Tuesday, then:\n\n- 1st: Tuesday\n- 2nd: Wednesday\n- 3rd: Thursday (first Thursday)\n- 10th: Thursday (second)\n- 17th: Thursday (third)\n- 24th: Thursday (fourth)\n- 31st: Thursday (fifth)\n\nSo the third Thursday would be the 17th. But wait, I need to make sure that November 2022 actually has 31 days. Yes, November has 30 days. Wait, no, wait. Wait, November has 30 days. Wait, no, wait. Wait, November has 30 days. Wait, but 31st is not in November. Wait, so if the third Thursday is the 17th, then the fourth would be the 24th, and the fifth would be the 31st. But November only has 30 days. So the fifth Thursday would be the 31st, which doesn't exist. Therefore, the third Thursday is the 17th. So the answer should be 17. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again. Let me look up the actual calendar for November 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can calculate it. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think. If I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, I think January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should check that. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check that. For example, if I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Wait, December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Then November 30, 2022, would be a Wednesday. So November 30 is Wednesday. Then November 29 is Tuesday, 28 is Monday, 27 is Sunday, 26 is Saturday, 25 is Friday, 24 is Thursday. So the fourth Thursday is the 24th. Then the third Thursday would be the 17th. So that seems correct. Therefore, the third Thursday is the 17th. So the answer is 17.", "17"], [49, "Count the occurrences of Thursday from Sunday, April 3 to Tuesday, June 28, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

First, I should figure out the dates of each Thursday in that range.\n\nLet me start by checking what day of the week April 3, 2022, is. The user said it's a Sunday. So April 3 is a Sunday. Then April 4 would be a Monday, April 5 Tuesday, April 6 Wednesday, April 7 Thursday. So the first Thursday in the range is April 7, 2022.\n\nNow, I need to list all the Thursdays from April 7 up to June 28. Let me break it down month by month.\n\nApril: Starting from April 7, then adding 7 days each time. So April 7, 14, 21, 28. Wait, April has 30 days. So April 28 is a Thursday. Then May 5, 12, 19, 26. Then June 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. But wait, the end date is June 28. So June 30 is beyond that. So the last Thursday would be June 23. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me verify each month's Thursdays step by step.\n\nApril 2022:\n- April 7 (Thursday)\n- April 14\n- April 21\n- April 28\n\nThat's four Thursdays in April.\n\nMay 2022:\n- May 5 (Thursday)\n- May 12\n- May 19\n- May 26\n\nThat's four more, so total 8 so far.\n\nJune 2022:\nNow, June 1, 2022, is a Wednesday. Let me check that. Wait, if May 26 is a Thursday, then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, June 1 Tuesday? Wait, maybe I need to check the actual days. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 28 is a Tuesday. Let me check that. If June 28 is a Tuesday, then June 27 is Monday, 26 Sunday, 25 Saturday, 24 Friday, 23 Thursday. So June 23 is a Thursday. Then the next Thursday would be June 30, but that's after June 28. So in June, the Thursdays are June 23, and then the next one is July 7, which is outside the range. So only one Thursday in June.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm the days again. Let me check the actual dates. Let me think of the days of the week for June 2022.\n\nIf June 28 is a Tuesday, then June 23 is a Thursday. Then June 22 is Wednesday, 21 Tuesday, 20 Monday, 19 Sunday, 18 Saturday, 17 Friday, 16 Thursday. So June 16 is a Thursday. Then June 23, 30. But June 30 is after June 28, so only June 23 is included. So that's one Thursday in June.\n\nSo total Thursdays would be April (4) + May (4) + June (1) = 9?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the days. Let me check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to calculate.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the number of days between April 3 and June 28, and then see how many weeks there are, but that might not be accurate because the start and end days might not align.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the first day of April 2022. Wait, April 3 is a Sunday. So April 1 is a Friday. Let me check that. April 3 is Sunday, so April 1 is Friday, April 2 Saturday, 3 Sunday. Correct.\n\nSo April 1 is Friday. Then April 7 is Thursday. Then April 14, 21, 28. Then May 5, 12, 19, 26. Then June 2, 9, 16, 23. Wait, June 2 is a Thursday? Let me check. If May 26 is a Thursday, then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, June 1 Tuesday, June 2 Wednesday? Wait, that can't be. Wait, if May 26 is Thursday, then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, June 1 Tuesday, June 2 Wednesday. So June 2 is Wednesday. Then June 3 is Thursday. Wait, that would mean that June 3 is a Thursday. But earlier I thought June 23 was a Thursday. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if June 2 is Wednesday, then June 3 is Thursday. Then June 10 is Thursday, 17, 24, 31. But June 31 is beyond June 28. So in June, the Thursdays would be June 3, 10, 17, 24. But June 24 is within the range (June 28 is the end date). So that's four Thursdays in June. But earlier I thought June 23 was a Thursday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that May 26 is a Thursday is wrong. Let me check again. April 7 is Thursday. Then April 14, 21, 28. Then May 5, 12, 19, 26. So May 5 is Thursday. Then May 5 + 7 days is May 12, then 19, 26. So May 26 is Thursday. Then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, June 1 Tuesday, June 2 Wednesday, June 3 Thursday. So June 3 is Thursday. Then June 10, 17, 24. So that's four Thursdays in June. But June 24 is before June 28, so that's included. So that's four Thursdays in June. So total would be April 4, May 4, June 4, total 12? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, April has 4, May 4, June 4? That would be 12. But that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, April 7, 14, 21, 28: 4 Thursdays.\n\nMay 5, 12, 19, 26: 4 Thursdays.\n\nJune 3, 10, 17, 24: 4 Thursdays.\n\nSo total 12? But the end date is June 28. So June 24 is included, and the next Thursday is June 30, which is after June 28. So that's correct. So 4+4+4=12? But the user said the end date is June 28, which is a Tuesday. So June 28 is Tuesday. So June 24 is Thursday, then June 25 is Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday? Wait, that contradicts earlier. Wait, if June 3 is Thursday, then June 10 is Thursday, 17, 24. Then June 24 is Thursday. Then June 25 is Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday. So June 28 is Monday. But the user said the end date is Tuesday, June 28. So that's a problem. So my previous assumption that June 3 is Thursday must be wrong. Therefore, there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the days. Let me check again. Let's start from April 3, 2022, which is Sunday. So April 3 is Sunday. Then April 4 is Monday, 5 Tuesday, 6 Wednesday, 7 Thursday. So April 7 is Thursday. Then April 14, 21, 28. So April 28 is Thursday. Then May 5 is Thursday. May 5 + 7 days is May 12, 19, 26. So May 26 is Thursday. Then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday. June 1 is Tuesday, June 2 is Wednesday, June 3 is Thursday. So June 3 is Thursday. Then June 10, 17, 24. June 24 is Thursday. Then June 25 is Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday. So June 28 is Monday. But the user said the end date is Tuesday, June 28. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. Where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake? Or maybe I miscalculated the days. Alternatively, maybe the start date is Sunday, April 3, and the end date is Tuesday, June 28. So maybe June 28 is actually a Tuesday. Let me check that. If June 28 is Tuesday, then June 24 is a Thursday. So June 24 is Thursday, then June 25 is Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday. Wait, that would make June 28 a Monday. But the user says it's Tuesday. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start date is correct, but the end date is different. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check the actual days for 2022. For example, April 3, 2022, is a Sunday. Let me check that. According to my knowledge, April 3, 2022, was a Sunday. Then April 7 is Thursday. Then May 5 is Thursday. May 26 is Thursday. Then June 3 is Thursday. June 10, 17, 24. Then June 24 is Thursday. Then June 25 is Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday. So June 28 is Monday. But the user says the end date is Tuesday, June 28. So that's conflicting. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake in the end date? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the end date is June 28, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let me check that. Let me think of the days. If June 28 is a Tuesday, then June 24 is a Friday? Wait, no. If June 28 is Tuesday, then June 24 is a Friday (since 28-24=4 days before, so 4 days before Tuesday is Friday). Wait, that can't be. Wait, if June 28 is Tuesday, then June 27 is Monday, 26 Sunday, 25 Saturday, 24 Friday. So June 24 is Friday. Then June 24 is Friday. So that would mean that the previous Thursday is June 23. So June 23 is Thursday. Then June 24 is Friday. So that would mean that in June, the Thursdays are June 3, 10, 17, 23. So that's four Thursdays in June. Then June 23 is Thursday, and June 28 is Tuesday. So that would make sense. So where is the mistake in my previous calculation?\n\nAh, I think I messed up the days in June. Let me recheck. If May 26 is Thursday, then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday. June 1 is Tuesday, June 2 Wednesday, June 3 Thursday. So June 3 is Thursday. Then June 10, 17, 24. Then June 24 is Thursday. But if June 24 is Thursday, then June 25 is Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday. So June 28 is Monday. But the user says it's Tuesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. So either the user is wrong, or my calculation is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the start date is not April 3, 2022, but another date. Wait, the user says the start date is Sunday, April 3, 2022. Let me check that. According to online sources, April 3, 2022, was indeed a Sunday. So that's correct. Then May 26, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. May 26, 2022, was a Thursday. Then June 3, 2022, was a Thursday. Then June 24, 2022, was a Thursday. Then June 28, 2022, was a Monday. But the user says the end date is Tuesday, June 28. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the user's question, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the end date is June 28, 2022, which is a Monday, but the user said it's a Tuesday. So perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the days. Let me try another approach. Let's count the number of days between April 3 and June 28, and then see how many Thursdays are in that period.\n\nApril 3 to April 30: 28 days (since April 3 is day 0, April 4 is day 1, etc. Wait, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but that might not account for the exact start and end days.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the fact that April 3 is Sunday. So the first Thursday is April 7 (day 4). Then each week adds 7 days. Let's list all the Thursdays:\n\nApril 7, 14, 21, 28 (4 Thursdays).\n\nMay 5, 12, 19, 26 (4 more, total 8).\n\nJune 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (but June 30 is after June 28, so only up to June 23. So that's 4 Thursdays in June. Wait, but June 2 is Thursday? If May 26 is Thursday, then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday. June 1 is Tuesday, June 2 is Wednesday. Wait, that can't be. So June 2 is Wednesday, not Thursday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if May 26 is Thursday, then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday. June 1 is Tuesday, June 2 is Wednesday, June 3 is Thursday. So June 3 is Thursday. Then June 10, 17, 24. So that's four Thursdays in June. So June 24 is Thursday. Then June 25 is Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday. So June 28 is Monday. Therefore, the user's end date of Tuesday, June 28, is incorrect. But the user says it's Tuesday. So this is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the end date. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the end date is June 28, 2022, which is a Monday, and the user said Tuesday by mistake. In that case, the correct number of Thursdays would be 4 (April) + 4 (May) + 4 (June) = 12. But if the end date is actually June 28, which is Monday, then the last Thursday is June 24. So that's 12 Thursdays. But the user says the end date is Tuesday, so maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the user is correct, and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start date is Sunday, April 3, and the end date is Tuesday, June 28. Let me check the actual days for June 28, 2022. According to my knowledge, June 28, 2022, was a Tuesday. Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me check again. If June 3 is Thursday, then June 10 is Thursday, 17, 24. June 24 is Thursday. Then June 25 is Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday. So June 28 is Monday. But that contradicts the user's statement. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the days. Let me check another way. Let's count the number of days from April 3 to June 28.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 3 to April 30 is 28 days (since April 3 is day 0, April 4 is day 1, ..., April 30 is day 27). Then May has 31 days, so from May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 28 is 28 days. Total days from April 3 to June 28 is 28 + 31 + 28 = 87 days. Now, 87 days divided by 7 is 12 weeks and"], [49, "Between Tuesday, April 12, 2022 and Wednesday, June 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Monday occur?

First, I should check what day of the week April 12, 2022, was. Wait, the problem says that the start date is Tuesday, April 12, 2022. So that's a Tuesday. Then I need to count all the Mondays from that date up to and including June 1, 2022, which is a Wednesday.\n\nSo the first step is to figure out how many days are in total between those dates, and then determine how many Mondays fall within that period. Alternatively, maybe I can just list out the dates and count the Mondays. But that might take too long. Let me think of a better way.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the days of the week for the start and end dates. Since April 12, 2022, is a Tuesday, then April 13 is Wednesday, and so on. The end date is June 1, 2022, which is a Wednesday. So the period starts on a Tuesday and ends on a Wednesday. Now, I need to find how many Mondays are in this period.\n\nLet me break it down into months. April, May, and June. Let's first find out how many days are in each month. April has 30 days, May has 31 days, and June has 30 days. But since the period ends on June 1, which is the first day of June, maybe I need to check how many days are in April after April 12, then all of May, and then June up to June 1.\n\nWait, the total period is from April 12 to June 1, inclusive. So April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the number of days between two dates inclusive is (end date - start date + 1). But maybe I should calculate the total number of days first. Alternatively, maybe I can figure out the number of weeks and extra days.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to find the first Monday after April 12, 2022, and then count how many Mondays there are until June 1.\n\nSince April 12 is a Tuesday, the next Monday would be April 18, 2022. Let me check that. April 12 is Tuesday. Then April 13 is Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday. Yes, that's correct. So the first Monday is April 18.\n\nThen the next Mondays would be every 7 days. So April 18, 25, May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, then June 6, 13, 20, 27. Wait, but the end date is June 1. So June 27 is beyond June 1. So let's check.\n\nWait, let's list all the Mondays in the period:\n\nStarting from April 18 (Monday), then adding 7 days each time:\n\nApril 18, 25.\n\nMay 2, 9, 16, 23, 30.\n\nJune 6, 13, 20, 27.\n\nBut June 1 is the end date. So June 6 is after June 1. Therefore, the last Monday before or on June 1 would be May 30, 2022. Wait, May 30 is a Monday? Let me check.\n\nWait, May 2 is a Monday. Then May 9 is Monday, 16, 23, 30. So May 30 is a Monday. Then June 6 is the next Monday. But June 6 is after June 1. So the last Monday in the period is May 30. So how many Mondays are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\nApril 18, 25 (2 Mondays)\n\nMay 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5 Mondays)\n\nTotal of 2 + 5 = 7 Mondays.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if May 30 is indeed within the period. The period ends on June 1. So May 30 is definitely within the period. So that's correct. So total of 7 Mondays.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check the actual dates. Let me confirm the days of the week for these dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between April 12 and June 1, then divide by 7 and adjust for the remainder.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days. April 12 to April 30: 30 - 12 = 18 days, plus 1 (inclusive) is 19 days. Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 is 1 day. So total days is 19 + 31 + 1 = 51 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, if April 12 is day 1, then April 13 is day 2, etc. So from April 12 to April 30 is 19 days (since 30 - 12 + 1 = 19). Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 19 + 31 = 50 days. Then June 1 is the next day, so total days is 51. So the total period is 51 days.\n\nNow, 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 2 days. So there are 7 full weeks, which would account for 7 Mondays. Then there are 2 extra days. Since the period starts on a Tuesday, the first day is Tuesday, and the last day is Wednesday (June 1). So the extra days are Tuesday and Wednesday. Therefore, there are 7 Mondays in total. That matches the previous count. So the answer is 7.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If there are 51 days, and the first day is Tuesday, then the Mondays would be on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49. Let's check what day of the week those are.\n\nDay 1: Tuesday (April 12)\n\nDay 7: Tuesday + 6 days = Monday (April 18)\n\nDay 14: Monday + 7 days = Monday (April 25)\n\nDay 21: Monday (May 2)\n\nDay 28: Monday (May 9)\n\nDay 35: Monday (May 16)\n\nDay 42: Monday (May 23)\n\nDay 49: Monday (May 30)\n\nThen day 51 is June 1, which is Wednesday. So the next Monday would be day 56, which is June 6. So yes, there are 7 Mondays in total.

Oh right, so the first Wednesday is the 7th. Then the second Wednesday would be the 14th. So the answer would be 14. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, but maybe I got the starting day wrong. Let me check again. If December 1, 2022, was a Thursday, then the first Wednesday is the 7th. Then the second would be the 14th. But I need to make sure that December 2022 actually has 31 days. Yes, December has 31 days. So the second Wednesday would be the 14th. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the actual dates. For example, if I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday, then the first Wednesday is the 7th, the second is the 14th, the third is the 21st, and the fourth is the 28th. Then the fifth would be the 35th, but December only has 31 days, so that's not possible. So the second Wednesday is definitely the 14th. Therefore, the answer should be 14. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. For example, if I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday, then the first Wednesday is the 7th. So the second Wednesday is the 14th. So the answer is 14. But I need to make sure that December 1, 2022, was indeed a Thursday. Let me try to recall. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 1 would be 20 days earlier. Let's count. December 21 is Wednesday. December 1 is 20 days before. Let's see: 21 - 7 = 14 (Wednesday), 14 - 7 = 7 (Wednesday), 7 - 7 = 0 (Wednesday). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if December 21 is a Wednesday, then December 14 is also a Wednesday. Then December 7 is a Wednesday. So December 1 would be 6 days before December 7. December 7 is Wednesday, so December 1 would be a Thursday. Yes, that matches. So December 1, 2022, was a Thursday.

Let me start by checking the dates.\n\nMarch 19, 2022 is a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Wait, March 19, 2022: I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to calculate it. Let's think. January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nBut maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the fact that March 19 is a Saturday. So March 19 is Saturday. Then March 20 is Sunday, March 21 is Monday, and so on.\n\nSo the period starts on Saturday, March 19. The end is Sunday, May 8. Let me figure out how many days are in total between those dates, inclusive.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from March 19 to May 8, inclusive.\n\nMarch has 31 days. So from March 19 to March 31 is 31 - 19 = 12 days, but since March 19 is included, it's 12 + 1 = 13 days? Wait, no. Wait, if I start on March 19, then March 19 is day 1, March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13 (since 31 - 19 + 1 = 13). Then April has 30 days, so April 1 to April 30 is 30 days. Then May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total days would be 13 (March) + 30 (April) + 8 (May) = 51 days total.\n\nWait, but let me check again. March 19 to March 31: March 19 is day 1, March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13. So that's 13 days. Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days. Then May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. So total days between March 19 and May 8 inclusive is 51 days.\n\nNow, out of these 51 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nSince March 19 is a Saturday, the first day is Saturday. Then March 20 is Sunday. Then March 21 is Monday, and so on.\n\nSo the weekends in this period would be:\n\nMarch 19 (Saturday), March 20 (Sunday), March 27 (Saturday), March 28 (Sunday), April 3 (Saturday), April 4 (Sunday), April 10 (Saturday), April 11 (Sunday), April 17 (Saturday), April 18 (Sunday), April 24 (Saturday), April 25 (Sunday), April 31 (Saturday), May 1 (Sunday), May 2 (Monday), ... Wait, but May 8 is the end date, which is a Sunday. So let's list all the Saturdays and Sundays in this period.\n\nStarting from March 19 (Saturday):\n\nWeek 1: March 19 (Sat), March 20 (Sun)\n\nWeek 2: March 27 (Sat), March 28 (Sun)\n\nWeek 3: April 3 (Sat), April 4 (Sun)\n\nWeek 4: April 10 (Sat), April 11 (Sun)\n\nWeek 5: April 17 (Sat), April 18 (Sun)\n\nWeek 6: April 24 (Sat), April 25 (Sun)\n\nWeek 7: April 31 (Sat), May 1 (Sun)\n\nWeek 8: May 2 (Mon), May 3 (Tue), May 4 (Wed), May 5 (Thu), May 6 (Fri), May 7 (Sat), May 8 (Sun)\n\nWait, so May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. So that's two more weekends.\n\nSo let's count all the Saturdays and Sundays:\n\nMarch 19, 20, 27, 28, 31 (wait, March 31 is a Monday? Wait, March 19 is Saturday. March 20 is Sunday. March 21 is Monday. March 22 is Tuesday. March 23 is Wednesday. March 24 is Thursday. March 25 is Friday. March 26 is Saturday. March 27 is Sunday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, March 19 is Saturday. Then March 20 is Sunday. March 21 is Monday. March 22 is Tuesday. March 23 is Wednesday. March 24 is Thursday. March 25 is Friday. March 26 is Saturday. March 27 is Sunday. March 28 is Monday. Wait, so March 26 is Saturday, March 27 is Sunday. Then March 28 is Monday. So March 31 would be... March 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), 31 (Thu). So March 31 is a Thursday. So the next Saturday after March 27 (Sunday) is March 26 (Saturday)? Wait, no. Wait, March 26 is Saturday. March 27 is Sunday. Then March 28 is Monday. So the next Saturday is April 1 (since March 26 is Saturday, then April 1 is the next Saturday? Wait, March 26 is Saturday. March 27 is Sunday. March 28 is Monday. March 29 is Tuesday. March 30 is Wednesday. March 31 is Thursday. April 1 is Friday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, March 19 is Saturday. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nMarch 19: Saturday\n\nMarch 20: Sunday\n\nMarch 21: Monday\n\nMarch 22: Tuesday\n\nMarch 23: Wednesday\n\nMarch 24: Thursday\n\nMarch 25: Friday\n\nMarch 26: Saturday\n\nMarch 27: Sunday\n\nMarch 28: Monday\n\nMarch 29: Tuesday\n\nMarch 30: Wednesday\n\nMarch 31: Thursday\n\nSo April 1 is Friday. So April 1 is Friday. Then April 2 is Saturday. April 3 is Sunday. So the next Saturday after March 26 is April 2. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. So March 26 is Saturday, March 27 is Sunday. Then March 28 is Monday. So April 1 is Friday. So April 2 is Saturday. So the weekends in March are March 19, 20, 26, 27. Then April 2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 17, 23, 24, 30, 31. Then May 7, 8.\n\nWait, let me list all the Saturdays and Sundays in the period from March 19 to May 8 inclusive.\n\nStarting with March 19 (Saturday):\n\nMarch 19 (Sat)\n\nMarch 20 (Sun)\n\nMarch 26 (Sat)\n\nMarch 27 (Sun)\n\nApril 2 (Sat)\n\nApril 3 (Sun)\n\nApril 9 (Sat)\n\nApril 10 (Sun)\n\nApril 16 (Sat)\n\nApril 17 (Sun)\n\nApril 23 (Sat)\n\nApril 24 (Sun)\n\nApril 30 (Sat)\n\nMay 1 (Sun)\n\nMay 7 (Sat)\n\nMay 8 (Sun)\n\nSo that's the list. Let's count them:\n\nMarch: 19, 20, 26, 27 \u2192 4 days\n\nApril: 2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 17, 23, 24 \u2192 8 days\n\nMay: 7, 8 \u2192 2 days\n\nTotal weekends: 4 + 8 + 2 = 14 days.\n\nSo total days is 51. Business days would be 51 - 14 = 37 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because if there are 14 weekend days, then 51 - 14 = 37 business days. But let me verify the count of weekends again to make sure I didn't miss any or count extra.\n\nMarch 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun) \u2192 4.\n\nApril 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun), 16 (Sat), 17 (Sun), 23 (Sat), 24 (Sun) \u2192 8.\n\nMay 7 (Sat), 8 (Sun) \u2192 2. Total 14. That seems correct.\n\nSo 51 total days minus 14 weekends equals 37 business days. Therefore, the answer should be 37.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from March 19 (Saturday), the first business day is March 21 (Monday). Then March 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (Monday to Friday). That's 5 days.\n\nThen March 28 (Monday) to March 31 (Thursday): 4 days.\n\nApril 1 (Friday) to April 30 (Sunday). Wait, April 1 is Friday, so April 1 is business day. April 2 is Saturday (non-business), April 3 is Sunday (non-business). Then April 4 is Monday. So from April 1 to April 30, how many business days?\n\nApril has 30 days. Let's count the number of weekends in April. April 2 and 3 are weekends. Then 9, 10; 16, 17; 23, 24; 30, 31. Wait, but May 1 is Sunday. So April 30 is a Thursday? Wait, earlier I thought April 30 is Saturday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's check April 1 is Friday. Then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. April 4 is Monday. April 5 is Tuesday. April 6 is Wednesday. April 7 is Thursday. April 8 is Friday. April 9 is Saturday. April 10 is Sunday. April 11 is Monday. April 12 is Tuesday. April 13 is Wednesday. April 14 is Thursday. April 15 is Friday. April 16 is Saturday. April 17 is Sunday. April 18 is Monday. April 19 is Tuesday. April 20 is Wednesday. April 21 is Thursday. April 22 is Friday. April 23 is Saturday. April 24 is Sunday. April 25 is Monday. April 26 is Tuesday. April 27 is Wednesday. April 28 is Thursday. April 29 is Friday. April 30 is Saturday. Wait, so April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. So in April, the weekends are April 2,3; 9,10; 16,17; 23,24; 30, 31. But April only has 30 days, so April 30 is Saturday, and May 1 is Sunday. So in April, the weekends are 2,3; 9,10; 16,17; 23,24; 30. So that's 5 weekends in April (each weekend is two days, but April 30 is Saturday, and May 1 is Sunday. So in April, there are 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays? Wait, no. Let me count the number of Saturdays in April. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5 Saturdays. Sundays are April 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. But April 31 is not in the period. Wait, the period ends on May 8. So April 31 is not included. So in April, the Sundays are April 3, 10, 17, 24. That's four Sundays. So total weekends in April are 5 Saturdays and 4 Sundays, totaling 9 days. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 8 days. Hmm, this is conflicting with my previous count. So where is the mistake?\n\nEarlier, I listed April 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24 as 8 days. But according to this, April has 5 Saturdays (2,9,16,23,30) and 4 Sundays (3,10,17,24). So that's 5 + 4 = 9 days. So why the discrepancy?\n\nBecause in my previous count, I included April 30 as a Saturday, which is correct. But in the initial list, I had April 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24 (8 days). But April 30 is also a Saturday. So that's an extra day. So that's where the mistake was. So the correct number of weekends in April is 9 days (5 Saturdays and 4 Sundays). Therefore, my previous count of 14 weekends was wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nSo March had 4 weekend days (19,20,26,27). April has 9 weekend days (2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24,30). Then May has 2 weekend days (7,8). So total weekends are 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 days. Therefore, total business days would be 51 - 15 = 36 days. But this contradicts the previous count. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check again. The total days from March 19 to May 8 inclusive is 51 days. If there are 15 weekend days, then 51 - 15 = 36 business days. But I need to verify the weekends again.\n\nMarch 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun) \u2192 4 days.\n\nApril 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun), 16 (Sat), 17 (Sun), 23 (Sat), 24 (Sun), 30 (Sat) \u2192 that's 9 days.\n\nMay 7 (Sat), 8 (Sun) \u2192 2 days.\n\nTotal 4 + 9 + 2 = 15. So that's 15 weekend days. Therefore, business days would be 51 - 15 = 36.\n\nBut earlier I thought April had 8 weekend days, but that was incorrect. So the correct number is 15 weekends. Therefore, the answer should be 36.\n\nBut now I need to check again the total days. Let me recalculate the total days between March 19 and May 8 inclusive.\n\nMarch 19 to March 31: March 19 is day 1, March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13 (since 31 - 19 + 1 = 13). Then April has 30 days, so April 1 to April 30 is 30 days. Then May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. That's correct.\n\nSo if there are 15 weekend days, then 51 - 15 = 36 business days. But I need to make sure that the weekends are correctly counted.\n\nLet me list all the weekends again:\n\nMarch:\n\n- March 19 (Sat)\n- March 20 (Sun)\n- March 26 (Sat)\n- March 27 (Sun)\n\nApril:\n\n- April 2 (Sat)\n- April 3 (Sun)\n- April 9 (Sat)\n- April 10 (Sun)\n- April 16 (Sat)\n- April 17 (Sun)\n- April 23 (Sat)\n- April 24 (Sun)\n- April 30 (Sat)\n\nMay:\n\n- May 7 (Sat)\n- May 8 (Sun)\n\nThat's 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 days. So that's correct. Therefore, the business days are 51 - 15 = 36.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from March 19 (Saturday), the first business day is March 21 (Monday). Let's count the business days in each month.\n\nMarch:\n\nMarch 19 is Saturday (non-business), March 20 is Sunday (non-business). March 21 is Monday (business). March 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri). That's 5 days (21-25). Then March 26 is Saturday (non-business), March 27 is Sunday (non-business). March 28 is Monday (business). March 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed"], [49, "Determine if the year 2043 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2043 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2043 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2043 divided by 4. 4 times 510 is 2040, so 2043 minus 2040 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 2043 is not divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check the century year rule just in case. \n\nBut wait, 2043 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. Century years are like 1600, 1700, 1800, etc. So since 2043 isn't a century year, the second condition (divisible by 400) doesn't apply here. So the main thing is that it's not divisible by 4. Therefore, 2043 isn't a leap year. \n\nHmm, but let me confirm the division again. 4 times 500 is 2000. 2043 minus 2000 is 43. 43 divided by 4 is 10.75, so yeah, there's a remainder. So definitely not divisible by 4. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [49, "Count the occurrences of Monday from Friday, August 5 to Monday, August 29, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Wait, no, the question says the start date is August 5, but the user says \"Count the occurrences of Monday from Friday, August 5 to Monday, August 29, 2022\". Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Wait, the start date is August 5, which is a Friday? Or is it a Monday? Wait, maybe I need to check the actual calendar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the days between the dates. Let me think. Let's start by figuring out the day of the week for August 5, 2022. Let me recall that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I know that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, but if that's the case, then the start date is Friday, August 5. But the problem says \"from Friday, August 5 to Monday, August 29\". Wait, the problem says \"Count the occurrences of Monday from Friday, August 5 to Monday, August 29, 2022 (including both start and end dates).\" So the start date is Friday, August 5, and the end date is Monday, August 29. So the period includes all days from Friday, August 5, up to and including Monday, August 29. So I need to count how many Mondays are in that period.\n\nWait, but if August 5 is a Friday, then the first Monday would be August 7, 2022. Then each subsequent Monday would be every 7 days. Let me list them out. Let's see:\n\nStart date: August 5 (Friday)\nEnd date: August 29 (Monday)\n\nSo the Mondays in this period would be:\n\nAugust 7 (Monday)\nAugust 14 (Monday)\nAugust 21 (Monday)\nAugust 28 (Monday)\n\nWait, August 28 is a Monday.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think August 1, 2022, was a Monday. Let me confirm. If that's the case, then August 5 would be a Friday. Because August 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, 3 is Wednesday, 4 is Thursday, 5 is Friday. Yes, that's correct. So August 5 is Friday. Then the Mondays would be August 7, 14, 21, 28. So that's four Mondays. But the end date is August 29, which is a Tuesday. So the last Monday is August 28. Therefore, the count is 4 Mondays. But wait, the problem says \"from Friday, August 5 to Monday, August 29\". So the end date is included. So August 29 is a Monday? Wait, if August 28 is a Monday, then August 29 is Tuesday.

Wait, August 8 would be a Monday? Wait, no. Wait, if August 1 is Monday, then August 8 is the next Monday. So August 8 is Monday. Then August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. Wait, that would make August 29 a Monday. But that contradicts my previous thought. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I got the day of the week for August 1, 2022, wrong. Let me check. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then July 4 was a Monday. Wait, July 4, 2022, was a Monday. Then July 1 is Friday. Then July 8 is Friday again. Then July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. Then August 5 is Friday. So August 5 is Friday. Then August 6 is Saturday, August 7 is Sunday, August 8 is Monday. So August 8 is Monday. Then August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. So that would mean that August 29 is a Monday. Therefore, the end date is Monday, August 29. So the Mondays in the period from August 5 (Friday) to August 29 (Monday) would be August 8, 15, 22, 29. That's four Mondays. But wait, August 5 is Friday, so the first Monday is August 8. Then the next ones are 15, 22, 29. So that's four Mondays. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"from Friday, August 5 to Monday, August 29\". So the start date is Friday, August 5, and the end date is Monday, August 29. So the period includes all days from Friday, August 5, up to and including Monday, August 29. So the Mondays in that period are August 8, 15, 22, 29. That's four Mondays. Therefore, the answer is 4. But wait, let me check again. Let me count the days between August 5 and August 29. August 5 is Friday. August 29 is Monday. So the total number of days is 25 days (from 5th to 29th inclusive is 25 days). Let me check: 29 - 5 + 1 = 25 days.

Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1950 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 1950. First, divide 1950 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 487 is 1948, so 1950 minus 1948 is 2. That means 1950 divided by 4 is 487.5, which isn't a whole number. So 1950 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the rules, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check.

I remember that sometimes you can use known dates to calculate this. For example, if I know that a certain date is a specific day, I can count forward or backward to find others.\n\nFirst, I should check if I remember any key dates in 2022. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then I can count the days from there. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, I can use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of Zeller's Congruence or some other algorithm, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know some dates in 2022. For example, I remember that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. If May 1 is a Sunday, then adding days to get to May 16. Let's count: May 1 is Sunday, May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday. Then May 16 would be Monday. Wait, that seems possible. But I need to make sure that May 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is Friday, April 15 is Friday, and April 22 is Friday. Then May 1 would be the next day, which is Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I should check a calendar. But since I can't do that right now, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think again. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then May 1 would be the 30th day of April. Wait, April has 30 days. So April 1 is Friday, then April 30 is a Friday plus 29 days. Since 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day, so April 30 would be a Saturday. Then May 1 would be a Sunday. So that would mean May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, so May 16 would be Monday. So that would make May 16, 2022 a Monday.\n\nBut wait, I thought April 1 was a Friday. Let me check that again. If I remember that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Then March has 31 days, so March 1 is Tuesday, March 8 is Tuesday, March 15 is Tuesday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 29 is Tuesday. Then April 5 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is the previous week, so April 1 would be a Friday. Because March 29 is Tuesday, March 30 is Wednesday, March 31 is Thursday, April 1 is Friday. Yes, that makes sense. So April 1 is Friday. Then May 1 is Sunday. Therefore, May 16 is Monday. So the answer should be Monday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that with another method. If I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then May 16 is 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday plus 1 day is Monday. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is Monday.", "Monday"], [49, "On which weekday did April 5, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week April 5, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yeah, that seems right. So January 1, 2022 is Sunday.\n\nNow, I need to count the days from January 1 to April 5. Let's break it down month by month. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days because 2022 is not a leap year. March has 31 days. Then April 5 is the 5th day of April.\n\nSo total days from January 1 to April 5 would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 5 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 5 is 95 days. Wait, but that's from January 1 to April 5 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if I start counting from January 1 as day 1, then adding 31 days would take me to January 31. Then adding 28 days would take me to February 28. Then adding 31 days would take me to March 31. Then adding 5 days would take me to April 5. So total days from January 1 to April 5 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 5 = 95 days. But wait, that's if I include all those days. But if I want to find the day of the week, I need to calculate how many days have passed since a known date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of days between January 1, 2022 (Sunday) and April 5, 2022. Let's see. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later (since January 1 is day 0). Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of days after January 1. So if I want to find the day of the week for April 5, I can calculate how many days are between January 1 and April 5, then take that number modulo 7.\n\nSo January 1 is day 0 (Sunday). Then January 2 is day 1 (Monday), etc. So April 5 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 5 (Apr) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I count from January 1 to April 5, inclusive, that's 31 + 28 + 31 + 5 = 95 days. But if I want the number of days after January 1, it's 94 days. Because January 1 is day 0. So April 5 is 94 days after January 1.\n\nWait, maybe I should check that again. Let's count the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later (since January 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days would take me to March 1. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take me to April 1. Then April 5 is 4 days after April 1. So total days from January 1 to April 5 is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 4 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 4 is 93 days. Wait, that's 93 days. But earlier I had 95. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. Let me think of it as the number of days between January 1 and April 5. If I take January 1 as day 0, then January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31, February 28 is day 31 + 27 = 58. March 1 is day 59, March 31 is day 59 + 30 = 89. April 1 is day 90, April 5 is day 94. So that's 94 days after January 1. So 94 days.\n\nSo 94 days later. Now, since each week has 7 days, I can divide 94 by 7 and find the remainder. 7*13 is 91, so 94 - 91 is 3. So the remainder is 3. So that means April 5 is 3 days after Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 is Tuesday, +3 is Wednesday. So April 5, 2022 was a Wednesday?\n\nWait, but I need to confirm this. Alternatively, maybe I can check with another method. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then April 5 would be 4 days later. Friday + 4 days is Tuesday? Wait, that contradicts the previous result. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. If April 1 is a Friday, then April 5 is 4 days later. Friday + 1 is Saturday, +2 is Sunday, +3 is Monday, +4 is Tuesday. So April 5 would be Tuesday. But according to the previous calculation, it was Wednesday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check online, but since I can't, I need to rely on my knowledge. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me think. If January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday\n\nJanuary 15: Sunday\n\nJanuary 22: Sunday\n\nJanuary 29: Sunday\n\nFebruary 5: Sunday\n\nFebruary 12: Sunday\n\nFebruary 19: Sunday\n\nFebruary 26: Sunday\n\nMarch 5: Sunday\n\nMarch 12: Sunday\n\nMarch 19: Sunday\n\nMarch 26: Sunday\n\nApril 2: Sunday\n\nApril 9: Sunday\n\nWait, so April 2, 2022 was a Sunday. Then April 1 would be Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought that April 1 was a Friday. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nWait, if April 2 is Sunday, then April 1 is Saturday. So that would mean that April 5 is Wednesday (April 1: Saturday, April 2: Sunday, April 3: Monday, April 4: Tuesday, April 5: Wednesday). So that would align with the first calculation. But earlier I thought April 1 was Friday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nLet me check again. If January 1, 2022 is Sunday, then let's count the days for April 1. Let's count the number of days from January 1 to April 1.\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1. March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1. Wait, no. Wait, from March 1 to April 1 is 31 days (March has 31 days). So total days from January 1 to April 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I go from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1 (day 30 + 28 = 58). Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1 (day 58 + 31 = 89). So April 1 is day 89. Then April 2 is day 90. So if day 89 is April 1, then day 89 is the number of days after January 1. So 89 days after January 1 (Sunday) is April 1. Let's calculate 89 divided by 7. 7*12=84, 89-84=5. So 5 days after Sunday is Friday. Wait, that would mean April 1 is Friday. But earlier when I counted the Sundays, I thought April 2 was Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my counting of Sundays was wrong. Let me try again. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday (7 days later), January 15, 22, 29. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. So April 2 is Sunday. That would mean April 1 is Saturday. But according to the day count, April 1 is Friday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me check the number of days between January 1 and April 1. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1 (30 + 28 = 58 days). Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1 (58 + 31 = 89 days). So April 1 is 89 days after January 1. Now, 89 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 5 days. So 12 weeks is 84 days, 89-84=5. So 5 days after Sunday is Friday. So April 1 is Friday. But according to the Sunday count, April 2 is Sunday. So that would mean April 1 is Saturday. But that's conflicting. Where is the error here?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the Sunday count. Let me check again. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday (7 days later). Then January 15 is Sunday (14 days later), January 22 (21), January 29 (28). Then February 5 is 35 days later (28 + 7). February 12 is 42 days later (35 +7). February 19 is 49, February 26 is 56. March 5 is 56 +7=63. March 12 is 70, March 19 is 77, March 26 is 84. April 2 is 84 +7=91. Wait, so April 2 is 91 days after January 1. 91 divided by 7 is 13 weeks, so April 2 is Sunday. So that would mean April 1 is Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, April 1 is Friday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is confusing. There's a contradiction here. Let me check the day count again. If April 2 is 91 days after January 1, then 91 divided by 7 is 13 weeks, so April 2 is Sunday. Therefore, April 1 is Saturday. But according to the other calculation, April 1 is 89 days after January 1, which is 89 mod 7 = 5, so 5 days after Sunday is Friday. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me recount the days from January 1 to April 1. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1 (30 + 28 = 58 days). Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1 (58 + 31 = 89 days). So April 1 is 89 days after January 1. But according to the Sunday count, April 1 is Saturday. So 89 days after Sunday is Saturday? Let's check. 89 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (84 days) and 5 days. So 84 days later is the same day, Sunday. Then adding 5 days: Sunday + 5 days is Friday. So that would mean April 1 is Friday. But according to the Sunday count, April 1 is Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my Sunday count is wrong. Let me check again. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday (7 days later). Then January 15 is Sunday (14 days later). January 22 is Sunday (21 days later). January 29 is Sunday (28 days later). Then February 5 is Sunday (35 days later). February 12 is Sunday (42 days later). February 19 is Sunday (49 days later). February 26 is Sunday (56 days later). March 5 is Sunday (63 days later). March 12 is Sunday (70 days later). March 19 is Sunday (77 days later). March 26 is Sunday (84 days later). April 2 is Sunday (91 days later). So April 2 is Sunday. Therefore, April 1 is Saturday. So that would mean that April 1 is Saturday. But according to the day count, April 1 is 89 days after January 1, which is 89 mod 7 = 5. So 5 days after Sunday is Friday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the day count. Let me check the number of days between January 1 and April 1. If January 1 is day 0, then April 1 is day 89. But if April 1 is Saturday, then day 89 is Saturday. Let's check what day of the week day 89 is. If day 0 is Sunday, then day 7 is Sunday again. So day 84 is Sunday (12 weeks). Then day 85 is Monday, 86 Tuesday, 87 Wednesday, 88 Thursday, 89 Friday. Wait, that would mean April 1 is Friday. But according to the Sunday count, April 1 is Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Which is correct?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me check a known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, but according to the Sunday count, April 2 is Sunday, so April 1 is Saturday. But if April 1 is Friday, then April 2 is Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, April 1, 2022. Let me think of another way. If I know that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, how? Let me check. If March 1 is Tuesday, then March 8 is Tuesday, March 15, 22, 29. April 5 would be 14 days later (March 29 is Tuesday, April 5 is 6 days later: March 29 (Tue), March 30 (Wed), March 31 (Thu), April 1 (Fri), April 2 (Sat), April 3 (Sun), April 4 (Mon), April 5 (Tue). Wait, that would mean April 5 is Tuesday. But according to the previous calculation, if April 1 is Friday, then April 5 is Tuesday. But according to the Sunday count, April 1 is Saturday, so April 5 would be Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't, I need to rely on my knowledge. Wait, I think I remember that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If that's the case, then April 5 would be Tuesday. But according to the day count, April 1 is Friday. So that would mean that the day count calculation was correct. But why does the Sunday count suggest April 1 is Saturday?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the Sunday count. Let me recount the Sundays. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday (7 days later). Then January 15 is Sunday (14 days later). January 22 is Sunday (21 days later). January 29 is Sunday (28 days later). Then February 5 is Sunday (35 days later). February 12 is Sunday (42 days later). February 19 is Sunday (49 days later). February 26 is Sunday (56 days later). March 5 is Sunday (63 days later).

So the fourth Wednesday would be the 23rd? Wait, let me count again. First Wednesday is 2nd, second is 9th, third is 16th, fourth is 23rd. Then the fifth is 30th. So the fourth one is the 23rd. But wait, November has 30 days. So 23rd is a Wednesday. So the answer should be 23. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again. Maybe I should verify the actual calendar for November 2022.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method. Let's check online or recall that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday.

If January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then adding months. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Sunday. Then February 1 would be 31 days later. Since 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 would be a Wednesday. Then March 1 is 28 days later (February 2022 is not a leap year), so 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Wednesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be a Saturday. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 would be a Monday. Wait, but if April 1 is a Saturday, adding 30 days would be 4 weeks (28 days) plus 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. So May 1, 2022 is a Monday.

So February 1 is Wednesday. March 1 is 28 days after February 1, which is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also Wednesday. April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. So April 1 is Saturday. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. So May 1 is Monday. But if that's the case, then May 13 would be Saturday. But I think I might be mixing up the dates. Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was actually a Saturday. Wait, no, I need to be careful here. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday.

March 1 is 28 days after February 1, which is 4 weeks, so March 1 is Tuesday. April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. So April 1 is Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Friday + 2 days is Sunday. Therefore, May 1, 2022 is a Sunday.

Let me count:\n\nFirst Tuesday: 4th (since 1 is Saturday, 2 Sunday, 3 Monday, 4 Tuesday)\nSecond Tuesday: 11th (adding 7 days)\nThird Tuesday: 18th\nFourth Tuesday: 25th. Then the next one would be February 1st, but that's outside of January. So in January 2022, the fourth Tuesday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer should be 25. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me check another way. Maybe I can look up the actual calendar for January 2022. Wait, I can't access external resources, but I can recall. Alternatively, I can use another method. Let's think about the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So:\n\nWeek 1: 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri)\nWeek 2: 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue), 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri)\nWeek 3: 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun), 17 (Mon), 18 (Tue), 19 (Wed), 20 (Thu), 21 (Fri)\nWeek 4: 22 (Sat), 23 (Sun), 24 (Mon), 25 (Tue), 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri)\nWeek 5: 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon)\n\nSo the fourth Tuesday is the 25th.

The answer should be the day as a number, like 4 or 15, and if it doesn't exist, I should put -1. \n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022, was.

Wait, if October 1 is a Saturday, then October 7 would be the next Saturday, so that would make October 7 a Saturday. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that right now, I need to rely on my memory. Let me try to recall. I think October 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me check by counting. If October 1 is Saturday, then October 2 is Sunday, October 3 is Monday, October 4 is Tuesday, October 5 is Wednesday, October 6 is Thursday, October 7 is Friday. Wait, that would mean October 7 is a Friday. So the first Friday of October is the 7th. Then the second Friday would be the 14th, third is 21st, and fourth is 28th. So the fourth Friday would be October 28. But wait, October has 31 days, so 28 is valid. So the answer should be 28. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the days of the week for October 2022. If I can figure out the first Friday, then I can count the fourth one. Let me try to remember that October 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So the first Friday would be October 7. Then adding 7 days each time: 7, 14, 21, 28. So the fourth Friday is the 28th. That seems right. But I need to make sure that October 28 is indeed a Friday. Let me count again. If October 7 is Friday, then adding 7 days: 7 +7=14 (Friday), 14+7=21 (Friday), 21+7=28 (Friday). Yes, that's correct. So the fourth Friday is the 28th. Therefore, the answer should be 28. But wait, maybe I'm wrong about the first day. Let me check another way. For example, I know that October 31, 2022, was a Monday. Let's count backwards. October 31 is Monday. Then October 30 is Sunday, 29 is Saturday, 28 is Friday. So that confirms that October 28 is a Friday. So that's correct.

So I need to count all the Saturdays between those two dates, including both the start and end dates if they are Saturdays.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week each date is. The start date is Sunday, August 28, 2022. Let me check that. Wait, August 28, 2022 was a Sunday. Then the next day, August 29, 2022, would be a Monday. Then August 30 is Tuesday, August 31 is Wednesday. September 1 is Thursday, September 2 is Friday, September 3 is Saturday. So the first Saturday after August 28 would be September 3, 2022. Then the next ones would be September 10, 17, and 24, 31. But wait, the end date is September 8, 2022, which is a Thursday. So the last Saturday would be September 3, 2022.

So the first Saturday in that week would be August 27, but that's before the start date. So the first Saturday after August 28 is September 3. Then September 10 is the next one, but September 10 is after September 8. So between August 28 and September 8 inclusive, the only Saturday is September 3. Wait, but let me check again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nLet me list the dates from August 28 to September 8 and note the days of the week.\n\nAugust 28: Sunday\nAugust 29: Monday\nAugust 30: Tuesday\nAugust 31: Wednesday\nSeptember 1: Thursday\nSeptember 2: Friday\nSeptember 3: Saturday\nSeptember 4: Sunday\nSeptember 5: Monday\nSeptember 6: Tuesday\nSeptember 7: Wednesday\nSeptember 8: Thursday\n\nSo the dates from August 28 to September 8 inclusive include August 28 (Sunday) through September 8 (Thursday).

August 28 is Sunday, so the next Saturday would be August 27 (but that's before the start date). Then August 28 is Sunday, so the next Saturday is September 3. Then September 10 is the next Saturday, but that's beyond September 8. So only one Saturday in the given range. Therefore, the answer should be 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the days. Let me confirm the actual days. Let me check an online calendar or use another method. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of days between the two dates and then see how many Saturdays are in that period.\n\nThe start date is August 28, 2022 (Sunday), and the end date is September 8, 2022 (Thursday). Let's calculate the total number of days between them inclusive. From August 28 to September 8 is 11 days (including both ends).

August 28 to September 8 is 11 days? Let me check. August has 31 days. So from August 28 to August 31 is 4 days (28,29,30,31). Then September 1 to September 8 is 8 days. So total is 4 + 8 = 12 days. So the total number of days is 12. So from August 28 to September 8 inclusive is 12 days.\n\nNow, if the first day is Sunday (August 28), then the days of the week would be:\n\nDay 1: Sunday (Aug 28)\nDay 2: Monday (Aug 29)\nDay 3: Tuesday (Aug 30)\nDay 4: Wednesday (Aug 31)\nDay 5: Thursday (Sep 1)\nDay 6: Friday (Sep 2)\nDay 7: Saturday (Sep 3)\nDay 8: Sunday (Sep 4)\nDay 9: Monday (Sep 5)\nDay 10: Tuesday (Sep 6)\nDay 11: Wednesday (Sep 7)\nDay 12: Thursday (Sep 8)\n\nSo in these 12 days, the only Saturday is day 7, which is September 3. Therefore, there is 1 Saturday. So the answer should be 1. But wait, maybe I need to check if the end date is included. The problem says inclusive of both dates.

The end date is Saturday, December 31, 2022. Both dates are included.\n\nLet me list out the days between those two dates. December 30 is a Friday. Then December 31 is a Saturday.

Adding 6 days would be November 30 (Wednesday). Then adding another 7 days would be December 7 (Wednesday). So that's two Wednesdays. But wait, maybe I should check each day step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then see how many weeks there are. Let's see. From November 24 to December 7 is 14 days (since November has 30 days, so 30 - 24 = 6 days in November, plus 7 days in December, total 13 days? Wait, wait, November 24 to November 30 is 6 days (24th is day 0, 25th is +1, ..., 30th is +6). Then December 1 is +7, up to December 7 is +13 days. Wait, that's 14 days total? Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me count the days between November 24 and December 7 inclusive.\n\nWait, the start date is November 24 (Thursday), end date is December 7 (Wednesday).

And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so I need to figure out the day of the week for March 26, given that January 1st is a Tuesday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are there from January 1st to March 26th. Let me break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since the first day is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the first day of the year being a Tuesday. So if it's a non-leap year, February has 28 days. But if it's a leap year, February has 29. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that doesn't require knowing if it's a leap year? Wait, but March 26th is after February, so if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year? Or maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. Let me check. If the first day of the year is a Tuesday, then depending on whether it's a leap year or not, the number of days in February changes. So maybe I need to check if the problem is in a leap year or not. But the problem doesn't specify. Wait, maybe the problem is assuming a non-leap year? Because if it's a leap year, then the calculation would be different. But since the problem doesn't mention a leap year, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days. So adding those, 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 26th is 26 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 26th is 30 (January) + 28 (February) + 26 (March) = 84 days? Wait, no. Wait, January 1st is day 0. So January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and March 26th is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 26 (days in March) minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find the number of days from January 1st to March 26th inclusive, it's 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But if I want the number of days between January 1st and March 26th, not including January 1st, then it's 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. Let's say January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31, and February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59, and March 26th is day 59 + 25 = day 84. So the total number of days from January 1st to March 26th is 84 days. So if January 1st is a Tuesday, then adding 84 days later would be the same day of the week because 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 days later would be the same day. Wait, but that would mean March 26th is also a Tuesday? But that seems too easy. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1st is Tuesday, then January 8th is also Tuesday, and so on. So every 7 days, the same day of the week. So 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. So 84 days later would be the same day. Therefore, March 26th would be a Tuesday. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, but maybe I miscalculated the number of days. Let me check again. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to February 28th, which is 30 + 28 = 58 days after January 1st. Then March 26th is 26 days into March. So from February 28th to March 26th is 26 days. Wait, but February 28th is day 58. Then March 1st is day 59, March 2nd is 60, ..., March 26th is day 58 + 26 = day 84. So yes, 84 days after January 1st. So 84 divided by 7 is 12, so same day. Therefore, March 26th is Tuesday. But wait, that seems correct? But I remember that in some years, March 26th is not the same day. Wait, maybe I need to check with a different approach. Let me try to count the days step by step.\n\nLet me take January 1st as Tuesday. Then January 8th is Tuesday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Wait, so March 26th would be a Tuesday. So that's the same as the first day. So that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check if the year is a leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then February has 29 days. So in that case, the number of days from January 1st to March 26th would be 31 (January) + 29 (February) + 26 (March) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 31st is day 30. Then February 29th is day 30 + 28 = day 58? Wait, no. Wait, if January has 31 days, then February 1st is day 31. February 29th is day 31 + 28 = day 59. Then March 1st is day 60. March 26th is day 60 + 25 = day 85. So 85 days after January 1st. Then 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 1 day. So 85 days later would be 12 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1st is Tuesday, then adding 1 day would be Wednesday. So in a leap year, March 26th would be Wednesday. But the problem didn't specify whether it's a leap year or not. Hmm. So this is a problem. The question is ambiguous. But maybe the problem is assuming a non-leap year. Because if the first day of the year is a Tuesday, then the year could be a leap year or not. But how do I know? Wait, the problem says \"the first day of the year was a Tuesday\". So if the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But the problem doesn't mention anything about the year being a leap year. So maybe the problem is assuming a non-leap year. Because otherwise, the answer would depend on whether it's a leap year. But since the problem is given without any additional information, maybe it's intended to assume a non-leap year. Therefore, the answer would be Tuesday. But I need to check again. Wait, maybe the problem is in a specific year. For example, if the first day of the year is Tuesday, then the year could be 2023, which is not a leap year. Let me check. Wait, 2023 is not a leap year. January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but the problem says that the first day is Tuesday. So maybe it's a different year. But regardless, the problem is hypothetical. So the problem is asking for the day of the week given that the first day is Tuesday, regardless of the actual year. So if the problem is in a non-leap year, then March 26 is Tuesday. If it's a leap year, then March 26 is Wednesday. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is Tuesday. But maybe the problem is designed in a way that the number of days is 84, which is 12 weeks. So the answer is Tuesday. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a leap year. Wait, but how can I know? Maybe the problem is from a specific context where the year is not a leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to assume that the year is not a leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then the calculation would be different. But since the problem doesn't mention it, maybe the answer is Tuesday. Alternatively, maybe I should check the actual number of days between January 1 and March 26. Let me calculate again. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days. Then March 26 is 26 days. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 30 + 28 + 26 = 84 days if non-leap, or 30 + 29 + 26 = 85 days if leap. So 84 days is 12 weeks, so same day. 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day. So if the problem is in a non-leap year, answer is Tuesday. If leap, Wednesday. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is Tuesday. But maybe the problem is in a leap year. Wait, but how can I know? Maybe the problem is from a specific year. For example, if the first day of the year is Tuesday, then the year could be 2023 (which is not a leap year), but in that case, March 26, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's not matching. Wait, maybe I need to check. Wait, if January 1, 2023 was a Sunday, then March 26, 2023 was a Sunday. But the problem says that January 1 is a Tuesday. So maybe the problem is in a different year. But regardless, the problem is hypothetical. So the answer depends on whether it's a leap year. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is Tuesday. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to assume that the year is not a leap year. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the problem is from a specific context where the year is not a leap year. For example, if the first day of the year is Tuesday, then the year is not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, then the first day of the year would be different. Wait, no. The first day of the year is Tuesday regardless of whether it's a leap year. So the problem is just giving that the first day is Tuesday, and the rest is based on that. So the answer depends on the number of days between January 1 and March 26. So if the problem is in a non-leap year, then 84 days, which is 12 weeks, so same day. If it's a leap year, 85 days, which is 12 weeks and 1 day, so one day later. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is Tuesday. But maybe the problem is designed to assume that the year is not a leap year. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a leap year. But without more information, I think the answer is Tuesday.

Let me double-check the days.\n\nWait, December 2 is Friday. So adding days:\n\n2: Fri\n3: Sat\n4: Sun\n5: Mon\n6: Tue\n7: Wed\n\nYes, only the 7th is a Wednesday. So the count should be 1. But wait, the question says inclusive of both dates. So the start date is Friday, which is not a Wednesday, and the end date is Wednesday. So only one Wednesday in total. Therefore, the answer is 1.", "1"], [49, "If today is Thursday, February 3, 2022, what day of the week will it be in 84 days? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If today is Thursday, February 3, 2022, what day of the week will it be in 84 days? And I need to give the full weekday name. Alright, so I need to figure out what day of the week it will be 84 days from Thursday, February 3, 2022.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 84 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that calculation. 84 divided by 7 is 12. So that's exactly 12 weeks. Since 12 weeks is 84 days, that means adding 84 days would just be 12 weeks later. So if today is Thursday, then 12 weeks later would also be a Thursday. But wait, is that correct? Because if I add 7 days, it's the same day. So adding 7*12=84 days, yes, that's 12 weeks. So the day of the week should be the same. So the answer would be Thursday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, the original date is February 3, 2022. Let me check if 2022 is a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also by 400. 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, so not a leap year. So February has 28 days. So adding 84 days from February 3, 2022. Let me try to count the days step by step to make sure.\n\nStarting from February 3, 2022. Let's count the days. But maybe that's not necessary if the 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. But maybe I should check if the date is correct. Wait, if I add 84 days to February 3, 2022, what date would that be?\n\nLet me try to calculate. February has 28 days in 2022. So from February 3, adding 25 days would take me to February 28 (since 3 + 25 = 28). Then March has 31 days, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, etc. Wait, but maybe I should just add 84 days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since 84 is a multiple of 7, the day of the week should be the same. But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again. If today is Thursday, then adding 7 days is Thursday again. So adding 14 days is also Thursday, and so on. So 84 days is 12 times 7, so same day. Therefore, the answer should be Thursday. But maybe I need to check if the date is correct. Wait, maybe the problem is that when you add days, sometimes the month changes, but the day of the week is still the same. So even if the date changes, the day of the week is the same. So regardless of the actual date, adding 84 days would be 12 weeks, so same day. Therefore, the answer is Thursday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with an example. Let's say today is Thursday, February 3, 2022. Let's add 7 days: February 10, 2022, which is also a Thursday. Then adding another 7 days: February 17, 2022, Thursday again. So each week, same day. So 84 days is 12 weeks. So the day should be Thursday.

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. October 3, 2022 is a Monday. October 25, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to calculate it.\n\nFrom October 3 (Monday) to October 25 (Tuesday). Let's count the days. Let's see, October 3 is day 1. Then October 4 is Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, and so on. Wait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of weeks and the extra days. Let's see.

I need to figure out how many business days there are from Thursday, February 10, 2022, to Saturday, March 12, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates involved. Let me start by listing the dates from February 10 to March 12, 2022. But since the question includes both start and end dates, I need to make sure both are counted if they are business days.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. Maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, I can count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays in that period.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. February 10, 2022 is a Thursday. Let me check what day March 12, 2022 is. Wait, March 12 is a Saturday. So the period starts on a Thursday and ends on a Saturday. So the first day is a business day (Thursday), and the last day is a Saturday, which is a weekend. So the end date is not a business day. But since the question says inclusive, I need to include both dates. So I need to check if March 12 is a Saturday, which it is, so that day is excluded.\n\nSo the total days from February 10 to March 12 inclusive. Let me calculate the total number of days first. Let's see, February 2022 has 28 days because 2022 is not a leap year. So February 10 to February 28 is 28 - 10 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to add 1. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the total number of days between two dates inclusive can be calculated by subtracting the start date from the end date and adding 1. But maybe it's easier to count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a calendar approach. Let me list the dates from February 10 to March 12, 2022, and count the business days.\n\nStarting with February 10, 2022 (Thursday).

Feb 13: Sunday - no\n5. Feb 14: Monday - yes (3)\n6. Feb 15: Tuesday - yes (4)\n7. Feb 16: Wednesday - yes (5)\n8. Feb 17: Thursday - yes (6)\n9. Feb 18: Friday - yes (7)\n10.

So the answer should be 22. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days between the two dates and subtract the weekends. Let's try that method.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of days from February 10 to March 12 inclusive.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from February 10 to February 28 is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total days is 19 + 12 = 31 days. Wait, but that would be 31 days total. But when I counted the business days, I had 22. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, if there are 31 days total, and weekends are 2 days per week. Let's see how many weekends are in that period.\n\nFrom February 10 (Thursday) to March 12 (Saturday). Let's see how many weeks and days that is.\n\nFebruary 10 is Thursday. Let's see how many weeks and days between those dates.\n\nFrom February 10 to March 12 is 31 days. Let's check how many weekends are in that period.\n\nFirst, the first week starts on Thursday, February 10. The next week would be Friday, February 11. Then Saturday, February 12 (weekend), Sunday, February 13 (weekend). Then Monday, February 14, etc.\n\nSo in the first two weeks (February 10-13), there are two weekends (Feb 12-13). Then each subsequent week has two weekends. Let's calculate the number of weekends.\n\nTotal days: 31. Let's divide by 7. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks have 4*2=8 weekend days. Then the remaining 3 days are Thursday, Friday, Saturday (since the first day is Thursday). So in those 3 days, there are 2 weekend days (Saturday). So total weekends are 8 + 2 = 10. Therefore, business days would be 31 - 10 = 21. But earlier count was 22. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this suggests that there's a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, the total days from February 10 to March 12 inclusive. Let me check that again. February 10 to February 28 is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total is 19 + 12 = 31 days. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of weekends. Let's list the weekends in that period.\n\nWeekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nLet me list all the dates and check which are weekends.\n\nFebruary 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), 31 (Thu), March 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu), 8 (Fri), 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun), 11 (Mon), 12 (Tue).\n\nWait, wait, March 12 is Saturday. Wait, but March 12 is the end date. Wait, March 12 is Saturday. So the weekends in the period are:\n\nFebruary 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun). Wait, that's 10 weekends. So 10 weekend days. So 31 total days minus 10 weekend days equals 21 business days. But earlier when I counted manually, I had 22. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me recount the business days again, carefully.\n\nList of dates from Feb 10 to March 12:\n\nFeb 10 (Thu) - business\nFeb 11 (Fri) - business\nFeb 12 (Sat) - no\nFeb 13 (Sun) - no\nFeb 14 (Mon) - yes\nFeb 15 (Tue) - yes\nFeb 16 (Wed) - yes\nFeb 17 (Thu) - yes\nFeb 18 (Fri) - yes\nFeb 19 (Sat) - no\nFeb 20 (Sun) - no\nFeb 21 (Mon) - yes\nFeb 22 (Tue) - yes\nFeb 23 (Wed) - yes\nFeb 24 (Thu) - yes\nFeb 25 (Fri) - yes\nFeb 26 (Sat) - no\nFeb 27 (Sun) - no\nFeb 28 (Mon) - yes\nMarch 1 (Tue) - yes\nMarch 2 (Wed) - yes\nMarch 3 (Thu) - yes\nMarch 4 (Fri) - yes\nMarch 5 (Sat) - no\nMarch 6 (Sun) - no\nMarch 7 (Mon) - yes\nMarch 8 (Tue) - yes\nMarch 9 (Wed) - yes\nMarch 10 (Thu) - yes\nMarch 11 (Fri) - yes\nMarch 12 (Sat) - no\n\nNow, let's count the business days:\n\n1.

But according to the other method, it should be 21. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, the total days are 31. If there are 10 weekend days, then 31-10=21. But according to the manual count, there are 22 business days. So there's a contradiction here.

That's 10 weekend days. So 10 days. So 31-10=21. But manual count shows 22. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 31. Let me check again. From February 10 to March 12 inclusive.\n\nFebruary 10 is day 1. February 11 is day 2. February 12 is day 3. February 13 is day 4. February 14 is day 5. February 15 is day 6. February 16 is day 7.

Let's list all the weekend days in the period:\n\nFebruary 12 (Sat)"], [49, "Name the day of the week for 01/17/2022. Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week January 17, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. So if that's correct, then January 1, 2022 is a Sunday. Then January 17 would be 16 days later. Let me count. From January 1 to January 17 is 16 days. Since a week has 7 days, 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Sunday would be Monday and Tuesday. So January 17 would be a Tuesday? Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think I might be wrong here. Let me try to recall. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days because it was a leap year. So 2020 had 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be a Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I should check a calendar. But since I can't do that right now, I need to figure it out. Let me try again. Let's start from a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but if that's the case, then going back, 2022 would be one day earlier. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 starts on Saturday. So that would mean that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Then January 17 would be 16 days later. 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday plus 2 days is Monday. Wait, but that would make January 17, 2022 a Monday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check with another date. For example, I know that February 6, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, and January 16 is Sunday. So January 17 would be Monday. That seems to fit. So that would mean that January 17, 2022 is a Monday. But I need to confirm if January 1, 2022 is indeed a Saturday. Let me think again. If I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then 2022 would be one day earlier. So 2022 starts on Saturday. So that's correct. Therefore, January 17, 2022 would be a Monday. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me try using Zeller's Congruence.\n\nZeller's Congruence formula for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, I need to adjust the month and year accordingly. So for January 17, 2022, since it's January, I need to treat it as month 13 of 2021. Therefore, the adjusted month is 13, and the year is 2021. So:\n\nq = 17\nm = 13\nK = 21 (since 2021 mod 100 is 21)\nJ = 20 (since floor(2021 / 100) is 20)\n\nNow plug into the formula:\n\nh = (17 + floor((13*(13 + 1))/5) + 21 + floor(21/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each part step by step:\n\nFirst, compute floor((13*(13 + 1))/5) = floor((13*14)/5) = floor(182/5) = floor(36.4) = 36\n\nThen floor(21/4) = 5 (since 21 divided by 4 is 5.25, floor is 5)\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all together:\n\n17 + 36 + 21 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 17 + 36 is 53, plus 21 is 74, plus 5 is 79, plus 5 is 84, plus 100 is 184.\n\nNow compute 184 mod 7. Let's divide 184 by 7. 7*26 is 182, so 184 - 182 is 2. So h = 2.\n\nAccording to Zeller's Congruence, h=0 is Saturday, h=1 is Sunday, h=2 is Monday. Therefore, January 17, 2022 is a Monday. So that confirms my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer should be Monday.", "Monday"], [49, "Count the occurrences of Thursday from Monday, December 26 to Friday, December 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

First, I should figure out what day of the week each of these dates falls on. \n\nWait, the start date is Monday, December 26. So that's a Monday. Then December 27 is Tuesday, 28 is Wednesday, 29 is Thursday, and 30 is Friday. So the dates in question are Monday (26th), Tuesday (27th), Wednesday (28th), Thursday (29th), and Friday (30th). \n\nSo within this period, the only Thursday is the 29th. Let me check again. December 26 is Monday. So adding days: 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri). Yes, that's correct. So only one Thursday in that range. \n\nWait, but the problem says including both start and end dates. So the start is Monday, which is not a Thursday. The end is Friday, which is also not a Thursday. So the only Thursday is the 29th.

Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. And I need to answer with the complete weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st (Wednesday) and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. Since January 1st is a Wednesday, January 1st is day 0. Then, January 2nd is day 1, and so on. But maybe it's easier to count the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd, inclusive or exclusive? Wait, actually, since we need to find the weekday of April 3rd, we need to count how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd, then find the remainder when divided by 7 to determine the day of the week.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total days. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So maybe it's not a leap year? Or maybe it's a leap year? Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. So maybe I should assume it's a common year, unless told otherwise. But actually, the problem might not require knowing if it's a leap year because the answer might be the same regardless. Wait, but let me check.\n\nWait, if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year. But maybe the problem is designed in such a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Or maybe not. Let me think. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nBut maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption first. So, if it's a non-leap year, then February has 28 days, March has 31, and April has 30. So, from January 1st to April 3rd, how many days?\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 59 + 31 = 90 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 90 + 3 = 93 days. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 93 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then April 3rd is 93 days later? Let me check again.\n\nWait, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1st. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1st. Then April 3rd is 2 more days. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 2 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 2 is 91 days. Wait, that's 91 days. But that seems conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd inclusive is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93. But if we're counting the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd, inclusive, then that's 93 days. But if we're counting the number of days after January 1st, then it's 92 days. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1st is day 0 (Wednesday), then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is (April 3rd - January 1st) days. So, how many days is that?\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1st (day 30 + 28 = 58). Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1st (day 58 + 31 = 89). Then April 3rd is 2 days after April 1st, so day 89 + 2 = 91. Therefore, April 3rd is 91 days after January 1st.\n\nSo the total number of days is 91. Now, since each week has 7 days, we can divide 91 by 7 to find the number of weeks and the remainder will tell us the day of the week.\n\n91 divided by 7 is exactly 13 weeks with 0 remainder. So that means April 3rd is the same day of the week as January 1st, which is Wednesday. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if January 1st is Wednesday, then adding 7 days (January 8th) is also Wednesday, and so on. So 91 days later would be 13 weeks later, same day. So April 3rd would be Wednesday? But that seems too easy. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the days.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is day 0 (Wednesday).\n\nJanuary 8th is day 7 (Wednesday again).\n\nJanuary 15th is day 14 (Wednesday).\n\nJanuary 22nd is day 21 (Wednesday).\n\nJanuary 29th is day 28 (Wednesday).\n\nFebruary 5th is day 35 (Wednesday).\n\nFebruary 12th is day 42 (Wednesday).\n\nFebruary 19th is day 49 (Wednesday).\n\nFebruary 26th is day 56 (Wednesday).\n\nMarch 5th is day 63 (Wednesday).\n\nMarch 12th is day 70 (Wednesday).\n\nMarch 19th is day 77 (Wednesday).\n\nMarch 26th is day 84 (Wednesday).\n\nApril 2nd is day 91 (Wednesday). Wait, so April 2nd is day 91? Then April 3rd would be day 92. Wait, but 91 days after January 1st is April 2nd. So April 3rd is 92 days after January 1st. Then 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 92 days later would be 13 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1st is Wednesday, then adding 1 day would be Thursday. Therefore, April 3rd would be Thursday?\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 91 days later is April 2nd, which is Wednesday. Then April 3rd is one day later, so Thursday. So that would be the answer. But why did I get confused earlier?\n\nBecause when I calculated the total days between January 1st and April 3rd, I thought it was 91 days, but that's actually the number of days from January 1st to April 2nd. So April 3rd is one more day. So the total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 92 days. Therefore, 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 13 weeks later is the same day, plus 1 day. So Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday. Therefore, April 3rd is Thursday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Wednesday. Then, January 1st + 31 days is February 1st. Since 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1st is Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday. Wait, that's a different approach. Let me check that.\n\nIf January 1st is Wednesday, then January 8th is Wednesday again. Then January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then January 29th is Wednesday. Then January 30th is Thursday, January 31st is Friday. So February 1st is Saturday. That's correct. So February 1st is Saturday.\n\nNow, February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year). So February 28th is 28 days after February 1st. 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks, so February 28th is also Saturday. Then March 1st is Sunday.\n\nMarch has 31 days. So March 1st is Sunday. March 8th is Sunday, March 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then March 29th is Sunday. March 30th is Monday, March 31st is Tuesday. Then April 1st is Wednesday. April 2nd is Thursday, April 3rd is Friday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. Wait, according to this, April 3rd is Friday. But earlier calculation said Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check again. If February 1st is Saturday, then February 28th is Saturday (since 28 days is 4 weeks). Then March 1st is Sunday. March has 31 days. So March 1st is Sunday. March 1st + 28 days is March 29th, which is Sunday again. Then March 30th is Monday, March 31st is Tuesday. April 1st is Wednesday. April 2nd is Thursday, April 3rd is Friday. So according to this, April 3rd is Friday. But earlier calculation said 92 days later is Thursday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check the number of days again. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 3rd.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1st. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1st. Then April 3rd is 2 days after April 1st. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 + 28 + 31 + 2 = 92 days. So 92 days after January 1st is April 3rd. So 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 13 weeks later is the same day, plus 1 day. So if January 1st is Wednesday, then 92 days later is Wednesday + 1 day = Thursday. But according to the step-by-step month count, April 3rd is Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the step-by-step count. Let me check again.\n\nIf January 1st is Wednesday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 22: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 29: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 5: Wednesday (adding 7 days)\n\nFebruary 12: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 19: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 26: Wednesday\n\nMarch 5: Wednesday\n\nMarch 12: Wednesday\n\nMarch 19: Wednesday\n\nMarch 26: Wednesday\n\nApril 2: Wednesday (adding 7 days to March 26th)\n\nApril 3: Thursday\n\nWait, that's different from the previous step-by-step. Wait, earlier I thought that March 1st is Sunday, but according to this, March 5th is Wednesday. Let me check that again.\n\nIf February 26th is Wednesday, then March 5th is 9 days later. Wait, February 26th is Wednesday. Then March 1st is 5 days later (February 26th + 5 days is March 1st). So March 1st is Wednesday + 5 days = Monday? Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. Wait, maybe I messed up the previous step-by-step.\n\nLet me start over. If January 1st is Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 2: Thursday\n\nJanuary 3: Friday\n\nJanuary 4: Saturday\n\nJanuary 5: Sunday\n\nJanuary 6: Monday\n\nJanuary 7: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (7 days later)\n\nSo January 8 is Wednesday. Then January 15 is Wednesday, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Wednesday (adding 7 days to January 29th). Then February 12, 19, 26 are Wednesdays. Then March 5 is Wednesday (adding 7 days to February 26th). So March 5 is Wednesday. Then March 12 is Wednesday, March 19, March 26. Then April 2 is Wednesday (adding 7 days to March 26th). So April 2 is Wednesday, April 3 is Thursday. So according to this, April 3 is Thursday. But earlier when I thought March 1st was Sunday, that was wrong. So where did that mistake come from?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the previous step-by-step. Let me check again. If February 26th is Wednesday, then March 1st is 5 days later. So February 26 (Wed) + 1 day is Feb 27 (Thu), +2 is Feb 28 (Fri), +3 is March 1 (Sat). Wait, that's different. So March 1st is Saturday, not Sunday. So that's where the mistake was. So March 1st is Saturday. Then March 8th is Saturday, March 15th, 22nd, 29th. March 29th is Saturday. Then March 30th is Sunday, March 31st is Monday. April 1st is Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting again. Wait, if March 1st is Saturday, then March 8th is Saturday, March 15th, 22nd, 29th. So March 29th is Saturday. Then March 30th is Sunday, March 31st is Monday. Then April 1st is Tuesday. Then April 2nd is Wednesday, April 3rd is Thursday. So that's consistent with the first calculation. So April 3rd is Thursday. But earlier when I thought March 1st was Sunday, that was wrong. So the correct answer is Thursday.\n\nBut why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought that March 1st was Sunday, but that was a mistake. So the correct step-by-step is that March 1st is Saturday. Therefore, April 3rd is Thursday.\n\nSo the answer should be Thursday. But let me check again with the total days. 92 days after January 1st (Wednesday) is 92 days. 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 13 weeks later is Wednesday, plus 1 day is Thursday. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Thursday.", "Thursday"], [49, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 10 to Tuesday, June 14, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to calculate the total days and then subtract the weekends. Let me check the dates first. Let me confirm the dates. April 10, 2022 is a Sunday. Then June 14 is a Tuesday. Let me verify that. \n\nWait, I can check the actual calendar. Let me think. April 10, 2022 is a Sunday. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nFirst, from April 10 to April 30. April has 30 days. So from April 10 (Sunday) to April 30 is 21 days (since 30 - 10 = 20 days, plus the start day). Wait, no. If April 10 is day 1, then April 11 is day 2, etc. So from April 10 to April 30 inclusive is 30 - 10 + 1 = 21 days. \n\nNow, April 10 is Sunday. Let's count the number of weekends in April. April 10 is Sunday. Then the next weekend would be April 17 (Sunday), 24 (Sunday), and 31 (but April only has 30 days). So in April, the Sundays are 10, 17, 24, and 31. But 31 is not in April. So three Sundays in April. Then the Saturdays would be the day before each Sunday. So April 9, 16, 23, 30. Wait, April 30 is a Saturday? Let me check. April 10 is Sunday. April 11 is Monday. So April 16 is Saturday (since 10 + 6 days is 16, which is Saturday). Then April 23 is Saturday, and April 30 is Saturday. So that's three Saturdays in April. So total weekends in April would be 3 Sundays + 3 Saturdays = 6 days. \n\nSo from April 10 to April 30, there are 21 days. Subtract the 6 weekend days, that leaves 15 weekdays. Wait, but wait. Wait, April 10 is a Sunday, which is included. So if we count from April 10 to April 30 inclusive, the first day is Sunday (counted as a weekend), and the last day is Saturday (also a weekend). So the total days are 21. The number of weekends would be 3 Sundays and 3 Saturdays. So 6 weekend days. So 21 - 6 = 15 weekdays. \n\nThen, moving on to May. May has 31 days. Let's check how many weekends are in May. May 1, 2022 is a Sunday? Wait, April 10 is Sunday. April 10 + 21 days is May 1, 2022. Wait, April has 30 days, so April 10 + 20 days is May 10? Wait, no. Wait, April 10 is day 1. April 11 is day 2. April 30 is day 21. Then May 1 is day 22. So May 1, 2022 is a Monday. Because April 10 is Sunday, April 11 is Monday. So May 1 is 21 days after April 10. Let me check: April 10 is Sunday. April 11 is Monday. So April 17 is Sunday again. Then April 24 is Sunday, and April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nApril 10 is Sunday. April 11 is Monday. April 12 is Tuesday. April 13 is Wednesday. April 14 is Thursday. April 15 is Friday. April 16 is Saturday. April 17 is Sunday. April 18 is Monday. April 19 is Tuesday. April 20 is Wednesday. April 21 is Thursday. April 22 is Friday. April 23 is Saturday. April 24 is Sunday. April 25 is Monday. April 26 is Tuesday. April 27 is Wednesday. April 28 is Thursday. April 29 is Friday. April 30 is Saturday. So yes, April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, and so on. \n\nSo May has 31 days. Let's count the number of weekends in May. Sundays in May would be May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's five Sundays. Saturdays would be May 7, 14, 21, 28. That's four Saturdays. So total weekends in May are 5 + 4 = 9 days. \n\nSo May has 31 days. So the number of weekdays in May is 31 - 9 = 22 days. \n\nThen June. June 1, 2022 is a Monday. Because May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday. So May 31 is a Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, May has 31 days. May 1 is Sunday. May 2 is Monday. So May 31 is a Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that's correct. So June 1 is Wednesday. \n\nNow, the end date is June 14, which is a Tuesday. So we need to count from June 1 (Wednesday) to June 14 (Tuesday). Let's check how many days that is. June 1 to June 14 inclusive is 14 days. \n\nNow, let's count the weekends in June. The weekends in June would be Saturdays and Sundays. Let's find the first Saturday in June. June 1 is Wednesday. So June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday. So the first Saturday is June 4. Then the next ones are June 11, 18, 25. But June 14 is the end date, so the Saturdays in June up to June 14 are June 4 and 11. Sundays would be June 5, 12. So that's two Saturdays and two Sundays. So total of 4 weekend days in June. \n\nSo the number of weekdays in June from June 1 to June 14 is 14 days total minus 4 weekend days = 10 weekdays. \n\nBut wait, the start date is April 10 (Sunday) and the end date is June 14 (Tuesday). So the total days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is:\n\nApril 10 to April 30: 21 days.\n\nMay: 31 days.\n\nJune 1 to June 14: 14 days.\n\nTotal days: 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days.\n\nBut wait, that's 21 + 31 is 52, plus 14 is 66. So total 66 days. \n\nNow, the number of weekends in this period is the weekends in April (6 days), May (9 days), and June (4 days). So 6 + 9 + 4 = 19 days. \n\nSo the number of weekdays would be 66 - 19 = 47 days. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me recheck each month.\n\nApril: 3 Sundays (10, 17, 24) and 3 Saturdays (9, 16, 23, 30). Wait, April 30 is Saturday. So that's 3 Saturdays. So 3 + 3 = 6. Correct.\n\nMay: 5 Sundays (1, 8, 15, 22, 29) and 4 Saturdays (7, 14, 21, 28). So 5 + 4 = 9. Correct.\n\nJune: 2 Saturdays (4, 11) and 2 Sundays (5, 12). So 4. Correct. \n\nTotal weekends: 6 + 9 + 4 = 19. \n\nTotal days: 66. So 66 - 19 = 47 weekdays. \n\nBut wait, the start date is April 10 (Sunday) and the end date is June 14 (Tuesday). So the total days include both start and end. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by counting the weekdays directly. Let's see. \n\nApril 10 is Sunday. So the first weekday is April 11 (Monday). Then April 12 (Tuesday), 13 (Wednesday), 14 (Thursday), 15 (Friday). Then April 16 (Saturday) is a weekend. So from April 10 to April 30, the weekdays would be:\n\nApril 11-15 (5 days), then April 18-22 (5 days), April 25-29 (5 days). Wait, that's 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 days. Which matches the previous calculation. \n\nThen May has 22 weekdays. Then June has 10 weekdays. 15 + 22 + 10 = 47. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 47.", "47"], [49, "What day of the week was December 20, 2022?

Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So if that's the case, then I can count the days from January 1, 2022 to December 20, 2022.\n\nBut that might take a while. Let me see. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's break it down.\n\nStarting from January 1, 2022 (Saturday), let's count the days until December 20, 2022. But that's a lot of days. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I can use the fact that December 20, 2022 is 20 days into December. Wait, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. If that's correct, then December 20 would be Tuesday. But I need to verify this. Let me think. If I can find a reliable source or a way to cross-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I go back from January 1, 2023, which is Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Because December 31, 2022 is one day before January 1, 2023. So December 31, 2022 is Saturday. Then, December 20, 2022 would be 11 days before December 31. Let's count that. December 31 is Saturday. December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday, 25 is Sunday, 24 is Saturday, 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday, 21 is Wednesday, 20 is Tuesday. So that would make December 20, 2022 a Tuesday. So that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the other method where January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let's count the days from January 1, 2022 to December 20, 2022. Let's see. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 20. Let's add those up.\n\nJanuary: 31 days (from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days, but since we start on Jan 1, which is day 0, maybe I need to adjust. Wait, maybe I should calculate the total number of days from January 1, 2022 to December 20, 2022. Let's do that step by step.\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober: 31\nNovember: 30\nDecember: 20\n\nAdding those up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n+31 (Mar) = 90\n+30 (Apr) = 120\n+31 (May) = 151\n+30 (Jun) = 181\n+31 (Jul) = 212\n+31 (Aug) = 243\n+30 (Sep) = 273\n+31 (Oct) = 304\n+30 (Nov) = 334\n+20 (Dec) = 354 days.\n\nSo from January 1, 2022 to December 20, 2022 is 354 days. Now, since January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, we can calculate the day of the week by finding 354 mod 7. Because 7 days a week.\n\n354 divided by 7 is 50 weeks and 4 days. Because 50*7=350, 354-350=4. So 4 days after Saturday. Saturday + 1 day is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday. Wait, that would mean December 20, 2022 is a Wednesday? But that contradicts the previous conclusion of Tuesday. So there's a problem here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in adding the days.\n\nLet me recount the days from January 1 to December 20, 2022.\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total so far: 31+28=59)\nMarch: 31 (59+31=90)\nApril: 30 (90+30=120)\nMay: 31 (120+31=151)\nJune: 30 (151+30=181)\nJuly: 31 (181+31=212)\nAugust: 31 (212+31=243)\nSeptember: 30 (243+30=273)\nOctober: 31 (273+31=304)\nNovember: 30 (304+30=334)\nDecember: 20 (334+20=354). So that's correct. 354 days.\n\nNow, 354 divided by 7 is 50 weeks and 4 days. So 354 mod 7 is 4. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 4 days would be Saturday + 4 days = Wednesday. But earlier, when I counted backwards from December 31, 2022 (Saturday), I got December 20 as Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first method. Let me check that again. If December 31, 2022 is Saturday, then December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday, 25 is Sunday, 24 is Saturday, 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday, 21 is Wednesday, 20 is Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday. But according to the other method, it's Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. Wait, I think I might have confused the years. Let me check. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I go back one year, 2022, then since 2022 is not a leap year, the day of the week shifts by one day. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 started on Saturday. Because 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So the next year starts one day later. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. That seems correct.\n\nBut then why is there a discrepancy between the two methods? Let me check the second method again. If December 31, 2022 is Saturday, then December 20 is 11 days before that. Let's count 11 days back from Saturday. Let's count:\n\nDecember 31: Saturday (day 0)\nDecember 30: Friday (1)\nDecember 29: Thursday (2)\nDecember 28: Wednesday (3)\nDecember 27: Tuesday (4)\nDecember 26: Monday (5)\nDecember 25: Sunday (6)\nDecember 24: Saturday (7)\nDecember 23: Friday (8)\nDecember 22: Thursday (9)\nDecember 21: Wednesday (10)\nDecember 20: Tuesday (11)\n\nSo that's 11 days back, which is Tuesday. So that would mean December 20 is Tuesday. But according to the other method, it's Wednesday. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first method. Let me check the total days again. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, and December 20, 2022 is 354 days later, then 354 mod 7 is 4. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. But according to the other method, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when I count the days from January 1 to December 20, I need to check if I'm including or excluding the starting day. For example, if January 1 is day 0, then adding 354 days would take me to December 20. But if I count the number of days between January 1 and December 20, inclusive, that would be 354 days. But when calculating the day of the week, if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 354 days would be 354 days later. But since 354 divided by 7 is 50 weeks and 4 days, that would mean that December 20 is 4 days after Saturday, which is Wednesday. But according to the other method, it's Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the methods must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first method. Let me check the number of days between January 1, 2022 and December 20, 2022 again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 20. Let me add them again:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\nOctober: 31 (304)\nNovember: 30 (334)\nDecember: 20 (354). So that's correct. 354 days.\n\nBut if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 354 days would be 354 mod 7 = 4. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. But according to the other method, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that December 31, 2022 is Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then December 31, 2022 is Saturday. That's correct because 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So December 31, 2022 is one day before January 1, 2023, which is Sunday. So December 31, 2022 is Saturday. That seems correct.\n\nSo if December 31 is Saturday, then December 20 is 11 days before that. Let's count again:\n\nDecember 31: Saturday (0)\nDecember 30: Friday (1)\nDecember 29: Thursday (2)\nDecember 28: Wednesday (3)\nDecember 27: Tuesday (4)\nDecember 26: Monday (5)\nDecember 25: Sunday (6)\nDecember 24: Saturday (7)\nDecember 23: Friday (8)\nDecember 22: Thursday (9)\nDecember 21: Wednesday (10)\nDecember 20: Tuesday (11)\n\nSo that's 11 days back, which is Tuesday. So that would mean December 20 is Tuesday. But according to the other method, it's Wednesday. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, one of the methods must be wrong. But which one?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first method. Let me check the day of the week for a known date. For example, I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. If that's the case, then December 20 would be Tuesday. So that would align with the second method. But according to the first method, it's Wednesday. So that suggests that the first method is wrong. Therefore, the error must be in the first method.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when I calculated the number of days between January 1, 2022 and December 20, 2022, I included both start and end dates? Or maybe not. Let me think. If I start on January 1, 2022 (day 0), then adding 354 days would take me to December 20, 2022. But if I count the days between January 1 and December 20, inclusive, that would be 354 days. However, when calculating the day of the week, if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 354 days would be 354 days later. But since 354 divided by 7 is 50 weeks and 4 days, that would mean that December 20 is 4 days after Saturday, which is Wednesday. But according to the other method, it's Tuesday. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Let me look up the actual day of the week for January 1, 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but I can use another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I go back one year, 2022, which is not a leap year, so the day of the week shifts by one day. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 started on Saturday. That seems correct. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday.\n\nBut then why is there a conflict? Let me check another date. For example, let's take December 21, 2022. If December 20 is Tuesday, then December 21 is Wednesday. Which matches the earlier assumption. So that seems correct. So if December 21 is Wednesday, then December 20 is Tuesday. So that would mean that the first method is wrong. Therefore, the error must be in the first method's calculation of the number of days between January 1, 2022 and December 20, 2022.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to December 20, 2022.\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober: 31\nNovember: 30\nDecember: 20\n\nAdding them up:\n\n31 + 28 = 59\n+31 = 90\n+30 = 120\n+31 = 151\n+30 = 181\n+31 = 212\n+31 = 243\n+30 = 273\n+31 = 304\n+30 = 334\n+20 = 354. So that's correct. 354 days.\n\nBut if January 1 is Saturday, then"], [49, "Is 2014 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2014 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2014. First, divide 2014 by 4. Let me do the division: 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2014 minus 2000 is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3.5. So 2014 divided by 4 is 503.5. That means 2014 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that calculation. Let me add 4 to 2012, which is a leap year. 2012 + 4 is 2016, so 2014 is two years after 2012, so it's not a leap year. Yeah, that makes sense. So since 2014 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [49, "In a year where Sunday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 11. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the weekday of April 11th in a year where January 1st is a Sunday. I need to figure out what day of the week that date falls on.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of days between January 1st and April 11th. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year unless stated otherwise. So February has 28 days. March has 31 days. Then April 11th is the 11th day of April.\n\nSo adding up the days: January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days. Then February is 28 days, March is 31 days, and then April 11th is 11 days. Wait, but I need to count the days from January 1st to April 11th inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, the problem says January 1st is a Sunday. So if I want to find April 11th, I need to count how many days are between January 1st and April 11th, then find the weekday.\n\nWait, let's think again. If January 1st is Sunday, then January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1 (Monday), and so on. So to find April 11th, I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1st to April 11th, then take that number modulo 7 to find the weekday.\n\nSo let's calculate the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, March has 31 days, and April 11th is 11 days. So total days from January 1st to April 11th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 11 is 100 days. Wait, but that would be 100 days after January 1st. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, so adding 100 days would take us to day 100. But how does that translate to the weekday?\n\nSince each week has 7 days, 100 divided by 7 gives a remainder. Let's calculate 100 divided by 7. 7*14 is 98, so 100 - 98 is 2. So the remainder is 2. That means 100 days after Sunday is 2 days later. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is Sunday, then adding 1 day is Monday (day 1), adding 2 days is Tuesday (day 2). So if April 11th is day 100, then it's 2 days after Sunday, which is Tuesday. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again. From January 1st to April 11th: January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February is 28 days, March is 31 days, and April 11th is 11 days. So total days is 30 + 28 + 31 + 11? Wait, no. Wait, if I'm counting from January 1st to April 11th, inclusive, then the total days would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 11 is 101 days. But that would be if you include both the start and end dates. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then the next day is day 1. So the number of days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days. Because from January 1st to April 11th is 31 (Jan) - 1 (since Jan 1 is day 0) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 30 + 28 + 31 + 11 = 100 days. Wait, that's correct. Because from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since Jan 1 is day 0, Jan 2 is day 1, ..., Jan 31 is day 30). Then February has 28 days (days 31 to 58), March has 31 days (days 59 to 89), and April 11th is day 90 (March 31 is day 89, so April 1 is day 90, April 11 is day 100). Wait, that's 100 days. So 100 days after January 1st (Sunday) is April 11th. Then 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Therefore, April 11th is a Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Sunday. Let's count the days for each month. January has 31 days, so January 1st is Sunday. Then January 8th is Sunday again (7 days later). January 15th, 22nd, 29th are Sundays. Then February 5th is Sunday (since January 29th is Sunday, adding 7 days is February 5th). Then February 12th, 19th, 26th are Sundays. March 5th is Sunday, 12th, 19th, 26th, and April 2nd is Sunday. Then April 9th is Sunday. So April 9th is Sunday. Then April 10th is Monday, April 11th is Tuesday. So that's consistent with the previous calculation. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [49, "Between Tuesday, January 25, 2022 and Tuesday, March 29, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, January 25, 2022, and Tuesday, March 29, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) that fall within that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me check the dates. January 25 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think January 25, 2022 was a Tuesday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can count the days or use a calendar. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down month by month. Let's see:\n\nFrom January 25 to January 31: January has 31 days. So from January 25 (Tuesday) to January 31 is 7 days. Wait, January 25 is Tuesday, then January 26 is Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So that's 7 days. So from Jan 25 to Jan 31 inclusive is 7 days. But wait, if I include both start and end dates, then that's correct. So in that period, how many business days? Let's count:\n\nJan 25 (Tue) is a business day. Then 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri) \u2013 those are 3 business days. Then 29 (Sat) is a weekend, 30 (Sun) weekend, 31 (Mon) business. So in January, from 25 to 31, there are 4 business days (25, 26, 27, 28, 31? Wait, wait. Wait, 25 is Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So from 25 to 31 inclusive, that's 7 days. The business days are 25, 26, 27, 28, 31. That's 5 business days. Wait, because 29 and 30 are weekends. So 5 business days in January.\n\nThen February 2022. February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. So February 1 is a Tuesday (since January 31 is a Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday). Wait, let me check that. If January 31 is a Monday, then February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. So February has 28 days. Let's count the business days in February. Since February 1 is Tuesday, the last day of February is February 28, which is a Monday (since 28 days later, 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks, so same day of the week as February 1, which is Tuesday. Wait, no. Wait, if February 1 is Tuesday, then February 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. But February only has 28 days, so February 28 is a Monday. Wait, 28 days is 4 weeks. So February 1 is Tuesday, then February 28 is also Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, 28 days is exactly 4 weeks. So if February 1 is Tuesday, then February 28 is also Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean that February 28 is a Tuesday. But that can't be right because if February 1 is Tuesday, then adding 7 days (February 8) is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. But 29 is beyond February. So February 28 is 27 days after February 1. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So February 1 + 6 days is February 7, which is Monday. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check an actual calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to calculate it properly. Let's take January 31, 2022, which is a Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, 8 Tuesday, etc. So February 28 is the last day. Let's count how many days are in February. 28 days. So 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks. So February 1 is Tuesday, and February 28 is also Tuesday. Wait, that can't be. Because 28 days later would be the same day of the week. So if February 1 is Tuesday, then February 28 is also Tuesday. But that would mean that February 28 is a Tuesday. But that would mean that February 29 is a Wednesday, but 2022 is not a leap year. So February 28 is the last day. So in February, the days are from Tuesday (Feb 1) to Tuesday (Feb 28). So how many business days are there in February?\n\nWell, each week has 5 business days. Since there are 4 weeks in February, that's 4 * 5 = 20 business days. But wait, if February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks, then yes, each week has 5 business days. So 4 weeks would be 20 business days. So February has 20 business days.\n\nThen March 2022. March 1 is a Wednesday (since February 28 is a Tuesday, so March 1 is Wednesday). March has 31 days. So March 1 is Wednesday, March 2 is Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday, 7 Tuesday, etc. The end date is March 29, which is a Tuesday. Let's check how many days are in March from March 1 to March 29. That's 29 days. Let's break that down into weeks. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day. So 4 weeks is 28 days, plus 1 day. So March 1 to March 28 is 4 weeks, which is 20 business days (since 4 weeks * 5 business days per week). Then March 29 is the next day, which is a Tuesday. So that's another business day. So total business days in March would be 20 + 1 = 21.\n\nWait, but let me check again. March 1 is Wednesday. So March 1 (Wed), 2 (Thu), 3 (Fri), 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun), 6 (Mon), 7 (Tue), 8 (Wed), etc. So each week has 5 business days. So from March 1 to March 28 is 28 days, which is 4 weeks. So 4 * 5 = 20 business days. Then March 29 is a Tuesday, which is a business day. So that's 21 business days in March.\n\nSo adding up the business days:\n\nJanuary: 5 days\n\nFebruary: 20 days\n\nMarch: 21 days\n\nTotal: 5 + 20 + 21 = 46 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the January count. Let me recheck January.\n\nJanuary 25 is Tuesday. January 25 (Tue), 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri), 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon). So from Jan 25 to Jan 31 inclusive is 7 days. The business days are 25, 26, 27, 28, 31. That's 5 days. Correct.\n\nFebruary has 28 days, 4 weeks, 20 business days. Correct.\n\nMarch has 29 days. March 1 is Wednesday. So March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. Let's count the business days. Let's see:\n\nMarch 1 (Wed) to March 28 (Tue) is 28 days, which is 4 weeks. So 20 business days. Then March 29 is a Tuesday, which is a business day. So 20 + 1 = 21. Correct.\n\nSo total is 5 + 20 + 21 = 46. So the answer should be 46.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. Let me try that approach to verify.\n\nThe start date is Jan 25, 2022 (Tuesday), end date is March 29, 2022 (Tuesday). Let's calculate the total number of days between them inclusive.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days from Jan 25 to March 29.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from Jan 25 to Jan 31 is 7 days (including both dates). Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days is 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days.\n\nWait, but that's 7 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 29 (Mar) = 64 days. So total days between Jan 25 and March 29 inclusive is 64 days.\n\nNow, how many weekends are in those 64 days? Let's calculate the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nSince the start date is a Tuesday, let's see the days of the week.\n\nJan 25 is Tuesday. Then the next day is Wednesday, etc. Let's see how many weekends are in the period.\n\nEach week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). So if there are 64 days, that's 64 / 7 = 9 weeks and 1 day. So 9 weeks is 63 days, plus 1 day (Tuesday). So the total number of weekends would be 9 weeks * 2 = 18 weekend days, plus any additional weekend days in the remaining 1 day. Since the remaining day is Tuesday, which is a business day, there are no additional weekend days. So total weekends are 18. Therefore, business days would be 64 - 18 = 46. Which matches the previous calculation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 46.", "46"], [49, "If a meeting is scheduled on the last Saturday of December 2022, on which day of the month does it occur? Give the count numerically. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the date of the last Saturday in December 2022. I need to figure out which Saturday that is.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then counting the days:\n\nDecember 1: Thursday\nDecember 2: Friday\nDecember 3: Saturday. So the first Saturday is the 3rd. Then the next Saturdays would be the 10th, 17th, and 24th. The next one after that would be the 31st. Wait, December has 31 days. So the last Saturday would be the 31st? Let me check again.\n\nWait, if December 3 is a Saturday, then adding 7 days each time. 3 + 7 = 10 (Saturday), 10 +7=17, 17+7=24, 24+7=31. So December 31st would be a Saturday. But wait, does that make sense? Let me check another way. Maybe I can look up the actual calendar for December 2022. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my knowledge.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. So December 3 is Saturday. Then December 31 is 28 days later. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so adding 28 days to December 3 would be December 3 + 28 days = December 31. So that would be the same day of the week, Saturday. Therefore, December 31, 2022, is a Saturday. Therefore, the last Saturday in December 2022 is the 31st. So the answer should be 31. But wait, I need to make sure that December 31 is indeed a Saturday. Let me check again. If December 1 is Thursday, then December 7 is also Thursday. Then December 14, 21, 28. December 28 is a Thursday. Then December 29 is Friday, 30 is Saturday, 31 is Sunday. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, what's going on here?\n\nWait, if December 1 is Thursday, then December 3 is Saturday. Then December 10 is Saturday (adding 7 days). Then December 17, 24, and 31. Wait, December 24 is Saturday.

But earlier when I thought December 28 was Thursday, that's correct. So December 31 is Saturday. Therefore, the last Saturday is the 31st. So the answer is 31. But I need to make sure that December 31 is indeed a Saturday. Let me check again. If December 1 is Thursday, then December 3 is Saturday. Then adding 28 days (4 weeks) would be December 3 + 28 = December 31. So that's the same day of the week. Therefore, December 31 is Saturday. So the answer is 31.

Write out the full weekday name.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week November 15, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to go back to 2022. Let me check. Wait, maybe I should use a reference date that I know. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, no, maybe I should check another date. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I can figure out how many days are between November 15, 2022 and January 1, 2023, I can count backward.\n\nBut maybe that's complicated. Alternatively, I can use a known date in 2022. Let's see. For example, I remember that November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If November 1 is Tuesday, then adding days: November 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue). Wait, that would make November 15 a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if November 1 was actually a Tuesday. Maybe I should verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, but how do I get there? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I can find out what day of the week January 1, 2022 was, then I can work from there. Wait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Monday. Wait, but I thought January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have mixed up the years. Let me try to recall. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days, so 2021 would start on a Thursday. Then 2022 would start on a Friday. Wait, but that would mean January 1, 2022 was a Friday. Then January 1, 2023 would be a Saturday. But I thought earlier that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me check this again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a known date. Wait, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think. If I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. July 4, 2022: if I count from July 4, 2022, then July 4 is Monday. Then July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. August 1 is Monday. Then August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. September 5 is Monday. September 12 is Monday. September 19 is Monday. September 26 is Monday. October 3 is Monday. October 10 is Monday. October 17 is Monday. October 24 is Monday. October 31 is Monday. November 7 is Monday. November 14 is Monday. November 15 would be Tuesday. So that would make November 15, 2022 a Tuesday. But wait, if July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is a Friday. Let me check that. July 4 is Monday. July 1 is 3 days before, so July 1 is Friday. Then July 1 is Friday. Then July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. August 5 is Friday. August 12 is Friday. August 19 is Friday. August 26 is Friday. September 2 is Friday. September 9 is Friday. September 16 is Friday. September 23 is Friday. September 30 is Friday. October 7 is Friday. October 14 is Friday. October 21 is Friday. October 28 is Friday. November 4 is Friday. November 11 is Friday. November 15 is Tuesday? Wait, November 11 is Friday, then November 12 is Saturday, 13 Sunday, 14 Monday, 15 Tuesday. Yes, that would make November 15 a Tuesday. So according to that, the answer is Tuesday. But I need to make sure that July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Because if that's correct, then the rest follows. Alternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that November 15, 2022 was a Tuesday. But I need to confirm this. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If November 15 is Tuesday, then November 15 + 16 days is December 1. Let's count: November 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), December 1 (Thu). Wait, that would make December 1 a Thursday. Then December 8 is Thursday, 15 is Thursday, 22 is Thursday, 29 is Thursday. Then December 21 would be Wednesday. Wait, December 21 is 21-15=6 days after November 15. So November 15 is Tuesday, then November 16 is Wednesday, 17 Thursday, 18 Friday, 19 Saturday, 20 Sunday, 21 Monday. Then December 1 is Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recount. If November 15 is Tuesday, then November 16 is Wednesday, 17 Thursday, 18 Friday, 19 Saturday, 20 Sunday, 21 Monday. Then November 22 is Tuesday, 23 Wednesday, 24 Thursday, 25 Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday, December 1 is Thursday. So December 1 is Thursday. Then December 8 is Thursday, 15 is Thursday, 22 is Thursday, 29 is Thursday. Then December 21 would be 21-15=6 days after November 15. Wait, November 15 is Tuesday, so adding 6 days: Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. Wait, that would make December 21 a Monday. But I thought earlier that December 21 was a Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. That means my initial assumption that November 15 is Tuesday is wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nEarlier, I thought that July 4 was a Monday. Let me check that again. If July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Friday. Then July 8 is Friday, 15 is Friday, 22 is Friday, 29 is Friday. August 5 is Friday, 12 is Friday, 19 is Friday, 26 is Friday. September 2 is Friday, 9 is Friday, 16 is Friday, 23 is Friday, 30 is Friday. October 7 is Friday, 14 is Friday, 21 is Friday, 28 is Friday. November 4 is Friday, 11 is Friday, 18 is Friday, 25 is Friday. December 2 is Friday, 9 is Friday, 16 is Friday, 23 is Friday, 30 is Friday. So December 21 would be 21-16=5 days after December 16, which is Friday. So December 21 would be Friday + 5 days = Wednesday. Wait, that would make December 21 a Wednesday. But according to the previous calculation, if November 15 is Tuesday, then December 21 would be Monday. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, my assumption that July 4 is a Monday must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let me try to find the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Monday (since 2022 is not a leap year, 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day). So January 1, 2023 is Monday. But I thought earlier that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So maybe I was wrong. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is Sunday, then January 1, 2023 is Monday. Then, for example, July 4, 2022 would be 183 days after January 1, 2022. Let's calculate that. January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 4. So from January 1 to July 4 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 4 (Jul) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +4=185 days. So July 4 is 185 days after January 1, 2022. Now, 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then July 4 is Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. So July 4, 2022 would be a Wednesday. But earlier I thought it was a Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my previous assumption that July 4 was a Monday was wrong. So now, if July 4 is Wednesday, then July 1 is 3 days before, so July 1 is Sunday. Then July 8 is Sunday, 15 is Sunday, 22 is Sunday, 29 is Sunday. August 5 is Sunday, 12 is Sunday, 19 is Sunday, 26 is Sunday. September 2 is Sunday, 9 is Sunday, 16 is Sunday, 23 is Sunday, 30 is Sunday. October 7 is Sunday, 14 is Sunday, 21 is Sunday, 28 is Sunday. November 4 is Sunday, 11 is Sunday, 18 is Sunday, 25 is Sunday. December 2 is Sunday, 9 is Sunday, 16 is Sunday, 23 is Sunday, 30 is Sunday. So December 21 would be 21-16=5 days after December 16, which is Sunday. So December 21 is Sunday + 5 days = Friday. But earlier I thought that December 21 was a Wednesday. So this is conflicting again. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1, 2022 is Sunday, then July 4 is 185 days later. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So July 4 is Wednesday. Then July 1 is Sunday. Then July 8 is Sunday, 15 is Sunday, 22 is Sunday, 29 is Sunday. August 5 is Sunday. Then August 12 is Sunday, 19 is Sunday, 26 is Sunday. September 2 is Sunday, 9 is Sunday, 16 is Sunday, 23 is Sunday, 30 is Sunday. October 7 is Sunday, 14 is Sunday, 21 is Sunday, 28 is Sunday. November 4 is Sunday, 11 is Sunday, 18 is Sunday, 25 is Sunday. December 2 is Sunday, 9 is Sunday, 16 is Sunday, 23 is Sunday, 30 is Sunday. So December 21 is 21-16=5 days after December 16 (Sunday). So 5 days later is Friday. So December 21 is Friday. But I thought earlier that December 21 was Wednesday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my previous assumption. So if December 21 is Friday, then November 15 would be how many days before that? Let's calculate. November 15 to December 21 is 16 days (November 15 to 30 is 16 days, then December 1 to 21 is 21 days, but that's not right. Wait, November 15 to November 30 is 15 days (since 30-15=15). Then December 1 to December 21 is 21 days. So total is 15+21=36 days. Wait, but that's 36 days. 36 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 1 day. So if December 21 is Friday, then November 15 would be Friday minus 1 day, which is Thursday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where July 4 was Wednesday, leading to November 15 being Thursday. But earlier I thought that November 15 was Tuesday. So now I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then, let's count the days from January 1 to November 15. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 15. So total days from January 1 to November 15 is:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober: 31\nNovember: 15\n\nAdding these up:\n\n31 + 28 = 59\n59 + 31 = 90\n90 + 30 = 120\n120 + 31 = 151\n151 + 30 = 181\n181 + 31 = 212\n212 + 31 = 243\n243 + 30 = 273\n273 + 31 = 304\n304 + 15 = 319 days.\n\nSo November 15 is 319 days after January 1, 2022. Now, 319 divided by 7 is 45 weeks and 4 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then 45 weeks later is also Sunday, and adding 4 days would make it Thursday. So November 15, 2022 would be a Thursday. But this contradicts the previous calculation where July 4 was Wednesday, leading to November 15 being Thursday. Wait, but earlier when I thought July 4 was Wednesday, then November 15 was Thursday. So that seems consistent. But earlier when I thought July 4 was Monday, I had conflicting results. So maybe the correct answer is Thursday? But I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if November 15 is Thursday, then December 21 is 16 days later (November 15 to November 30 is 16 days, then December 1 to 21 is 21 days, total 37 days). Wait, 37 days is 5 weeks and 2 days.

Provide the full name of the weekday.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what day of the week it was 58 days ago, given that today is Friday, March 11, 2022. I need to figure out the day by counting back 58 days from today.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 58 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days that is. Let me do that calculation. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks with a remainder. 7 times 8 is 56, so 58 minus 56 is 2. So that means 58 days ago is the same as 8 weeks and 2 days ago. Since 8 weeks is exactly 56 days, subtracting that from 58 leaves 2 days. So I need to go back 2 days from Friday.\n\nWait, but wait. If today is Friday, then going back one day would be Thursday, and two days ago would be Wednesday. So 58 days ago would be Wednesday? But wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the days? Wait, March 11, 2022 is a Friday. Let me confirm that. But the problem says today is Friday, March 11, 2022, so I can take that as given. So if I subtract 58 days, which is 8 weeks and 2 days, then subtracting 2 days from Friday would be Wednesday. But maybe I should check by counting backwards step by step to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the date 58 days before March 11, 2022. Let's count backwards. March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 58 days. Let's break it down. Let's subtract days step by step. Starting from March 11, 2022. Let's go back 58 days.\n\nFirst, subtract 56 days (which is 8 weeks) to get to March 11 minus 56 days. That would be March 11 minus 56 days. Let's calculate that. March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 56 days. Let's subtract 31 days first. March 11 minus 31 days would be February 11, 2022. Then subtract another 25 days (since 56-31=25). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 56 days is 8 weeks, so subtracting 56 days from March 11 would be March 11 minus 56 days. Let me think of it as going back 56 days. Since March has 31 days, going back 31 days from March 11 would be February 11. Then going back another 25 days (since 56-31=25). Wait, but 25 days before February 11? Wait, February 11 minus 25 days. Let's count that. February has 28 days in 2022 (since 2022 is not a leap year). So February 11 minus 25 days would be January 17, 2022. Wait, because February 11 minus 11 days is January 31, then minus another 14 days would be January 17. So that would be January 17, 2022. But that's 56 days before March 11. Then adding the remaining 2 days (since 58-56=2) would be January 17 minus 2 days, which is January 15, 2022. Wait, but that seems conflicting with the previous conclusion. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's check the actual date 58 days before March 11, 2022. Let me use a calendar or a date calculator method. But since I can't actually look it up, I need to calculate it manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Since 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 2 days. So 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday. So Friday minus 2 days is Wednesday. But if that's correct, then the answer is Wednesday. However, when I tried to count the dates, I ended up with January 15, 2022. Let me check what day of the week January 15, 2022 was. Wait, but I don't remember that. However, if March 11 is a Friday, then I can work backwards. Let's check.\n\nMarch 11, 2022 is a Friday. Let's check what day was January 15, 2022. Let's count the days between January 15 and March 11. January has 31 days, so from January 15 to January 31 is 16 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. So total days from January 15 to March 11 is 16 + 28 + 11 = 55 days. Wait, but that's 55 days. So if March 11 is 55 days after January 15, then 55 days later is March 11. So 58 days before March 11 would be 55 days before plus 3 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 15 is 55 days before March 11, then 58 days before March 11 would be 55 + 3 = 58 days before? Wait, no. Wait, if January 15 is 55 days before March 11, then 58 days before March 11 would be 55 days before plus 3 days before? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIf I want to find the date 58 days before March 11, 2022, I can subtract 58 days from March 11. Let's do that step by step. March 11 minus 58 days. Let's subtract 31 days to get to February 11 (since March has 31 days). Then subtract another 28 days (February 2022 has 28 days) to get to January 11, 2022. Then subtract another 28 days (January has 31 days, so 28 days before January 11 would be December 11, 2021? Wait, no. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should break it down differently.\n\nAlternatively, since 58 days is 8 weeks and 2 days, then 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday. So that would be Wednesday. But if I check the actual date, maybe that's correct. However, when I tried to count the days between January 15 and March 11, I found that January 15 is 55 days before March 11. So 55 days before March 11 is January 15. Then 58 days before March 11 would be 55 + 3 = 58 days before? Wait, no. Wait, if January 15 is 55 days before March 11, then 58 days before March 11 would be 55 days before minus 3 days? Wait, no. Let me think again. If I have a date X that is 55 days before March 11, then 58 days before March 11 would be 55 days before minus 3 days. So that would be 3 days before January 15. So January 15 minus 3 days is January 12. So that would be January 12, 2022. But then, if that's the case, what day of the week was January 12, 2022?\n\nBut I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let's check the day of the week for March 11, 2022. The problem says it's a Friday. Let's check what day of the week January 12, 2022 was. If I can figure that out, then I can confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. Wait, I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So if that's the case, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 1 + 11 days is January 12. 11 days later would be January 12. Since 7 days later is the same day, so January 1 (Saturday) + 7 days is January 8 (Saturday), then January 15 (Saturday), then January 12 would be 15 - 3 = 12, so 3 days before Saturday is Wednesday. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, and January 12 is 3 days before January 15, which would be Wednesday. So January 12, 2022 was a Wednesday. Then if 58 days before March 11 is January 12, 2022, then that would be Wednesday. Which matches the earlier calculation of 2 days before Friday (Wednesday). So that seems to confirm that the answer is Wednesday.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I tried to count the days between January 15 and March 11, I found that January 15 is 55 days before March 11. So 55 days before March 11 is January 15. Then 58 days before March 11 would be 55 + 3 = 58 days before? Wait, no. Wait, if January 15 is 55 days before March 11, then 58 days before March 11 would be 55 days before minus 3 days. So that would be 3 days before January 15. Which is January 12. So that's correct. So January 12 is 58 days before March 11. And since January 12 is a Wednesday, that's the answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Wednesday.", "Wednesday"], [49, "Name the day of the week for 10/16/2022. Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 16, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If I recall correctly, 2022 started on a Sunday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Let me check. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me try to recall. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2021 started on a Thursday, 2022 started on a Friday? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I should use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is a specific date. Maybe I can check online? But since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my memory or calculations. Let me try to use the fact that I know some dates. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should use the fact that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, I think I'm confusing with another date. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to verify. Let me think of another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 4, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if I can figure out the day of the week for a date I know, then I can work backwards.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I can figure out how many days are between October 16, 2022 and January 1, 2023, then I can subtract that number of days and find the day of the week.\n\nLet me calculate the number of days from October 16, 2022 to January 1, 2023. October has 31 days, so from October 16 to October 31 is 31 - 16 = 15 days. Then November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So total days from October 16 to December 31, 2022 is 15 + 30 + 31 = 76 days. Then January 1, 2023 is one day after December 31, 2022. So total days from October 16 to January 1 is 76 + 1 = 77 days. Wait, but if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then October 16, 2022 would be 77 days before that. Since each week has 7 days, 77 divided by 7 is 11 weeks exactly. So 77 days is 11 weeks. Therefore, October 16, 2022 would be the same day as January 1, 2023, which is Sunday. Wait, but that would mean October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, but if I add 77 days to October 16, 2022, I should get January 1, 2023. So if October 16 is Sunday, then adding 7 days would be Sunday again. So 77 days is 11 weeks, so same day. Therefore, October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. But I need to check if my calculation of the days is correct.\n\nWait, let me check again. From October 16 to October 31: 31 - 16 = 15 days. Then November has 30 days, December has 31 days. So 15 + 30 + 31 = 76 days. Then January 1 is one day after December 31. So total days from October 16 to January 1 is 76 + 1 = 77 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then October 16 is 77 days before. Since 77 divided by 7 is 11, so 11 weeks. Therefore, same day. So October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but I think I might be mixing up the years. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days and count backward from a known date.\n\nLet me try this. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, July 1, 2022: if July 1, 2022 was a Friday, then July 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Fridays. Then August 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Fridays. So August 5, 2022 was a Friday. Then September 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 would be Fridays. So September 23, 2022 was a Friday. Then October 21, 28 would be Fridays. So October 28, 2022 was a Friday. Then November 4, 11, 18, 25 would be Fridays. So November 25, 2022 was a Friday. Then November 25 is Friday, so November 26 is Saturday, 27 is Sunday, 28 is Monday. Wait, that would make November 28, 2022 a Monday. But I need to confirm if my assumption that July 1, 2022 was a Friday is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then January 8, 15, 22, 29 were Sundays. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26 were Sundays. March 4, 11, 18, 25 were Sundays. April 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 were Sundays. May 7, 14, 21, 28 were Sundays. June 4, 11, 18, 25 were Sundays. July 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 were Sundays. August 6, 13, 20, 27 were Sundays. September 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 were Sundays. October 8, 15, 22, 29 were Sundays. November 5, 12, 19, 26 were Sundays. December 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 were Sundays.\n\nWait, so November 5, 2022 was a Sunday. Then November 6 is Monday, 7 Tuesday, 8 Wednesday, 9 Thursday, 10 Friday, 11 Saturday, 12 Sunday, 13 Monday, 14 Tuesday, 15 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 17 Friday, 18 Saturday, 19 Sunday, 20 Monday, 21 Tuesday, 22 Wednesday, 23 Thursday, 24 Friday, 25 Saturday, 26 Sunday, 27 Monday, 28 Tuesday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if November 5 is Sunday, then November 5 is Sunday. Then November 6 is Monday. So November 28 would be 23 days later. Let me count the days from November 5 to November 28. November has 30 days, so from the 5th to the 28th is 23 days. 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Sunday would be Tuesday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous conclusion. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check again. If November 5, 2022 was a Sunday, then November 5 is Sunday.

If January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. February 5, 12, 19, 26. March 4, 11, 18, 25. April 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. May 7, 14, 21, 28.

But earlier when I thought that November 25 was Friday, then adding 3 days would be Monday. That suggests that there's a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check November 25. If November 5 is Sunday, then November 12 is Sunday, 19 is Sunday, 26 is Sunday. So November 26 is Sunday. Then November 25 is Saturday. So November 25 is Saturday. Then November 26 is Sunday, 27 is Monday, 28 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So November 28 is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.

So the correct answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [49, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, August 14, 2022 to Sunday, October 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Write the total number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, August 14, 2022, to Sunday, October 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by breaking it down into months and checking each week.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. August 14 is a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Wait, August 14, 2022: I think that was a Sunday. Let me check. Well, maybe I can count the days. But maybe I should just proceed step by step.\n\nSo the period starts on August 14 (Sunday) and ends on October 16 (Sunday). Let me break this into parts: August, September, and October.\n\nFirst, August. From August 14 to August 31. Let's count how many days that is. August 14 is the start. August has 31 days. So from August 14 to August 31 inclusive is 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days. Wait, 31 minus 14 is 17, plus 1 is 18 days. But since August 14 is a Sunday, let's check the days in August.\n\nAugust 14 (Sunday), 15 (Monday), 16 (Tuesday), 17 (Wednesday), 18 (Thursday), 19 (Friday), 20 (Saturday), 21 (Sunday), 22 (Monday), 23 (Tuesday), 24 (Wednesday), 25 (Thursday), 26 (Friday), 27 (Saturday), 28 (Sunday), 29 (Monday), 30 (Tuesday), 31 (Wednesday). Wait, that's 18 days. Let me count the business days in August.\n\nFrom August 14 to August 31. Let's list the days:\n\nAugust 14: Sunday (not business)\n15: Monday (business)\n16: Tuesday (business)\n17: Wednesday (business)\n18: Thursday (business)\n19: Friday (business)\n20: Saturday (not)\n21: Sunday (not)\n22: Monday (business)\n23: Tuesday (business)\n24: Wednesday (business)\n25: Thursday (business)\n26: Friday (business)\n27: Saturday (not)\n28: Sunday (not)\n29: Monday (business)\n30: Tuesday (business)\n31: Wednesday (business)\n\nSo in August, the business days are 15-19 (5 days), 22-26 (5 days), 29-31 (3 days). Total 5+5+3=13 business days in August.\n\nWait, let me check again. From August 14 to August 31:\n\nWeek 1: 14 (Sun), 15-19 (Mon-Fri) = 5 business days.\n\nWeek 2: 20 (Sat), 21 (Sun), 22-26 (Mon-Fri) = 5 business days.\n\nWeek 3: 27 (Sat), 28 (Sun), 29-31 (Mon-Wed) = 3 business days.\n\nTotal 5+5+3=13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow September. September has 30 days. Let's check how many business days there are in September. Since the period starts on August 31 (Wednesday) and ends on October 16 (Sunday). Wait, the next month is September. So September 1 is a Thursday. Let me confirm that. August 31 is Wednesday, so September 1 is Thursday.\n\nSo September 1 is Thursday. Let's count the business days in September. September has 30 days. Let's see how many weeks and days that is. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. But since September starts on Thursday, the first week would be Thursday (Sep 1) to Monday (Sep 7), then the next weeks, etc.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the business days. Let's list the days:\n\nSeptember 1 (Thu), 2 (Fri), 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri).\n\nSo in September, the business days are all days except Saturdays and Sundays. Let's count them. From September 1 to September 30.\n\nEach week has 5 business days. There are 4 full weeks (28 days) plus 2 days (Sep 29 and 30). So 4 weeks * 5 = 20, plus 2 days (Thu and Fri) = 22 business days. Wait, but September has 30 days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, September 1 is Thursday. So the first week (Sep 1-7) has 5 business days (Thu-Fri, Mon-Wed? Wait, no. Wait, Sep 1 is Thursday, then 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday, 5 is Monday, 6 is Tuesday, 7 is Wednesday. So in that first week, the business days are 1-2 (Thu-Fri), then 5-7 (Mon-Wed). Wait, that's 2 + 3 = 5 days. Then the next week (Sep 8-14): 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed). Again, business days are 8-9 (Thu-Fri) and 12-14 (Mon-Wed) = 5 days. Similarly for the next weeks. So each week has 5 business days. Since September has 30 days, that's 4 weeks (28 days) and 2 days (Sep 29 and 30). So 4*5=20, plus 2 days (Thu and Fri) = 22 business days. So September has 22 business days.\n\nNow October. The period ends on October 16. Let's check October 1 is a Saturday. Wait, September 30 is a Friday. So October 1 is Saturday. Let me confirm that. September 30 is a Friday, so October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday, 4 is Tuesday, 5 is Wednesday, 6 is Thursday, 7 is Friday, 8 is Saturday, 9 is Sunday, 10 is Monday, 11 is Tuesday, 12 is Wednesday, 13 is Thursday, 14 is Friday, 15 is Saturday, 16 is Sunday.\n\nSo the period ends on October 16, which is a Sunday. So we need to count from October 1 (Saturday) to October 16 (Sunday). Let's count the business days in October up to the 16th.\n\nOctober 1 (Sat) - not business\n2 (Sun) - not\n3 (Mon) - business\n4 (Tue) - business\n5 (Wed) - business\n6 (Thu) - business\n7 (Fri) - business\n8 (Sat) - not\n9 (Sun) - not\n10 (Mon) - business\n11 (Tue) - business\n12 (Wed) - business\n13 (Thu) - business\n14 (Fri) - business\n15 (Sat) - not\n16 (Sun) - not\n\nSo from October 3 to 7 (5 days), then 10-14 (5 days). That's 5 + 5 = 10 business days in October.\n\nWait, but October 16 is included. So the days from October 3 to 7 (5 days) and October 10 to 14 (5 days) are 10 days. But October 16 is Sunday, which is not a business day. So total business days in October are 10.\n\nSo adding up August (13), September (22), and October (10) gives 13 + 22 = 35, plus 10 is 45. Wait, 13+22 is 35, plus 10 is 45. So total business days would be 45?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between August 14 and October 16 inclusive, then subtract the weekends.\n\nTotal days: Let's calculate the number of days from August 14 to October 16 inclusive.\n\nAugust has 31 days. From August 14 to August 31 is 18 days (as calculated earlier). September has 30 days. October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So total days is 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. Then September is 30 days. Then October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So total is 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days. But if that's the case, then the total days is 64. Now, how many weekends are in those 64 days?\n\nBut maybe that's a better approach. Let's try that.\n\nTotal days: 64. Now, how many weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are in those 64 days?\n\nBut to find that, we need to know how many Saturdays and Sundays are in the period.\n\nAlternatively, since the start date is a Sunday (August 14), and the end date is a Sunday (October 16), let's see how many weeks there are and the extra days.\n\nFrom August 14 (Sunday) to October 16 (Sunday) is exactly 64 days. Let's check how many weeks that is. 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. Wait, 9 weeks is 63 days, so 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day. So that would mean that there are 9 full weeks and one extra day. But since the start and end are both Sundays, the extra day would be the next day after the 9 weeks, which would be a Monday. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me check.\n\nWait, August 14 is a Sunday. Adding 7 days is August 21 (Sunday), then 28 (Sunday), then September 4 (Sunday), 11, 18, 25, October 2, 9, 16. So October 16 is the 9th Sunday. So from August 14 to October 16 is exactly 9 weeks (63 days) plus 1 day (October 16 is the 64th day). Wait, but that would mean that the total days are 63 + 1 = 64. So that's correct.\n\nIn 9 weeks, there are 9 Saturdays and 9 Sundays. So that's 18 weekend days. Then the extra day is October 16, which is a Sunday. So that's one more Sunday. So total weekend days would be 18 + 1 = 19. Therefore, the total business days would be 64 - 19 = 45. Which matches the previous count. So that's 45 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because if the total days are 64, and there are 19 weekend days, then 64 - 19 = 45. So that's the answer. But I need to make sure that the count of weekends is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in the period.\n\nStarting from August 14 (Sunday), the first Sunday is August 14. Then the next Sundays are August 21, 28, September 4, 11, 18, 25, October 2, 9, 16. That's 10 Sundays. Wait, that's 10 Sundays. But according to the previous calculation, there are 9 weeks and 1 day, so 9 Sundays plus the extra day (October 16) would be 10 Sundays. So that's correct. So 10 Sundays.\n\nNow, how many Saturdays? The first Saturday after August 14 is August 20. Then August 27, September 3, 10, 17, 24, October 1, 8, 15. Let's count them:\n\nAugust 20, 27 (2), September 3, 10, 17, 24 (another 4), October 1, 8, 15 (another 3). Total 2+4+3=9 Saturdays. So total weekends are 10 Sundays + 9 Saturdays = 19. So that's correct. Therefore, 64 total days minus 19 weekend days equals 45 business days.\n\nSo the answer should be 45. But let me check again with the previous method where I counted August (13), September (22), October (10) which adds up to 45. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the total number of business days is 45.", "45"], [49, "Count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022 - what's the weekday?

Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can divide 70 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that: 70 divided by 7 is 10. So 70 days is exactly 10 weeks. Wait, if that's the case, then subtracting 10 weeks from September 2, 2022, should land me on the same day of the week, right? Because a week is 7 days, so subtracting a multiple of 7 days doesn't change the weekday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me confirm the date. September 2, 2022, is a Friday. If I subtract 7 days, that would be August 26, 2022, which is also a Friday. Then subtract another 7 days, August 19, 2022, also Friday. So every 7 days, the weekday remains the same. Therefore, subtracting 70 days (which is 10 weeks) would still be a Friday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. But since we're dealing with September, that's not an issue here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's try that. Starting from September 2, 2022 (Friday). Let's subtract 7 days each time:\n\n- 7 days before: August 26, 2022 (Friday)\n- 14 days before: August 19, 2022 (Friday)\n- 21 days before: August 12, 2022 (Friday)\n- 28 days before: August 5, 2022 (Friday)\n- 35 days before: July 29, 2022 (Friday)\n- 42 days before: July 22, 2022 (Friday)\n- 49 days before: July 15, 2022 (Friday)\n- 56 days before: July 8, 2022 (Friday)\n- 63 days before: July 1, 2022 (Friday)\n- 70 days before: June 24, 2022 (Friday)\n\nWait, so according to this, June 24, 2022, is also a Friday. But that seems correct because each subtraction of 7 days keeps the same weekday. So the answer should be Friday. \n\nBut maybe I should check with another method. Let me use an online calendar or a date calculator to verify. Wait, I can't access external resources, but I can use my knowledge. Let me think. For example, if I know that September 2, 2022, is a Friday, then subtracting 70 days would be 10 weeks. So the same day. Therefore, the answer is Friday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for June 24, 2022. Let's see. Let's count the days from June 24 to September 2. June has 30 days, so from June 24 to June 30 is 6 days. Then July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September 2 is 2 days. So total days from June 24 to September 2 is 6 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 70 days. So that's correct. Therefore, June 24 is 70 days before September 2. And since 70 is a multiple of 7, the day of the week is the same. So Friday. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Friday.", "Friday"], [49, "In a year where Saturday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 27. Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the weekday of March 27 in a year where January 1st is a Saturday. Hmm, I need to figure out what day of the week March 27 falls on.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of days between January 1st and March 27th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year unless stated otherwise. So February has 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to March 27th would be 31 (January) - 1 (since January 1st is the starting day) + 28 (February) + 27 (March). Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then adding February's 28 days, that's 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then adding March 27 days would be 58 + 27 = 85 days total. Wait, but that's from January 1st to March 27th inclusive? Or exclusive?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If January 1st is day 0 (Saturday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Sunday), and so on. So to find the number of days between January 1st and March 27th, we need to count how many days are in between. So January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 27 (Mar) = 85 days. Wait, but that would be 85 days after January 1st. But if January 1st is day 0, then day 85 would be March 27th. But how does that translate to the weekday?\n\nSince each week has 7 days, we can find the remainder when 85 is divided by 7. Let's calculate 85 divided by 7. 7*12 is 84, so 85 is 84 +1, so remainder 1. So that means 85 days later is 1 day after Saturday. Because January 1st is Saturday. So adding 1 day would be Sunday. Wait, but wait. Wait, if day 0 is Saturday, then day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, etc. So day 85 would be 85 mod 7. 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (84 days) and 1 day. So day 85 is 1 day after Saturday, which is Sunday. So March 27th would be a Sunday?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 30 + 28 + 27 = 85 days. So 85 days after January 1st. So 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Saturday would be Sunday. So March 27th is Sunday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Saturday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Then January 8th is also Saturday, and so on. Let's see, January 1st is Saturday. Then January 8th is Saturday (7 days later). January 15th is Saturday, January 22nd is Saturday, January 29th is Saturday. Then February 5th is Saturday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is Saturday. Then March 12th, 19th, 26th. Wait, March 26th is Saturday. Then March 27th is Sunday. So that's correct. So March 27th is Sunday.

Wait, is that right? Let me check. Hmm, maybe I should count the days from a known date. Let's see, if October 1 is a Saturday, then October 8 would be 7 days later. Wait, that would make October 8 also a Saturday? But that seems too easy. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach. I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I go back from there, maybe I can figure out the days. But that might take longer. Alternatively, I can use the fact that October 8, 2022 is a specific date. Let me try to recall some key dates. For example, I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then adding 7 days would be the same day of the week. So October 8 would be a Saturday. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the days in October. If October 1 is Saturday, then October 2 is Sunday, October 3 is Monday, October 4 is Tuesday, October 5 is Wednesday, October 6 is Thursday, October 7 is Friday, and October 8 is Saturday. So that would make October 8 a Saturday. But I'm not sure if October 1, 2022 was actually a Saturday. Maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use an online calendar or a day calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me think of another way. For example, if I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Then July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday, August 1 is Monday. August 1 is Monday, so August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. September 5 is Monday, September 12 is Monday, September 19 is Monday, September 26 is Monday. October 3 is Monday.

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the dates. Let me check the actual dates. February 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. April 20, 2022 is a Wednesday. So the start date is a Tuesday, and the end date is a Wednesday. \n\nLet me break down the months involved. From February 1 to April 20. So February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. March has 31 days, and April has 30 days. \n\nSo from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March has 31 days, and then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days from February 1 to April 20 inclusive would be 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 20 (Apr) = 79 days? Wait, but wait, if I include both start and end dates, then maybe I need to check if that's correct. Wait, February 1 is day 1, and April 20 is day 79? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, February has 28 days. So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 28 + 31 = 59 days up to March 31. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days from February 1 to April 20 inclusive is 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. Wait, but that would be 28 days in February (including February 1), 31 in March, and 20 in April. So total 79 days. But wait, if I count from February 1 to April 20 inclusive, that's correct. So total days is 79.\n\nNow, out of these 79 days, how many are weekdays? Let's see. The start date is a Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then the next day, February 2 is Wednesday, and so on. So each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekends. But since the start and end dates are specific, maybe I need to calculate how many full weeks there are and then the remaining days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period and subtract that from the total days to get the weekdays.\n\nSo total days: 79. Let's find the number of weekends.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of weeks in 79 days. 79 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 2 days. So 11 weeks is 77 days, and 2 days remaining. So 11 weeks would have 11*2 = 22 weekend days. Then the remaining 2 days are February 28 (which is a Monday, since February 1 is Tuesday. Let me check that. Wait, February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday, February 2 is Wednesday, February 3 is Thursday, February 4 is Friday, February 5 is Saturday, February 6 is Sunday. So February 5 is Saturday, 6 is Sunday. Then February 7 is Monday. So February 28 would be... Let's calculate. February 1 is Tuesday. February 28 is 27 days later. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So 3 weeks later is Tuesday again, plus 6 days. Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. So February 28 is a Monday. Then the next day, February 29 is Tuesday (but 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days). Wait, so February 28 is Monday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 7 is Monday, March 8 is Tuesday, etc. So the remaining two days after 77 days (11 weeks) would be day 78 and 79. Day 78 is March 31 (since 77 days is 11 weeks, so day 77 is March 31? Wait, maybe I need to check that again. Wait, February has 28 days. So day 1 is Feb 1, day 28 is Feb 28. Then March 1 is day 29. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 29 + 30 = day 59. Then April 1 is day 60, and April 20 is day 60 + 19 = day 79. So day 79 is April 20. So the 77 days would be up to day 77, which is March 31. Then day 78 is April 1, and day 79 is April 2. Wait, no. Wait, day 77 is March 31. Then day 78 is April 1, day 79 is April 2. Wait, but the end date is April 20. So that's a problem. Wait, maybe my initial calculation of total days is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, from February 1 to April 20 inclusive. Let's count the days step by step. February has 28 days. So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 28 + 31 = 59 days up to March 31. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days is 59 + 20 = 79 days. So that's correct. So day 79 is April 20. So the 77 days would be up to March 31 (day 59 + 28 = 87? Wait, no. Wait, day 28 is February 28. Then March 1 is day 29. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 29 + 30 = day 59. Then April 1 is day 60, and April 20 is day 60 + 19 = day 79. So day 79 is April 20. So the 77 days would be up to day 77, which is April 19. Then day 78 is April 20? Wait, no. Wait, day 77 is April 19. Then day 78 is April 20? Wait, no. Wait, day 60 is April 1. So day 60 is April 1. Then day 61 is April 2, ..., day 60 + 19 = day 79 is April 20. So day 77 is April 19 (since 79 - 2 = 77). So day 77 is April 19. Then day 78 is April 20. Wait, but the end date is April 20, which is day 79. So that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if day 60 is April 1, then day 60 + 1 = day 61 is April 2, ..., day 60 + 19 = day 79 is April 20. So day 79 is April 20. So day 77 is April 18, day 78 is April 19, day 79 is April 20. So the remaining two days after 77 days (which is March 31) would be day 78 (April 1) and day 79 (April 2). Wait, no. Wait, day 77 is March 31. Then day 78 is April 1, day 79 is April 2. So the remaining two days after 77 days (March 31) are April 1 and April 2. But the total days from February 1 to April 20 is 79 days. So that's correct. So the 77 days are up to March 31, then the remaining two days are April 1 and April 2. Wait, but that's only two days. So the total days is 77 + 2 = 79. So that's correct.\n\nSo the total number of days is 79. Now, the number of weekends in this period. Let's calculate the number of weekends. \n\nFirst, the 11 weeks (77 days) would have 11 * 2 = 22 weekend days. Then the remaining two days are April 1 and April 2. Now, what day of the week are those?\n\nWe know that February 1 is a Tuesday. Let's check the days for the remaining two days. Let's find out what day April 1 is. \n\nSince February 1 is Tuesday, February 28 is Monday (as calculated earlier). Then March 1 is Tuesday. March has 31 days, so March 7 is Monday, March 8 is Tuesday, etc. March 31 is a Monday (since March 1 is Tuesday, March 7 is Monday, March 14 is Monday, March 21 is Monday, March 28 is Monday, March 31 is Monday). Wait, March 1 is Tuesday. March 7 is Monday (7 days later). March 14 is Monday, March 21 is Monday, March 28 is Monday, March 31 is Monday. So March 31 is a Monday. Then April 1 is Tuesday. So April 1 is Tuesday, April 2 is Wednesday. So the remaining two days (April 1 and April 2) are Tuesday and Wednesday, which are weekdays. Therefore, in the remaining two days, there are 0 weekend days. \n\nSo total weekend days are 22. Therefore, the number of weekdays is total days (79) minus weekend days (22) = 57. But wait, the start date is Tuesday (a weekday) and the end date is Wednesday (a weekday). So both are included. So the calculation should be correct. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the number of weekends. Let's check the first few days. February 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend is February 5 (Saturday) and February 6 (Sunday). Then March 5 (Saturday) and March 6 (Sunday), etc. So each week has two weekend days. So 11 weeks would have 22 weekend days. Then the remaining two days (April 1 and 2) are Tuesday and Wednesday, which are weekdays. So total weekends are 22. So 79 - 22 = 57 weekdays. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the number of weekdays directly. \n\nStarting from February 1 (Tuesday) to April 20 (Wednesday). Let's count the number of Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays. \n\nAlternatively, since the start date is Tuesday, and the end date is Wednesday, maybe the number of weekdays can be calculated as follows. \n\nEach week has 5 weekdays. The total number of weeks is 11 weeks (77 days) plus 2 days. So 11 weeks would have 11*5 = 55 weekdays. Then the remaining two days are Tuesday and Wednesday, which are both weekdays. So 55 + 2 = 57 weekdays. That matches the previous calculation. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 57.", "57"], [49, "Name the day of the week for 05/21/2022.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know the day of the week for. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards to find May 21.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's see. May has 31 days. So May 21 is 21 days into May. Wait, but how does that help me? Maybe I need to find the day of the week for a known date in May 2022 and then count the days from there.\n\nWait, if I can find out what day of the week May 1, 2022 was, then I can add 20 days to get to May 21. Let's try that. Let's say May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then May 8 would be Sunday, May 15 would be Sunday, and May 22 would be Sunday. Wait, but that would mean May 21 would be Saturday. But I'm not sure if May 1 was a Sunday. Maybe I need to check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use an online calendar or a perpetual calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or calculations. Let me think again. I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Saturdays. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. March 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 would be Saturdays. May 7, 14, 21, 28 would be Saturdays. Wait, so May 7, 2022 was a Saturday. Then May 21 would be 14 days later. Since 14 days is two weeks, so May 21 would also be a Saturday. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought May 22 was Sunday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, if May 7 is a Saturday, then adding 14 days (two weeks) would make May 21 also a Saturday. Then May 22 would be Sunday. So that would mean May 21, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to confirm if May 7, 2022 was indeed a Saturday. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, and so on. Let's count the days for February. January has 31 days, so February 1, 2022 would be 31 days after January 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 would be 3 days after Saturday, which is Tuesday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. Then March 1 would be 28 days later (February 2022 has 28 days, since it's not a leap year). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 would be Tuesday as well. Then April 1 would be 28 days after March 1 (March has 31 days, so April 1 is 31 days after March 1. Wait, March has 31 days, so April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. Then May 1 would be 31 days after April 1. April has 30 days, so May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 would be Friday + 2 days = Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday. Therefore, May 21 would be Saturday. But earlier when I thought that May 7 was Saturday, that would be 6 days after May 1. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 7 is Saturday. So that's correct. So May 7 is Saturday, May 14 is Saturday, May 21 is Saturday. Therefore, May 21, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to make sure that my calculation of May 1 being Sunday is correct. Let me check again. January 1, 2022 is Saturday. January has 31 days. So February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 is Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. Then March 1 is 28 days after February 1 (since February 2022 has 28 days). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is Tuesday. April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 is Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 is Friday + 2 days = Sunday. That seems correct. Therefore, May 1 is Sunday. So May 21 is 20 days after May 1. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. Therefore, May 21, 2022 was a Saturday. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday. So May 21 is one day before Sunday, which is Saturday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday. But I need to make sure that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is correct. Let me check that. I can use another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be 1 day later, which is Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, that's a problem. If January 1, 2021 was a Monday, then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. But earlier I thought it was Saturday. That's a contradiction. So where did I go wrong? Let me check again. Wait, maybe I confused the years. Let me check. Let me recall that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days because it was a leap year. So 366 days is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Oh, that's correct. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So my initial assumption was correct. Then why did I get confused with the 2021 calculation? Because I thought January 1, 2021 was a Monday, but actually, if January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday, then 2020 had 366 days, so 2021 started on Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, so 2022 started on Saturday. So that's correct. Therefore, my previous calculation is correct. So May 1, 2022 is Sunday. Therefore, May 21 is Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday. But I need to make sure that May 21 is indeed 20 days after May 1. May 1 is day 1, May 2 is day 2, ..., May 21 is day 21. So 21 - 1 = 20 days later. So 20 days after May 1 is May 21. So 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. Therefore, the answer is Saturday.", "Saturday"], [49, "Determine if the year 2028 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2028 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2028 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2028 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2028 minus 2000 is 28. 28 divided by 4 is 7. So 500 + 7 is 507. That means 2028 divided by 4 is 507 with no remainder. So that's good, it's divisible by 4.\n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 2028 divided by 100 is 20.28, which isn't a whole number. So it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition about being divisible by 400 doesn't apply here.\n\nSince it's divisible by 4 and not a century year, according to the rules, 2028 should be a leap year. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the division. 4 times 500 is 2000, plus 4 times 7 is 28, so 2000 + 28 is 2028. Yep, that's correct.

Give the weekday name in full.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week August 27, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use a known date that I'm certain about. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that August 27, 2022 is a specific date. Let me try to count the days from a known date. Let's say I know that August 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that true? Wait, no. Let me think. If I can find a reference point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. So if I go back from there. Let me check. Wait, maybe I should use an online calendar or some method. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or logical calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of Zeller's Congruence. Let me recall the formula. Zeller's Congruence is an algorithm to calculate the day of the week for any Julian or Gregorian calendar date. The formula for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, I need to adjust the month and year accordingly. So for August 27, 2022, the month is 8, which is August. So m is 8, and the year is 2022. So q is 27, m is 8, K is 22 (2022 mod 100), J is 20 (floor(2022 / 100) = 20).\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (27 + floor((13*(8 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate floor((13*(8 + 1))/5). 8 + 1 is 9. 13*9 is 117. Divided by 5 is 23.4, so floor is 23.\n\nNext, floor(22/4) is 5 (since 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, floor is 5).\n\nfloor(20/4) is 5.\n\n5*20 is 100.\n\nSo adding all the terms:\n\n27 + 23 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 27 + 23 is 50, plus 22 is 72, plus 5 is 77, plus 5 is 82, plus 100 is 182.\n\nNow, 182 mod 7. Since 7*26 is 182, so 182 mod 7 is 0. According to Zeller's Congruence, h=0 corresponds to Saturday. Wait, but the formula says h=0 is Saturday. So that would mean August 27, 2022 was a Saturday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me re-calculate the formula step by step.\n\nq = 27\n\nm = 8\n\nK = 22\n\nJ = 20\n\nSo:\n\nfloor((13*(m + 1))/5) = floor((13*(8+1))/5) = floor(13*9/5) = floor(117/5) = floor(23.4) = 23. Correct.\n\nThen K is 22, floor(K/4) is floor(22/4) = 5. Correct.\n\nfloor(J/4) is floor(20/4) = 5. Correct.\n\n5*J is 5*20 = 100. Correct.\n\nSo adding all terms: 27 + 23 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 27 + 23 is 50, plus 22 is 72, plus 5 is 77, plus 5 is 82, plus 100 is 182. 182 divided by 7 is exactly 26, so remainder 0. So h=0 is Saturday. But according to Zeller's Congruence, h=0 is Saturday. So that would mean August 27, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, some sources say that h is 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, etc. So if the result is 0, then Saturday. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me check with another date. For example, January 1, 2022. Let's apply the formula to that date. January 1, 2022. Since January is treated as month 13 of the previous year, so m=13, year is 2021. So q=1, m=13, K=21 (2021 mod 100), J=20 (floor(2021/100)=20).\n\nh = (1 + floor((13*(13 + 1))/5) + 21 + floor(21/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculating:\n\nfloor((13*14)/5) = floor(182/5) = 36.4 \u2192 36.\n\nfloor(21/4) = 5.\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5.\n\n5*20 = 100.\n\nSo total is 1 + 36 + 21 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 1 + 36 is 37, plus 21 is 58, plus 5 is 63, plus 5 is 68, plus 100 is 168. 168 mod 7 is 0. So h=0, which would be Saturday. But January 1, 2022 was actually a Sunday. So that suggests that my formula might be incorrect. Wait, that's a problem. So maybe I got the formula wrong. Maybe the h is 0 = Sunday? Or maybe I have the formula wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let me check the correct Zeller's Congruence formula. According to some sources, the formula for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nBut the value of h is 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday. Wait, but if that's the case, then January 1, 2022 would be h=0, which is Saturday, but in reality it was a Sunday. So that suggests that maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check again. For January 1, 2022, m is 13 (since January is treated as month 13 of the previous year), so the year is 2021. So K is 21 (2021 mod 100), J is 20 (floor(2021/100) = 20). So:\n\nq = 1, m = 13, K = 21, J = 20.\n\nSo:\n\nfloor(13*(13 + 1)/5) = floor(13*14/5) = floor(182/5) = 36.4 \u2192 36.\n\nThen K is 21, floor(21/4) is 5 (since 21/4 is 5.25).\n\nfloor(J/4) is floor(20/4) = 5.\n\n5*J is 5*20 = 100.\n\nSo total is 1 + 36 + 21 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 1 + 36 is 37, plus 21 is 58, plus 5 is 63, plus 5 is 68, plus 100 is 168. 168 mod 7 is 0. So h=0, which is Saturday. But January 1, 2022 was actually a Sunday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, maybe the formula is different. Maybe the formula uses a different value for h. Alternatively, maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me check another source.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is h = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7, but with h=0 being Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then for January 1, 2022, h=0 would be Sunday, which matches. But according to the calculation, h=0. So maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe I have the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe the formula is h = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7, and h=0 is Saturday, but that's conflicting with the actual date. So perhaps I need to check another date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's think about known dates. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4, 2022 is a Monday, then August 27 is 43 days later (since July has 31 days, so 31 - 4 = 27 days in July after July 4, plus 27 days in August). Wait, no. Wait, July 4 is the 4th, so from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August 27 is 27 days after July 31. So total days from July 4 to August 27 is 27 + 27 = 54 days. Wait, but 54 days later. Let me check if that's correct. July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August 27 is 27 days into August. So total days between July 4 and August 27 is 27 + 27 = 54 days. Now, 54 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 5 days. So if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 5 days would be Monday + 5 days = Saturday. So August 27 would be a Saturday. That matches the Zeller's Congruence result. But wait, if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 54 days would be 54 mod 7 = 54 - 7*7 = 54 - 49 = 5. So 5 days later. Monday + 5 days is Saturday. So that would mean August 27 is a Saturday. But I need to confirm if July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me think. I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. For example, I can check that by knowing that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday. Yes, because July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. So that's correct. Therefore, if July 4 is Monday, then August 27 is Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to apply Zeller's Congruence to January 1, 2022, I got a conflicting result. But maybe that was because of a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct, but I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again. Let me check January 1, 2022. If January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then according to the formula, h should be 1 (if h=0 is Saturday, then Sunday is 1). Let me recalculate the formula for January 1, 2022.\n\nq = 1, m = 13 (since January is treated as month 13 of the previous year), year is 2021. So K = 21 (2021 mod 100), J = 20 (floor(2021/100) = 20).\n\nh = (1 + floor(13*(13 + 1)/5) + 21 + floor(21/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculating:\n\nfloor(13*(14)/5) = floor(182/5) = 36.4 \u2192 36.\n\nfloor(21/4) = 5.\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5.\n\n5*20 = 100.\n\nSo total is 1 + 36 + 21 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 1 + 36 = 37, +21 = 58, +5 = 63, +5 = 68, +100 = 168. 168 mod 7 is 0. So h=0. If h=0 is Saturday, then January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, maybe the formula is different. Maybe the formula uses h=0 as Sunday. Let me check that. If h=0 is Sunday, then January 1, 2022 would be Sunday, which matches. So maybe the formula is h=0 is Sunday. But according to the formula, the calculation gives h=0. So that would mean that the formula is correct if h=0 is Sunday. But I need to check the original formula.\n\nLooking up Zeller's Congruence, the formula for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nwhere h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday). Wait, that's what I used before. So if that's the case, then January 1, 2022 would be Saturday, but in reality it was Sunday. So there's a discrepancy. Therefore, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust the formula for the month. Wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. Let me check the correct Zeller's Congruence formula.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia page, the formula for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nwhere:\n\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nSo for January 1, 2022, since January is treated as month 13 of the previous year, the year becomes 2021. So m=13, K=21, J=20. Then the calculation is as before, which gives h=0, which is Saturday. But in reality, January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. This suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct, but the actual date is different. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the actual date. Let me check. January 1, 2022: I can check online, but since I can't, I need to rely on my memory. I think that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday.

Hmm, first, I should check what day of the week July 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the days would go like this: July 1 is Friday, so July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday, July 5 is Tuesday. Wait, so the first Tuesday would be July 5th? But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the weeks. If July 1 is a Friday, then the next Tuesday would be July 5. Because Friday (1st), Saturday (2nd), Sunday (3rd), Monday (4th), Tuesday (5th). So that's five days later. So the first Tuesday is the 5th. But wait, is that correct? Let me check another way. Maybe looking up a calendar for July 2022.

So yes, July 5 is the first Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be 5. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If July 1 is Friday, then the first Tuesday would be the 5th.

The problem says that January 1st was a Sunday, and I need to find out what day of the week January 21st falls on. Hmm, right. So first, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 21st. \n\nWell, January 1st is day 1, so January 21st would be 20 days later, right? Because from the 1st to the 21st is 20 days. Wait, let me check that again. If January 1 is day 1, then adding 20 days would take me to day 21. So yes, 20 days later.\n\nNow, since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can divide 20 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days that is. Let me do the division. 7 times 2 is 14, and 20 minus 14 is 6. So that's 2 weeks and 6 days. So 20 days later is the same as 6 days after Sunday.\n\nStarting from Sunday, adding 1 day is Monday, 2 days is Tuesday, 3 days Wednesday, 4 days Thursday, 5 days Friday, and 6 days Saturday.

So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2015. First, divide 2015 by 4. Let me do the division: 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2015 minus 2000 is 15. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75. So 2015 divided by 4 is 503.75. That means 2015 is not divisible by 4.

But I need to confirm the actual weekday.\n\nFirst, I can try to recall some anchor dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use a known date. For instance, I remember that July 4, 2022, was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4 is a Monday, then counting backwards, June 26 would be 7 days earlier, which would be a Monday minus 7 days, which is also a Monday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, if July 4 is a Monday, then June 26 is 8 days earlier. Wait, July 4 minus 8 days would be June 26. Let me count: July 4 is Monday. July 3 is Sunday, July 2 is Saturday, July 1 is Friday. Then June 30 is Thursday, June 29 is Wednesday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 27 is Monday, June 26 is Sunday. Wait, that would make June 26 a Sunday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that June 26, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to be sure. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that June 1, 2022, was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If June 1 is Wednesday, then June 8 is also Wednesday, June 15, 22, 29. So June 22 is Wednesday. Then June 26 would be 4 days later, which would be Sunday. So that would make June 26 a Sunday. But I need to confirm if June 1, 2022, was indeed a Wednesday. Alternatively, maybe I can use another anchor date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then June 26 is 5 days earlier. So June 26 would be a Friday minus 5 days. Let's count: Friday (July 1) minus 1 day is Thursday (June 30), minus 2 is Wednesday (June 29), minus 3 is Tuesday (June 28), minus 4 is Monday (June 27), minus 5 is Sunday (June 26). So that also points to Sunday. So both methods suggest that June 26, 2022, was a Sunday. Therefore, the answer should be Sunday.", "Sunday"], [49, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, July 31 to Sunday, October 2, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between July 31, 2022 (Sunday) and October 2, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates. \n\nJuly 31, 2022 is a Sunday. Then August 1 is a Monday. Let me list out the days for each month.\n\nStarting from July 31 (Sunday), August 1 is Monday. Let's count the days in each month:\n\nJuly has 31 days. Since July 31 is Sunday, the next day, August 1 is Monday. So from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is the start date. So from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days (including July 31 and August 31). Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is day 1. Then August has 31 days. So from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days (July 31 is day 1, August 31 is day 31). Then September has 30 days, and October 1 is a Monday (since October 2 is Sunday). Wait, let me check the actual dates.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual days of the week for each date. Let me confirm:\n\nJuly 31, 2022 is a Sunday. August 1 is Monday. August 2 is Tuesday, etc. Then August has 31 days. So August 31 is a Wednesday (since 31 days later: 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So August 31 is Wednesday. Then September 1 is Thursday. September has 30 days. So September 30 is a Friday (since 30 days later: 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday? Wait, wait. Wait, September 1 is Thursday. September 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. So September 29 is Thursday. Then September 30 is Friday. Then October 1 is Saturday. October 2 is Sunday. So the end date is October 2, which is Sunday.\n\nSo the period is from July 31 (Sunday) to October 2 (Sunday). Let's count the days in each month:\n\nJuly: 31 days, but we start on July 31, so that's 1 day (July 31).\n\nAugust: 31 days.\n\nSeptember: 30 days.\n\nOctober: 2 days (October 1 and 2). Wait, but the end date is October 2, so that's included. So total days from July 31 to October 2 inclusive is 1 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 2 (October) = 64 days? Wait, wait. Wait, July 31 is day 1. Then August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 32. Then September has 30 days, so September 30 is day 32 + 30 = 62. Then October 1 is day 63, October 2 is day 64. So total 64 days.\n\nNow, need to count how many of those 64 days are weekdays (Monday-Friday). Let's break it down by month.\n\nFirst, July 31 is Sunday. So that's one day. Then August 1 is Monday. Let's count the weekdays in each month.\n\nJuly: Only July 31 is included. That's a Sunday, which is a weekend. So 0 weekdays in July.\n\nAugust: 31 days. Let's count the number of weekdays. August 1 is Monday. August 31 is Wednesday. So the days in August are from Monday (Aug 1) to Wednesday (Aug 31). Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays.\n\nIn August, there are 4 full weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. So 4 weeks have 4 of each weekday. Then the extra 3 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So total weekdays in August: 4*5 (each weekday in the 4 weeks) + 3 (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) = 20 + 3 = 23 weekdays? Wait, no. Wait, the 4 weeks have 4 Mondays, 4 Tuesdays, etc. So 4*5 = 20 weekdays. Then the extra 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) add 3 more weekdays. So total 23 weekdays in August.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, August 1 is Monday. So the first day is Monday. The last day of August is August 31, which is Wednesday. So the extra days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So yes, 3 weekdays. So 20 + 3 = 23 weekdays in August.\n\nSeptember: 30 days. September 1 is Thursday. September 30 is Friday. So September has 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks have 4 of each weekday. The extra 2 days are Thursday and Friday. So weekdays in September: 4*5 (20) + 2 (Thursday, Friday) = 22 weekdays.\n\nOctober: 2 days. October 1 is Saturday, October 2 is Sunday. Both are weekends. So 0 weekdays in October.\n\nSo total weekdays: 0 (July) + 23 (August) + 22 (September) + 0 (October) = 45 weekdays.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days (64) and subtract the number of weekends.\n\nTotal days: 64.\n\nNumber of weekends: Sundays and Saturdays.\n\nLet's count the number of Sundays and Saturdays in the period.\n\nJuly 31 is Sunday. Then August 1 is Monday. So the Sundays in the period would be July 31, August 7, 14, 21, 28. Then September 4, 11, 18, 25. Then October 2. Wait, let's check:\n\nJuly 31 is Sunday.\n\nAugust 7 is Sunday (since July 31 is Sunday, adding 6 days is August 7).\n\nAugust 14, 21, 28 are Sundays.\n\nSeptember 4, 11, 18, 25 are Sundays.\n\nOctober 2 is Sunday.\n\nSo that's 1 (July 31) + 4 (August 7,14,21,28) + 4 (September 4,11,18,25) + 1 (October 2) = 1+4+4+1=10 Sundays.\n\nNow Saturdays: Let's count the Saturdays in the period.\n\nJuly 31 is Sunday, so July 30 is Saturday. But July 30 is not included in the period (the period starts on July 31). So the first Saturday in the period is August 6 (since August 1 is Monday, August 6 is Saturday). Then August 13, 20, 27. September 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. October 1 is Saturday. Wait, October 1 is Saturday, October 2 is Sunday. So the Saturdays in the period are:\n\nAugust 6, 13, 20, 27 (4 Saturdays)\n\nSeptember 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 (5 Saturdays)\n\nOctober 1 (1 Saturday)\n\nTotal Saturdays: 4 + 5 + 1 = 10.\n\nSo total weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are 10 + 10 = 20.\n\nTotal days is 64. So weekdays would be 64 - 20 = 44.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation said 45. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm. Let me check again.\n\nFirst method: August had 23 weekdays, September 22, total 45. Second method: total days 64, minus 20 weekends, gives 44. So which is correct?\n\nLet me check the count of weekends again. Let's list all the Sundays and Saturdays in the period.\n\nSundays:\n\nJuly 31 (included)\n\nAugust 7, 14, 21, 28 (included)\n\nSeptember 4, 11, 18, 25 (included)\n\nOctober 2 (included)\n\nThat's 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10 Sundays. Correct.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nAugust 6, 13, 20, 27 (included)\n\nSeptember 3, 10, 17, 24, 30 (wait, September 30 is a Friday? Wait earlier I thought September 30 is Friday. Let me check again.\n\nEarlier, I said September 1 is Thursday. So September 1 is Thursday. Then September 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. So September 29 is Thursday. September 30 is Friday. So September 30 is Friday. Therefore, September 31 is Saturday? Wait, September has 30 days. So September 30 is Friday. Then October 1 is Saturday. So the Saturdays in September are September 3, 10, 17, 24, and then October 1. Wait, September 3 is Saturday. Then September 10 is Saturday, 17, 24. Then September 30 is Friday. So September has 4 Saturdays (3,10,17,24). Then October 1 is Saturday. So that's 4 + 1 = 5 Saturdays. So that's correct. So total Saturdays are 4 (August) + 5 (September) + 1 (October) = 10. So total weekends 20. So 64 - 20 = 44 weekdays.\n\nBut earlier calculation said 23 + 22 = 45. So where is the mistake?\n\nLet me check August's weekdays again. August 1 is Monday. August 31 is Wednesday. So August has 31 days. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays.\n\nIn August, the first day is Monday (Aug 1). The last day is Wednesday (Aug 31). So how many weeks are there? 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). So in the 4 weeks, there are 4 of each weekday. Then the extra 3 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So total Mondays: 4 + 1 = 5. Tuesdays: 4 + 1 = 5. Wednesdays: 4 + 1 = 5. Thursdays: 4. Fridays: 4. So total weekdays in August: 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 23. That's correct. So 23.\n\nSeptember: 30 days. September 1 is Thursday. So September has 4 weeks and 2 days. The 4 weeks have 4 of each weekday. The extra days are Thursday and Friday. So Thursdays: 4 + 1 = 5. Fridays: 4 + 1 = 5. The other weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) are 4 each. So total weekdays: 4*3 (Mon, Tue, Wed) + 5 (Thu) + 5 (Fri) = 12 + 5 +5 = 22. Correct. So 22.\n\nSo total is 23 + 22 = 45. But according to the other method, it's 44. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 64. Let me check again. From July 31 to October 2 inclusive.\n\nJuly 31 is day 1. August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 32. September has 30 days, so September 30 is day 32 + 30 = 62. October 1 is day 63, October 2 is day 64. So total 64 days. Correct.\n\nSo if total days is 64, and weekends are 20, then weekdays are 44. But according to the other method, it's 45. So there's a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the count of weekends is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nSundays: 10. Saturdays: 10. Total 20. So 64 - 20 = 44. But according to the other method, 23 + 22 = 45. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of Sundays or Saturdays.\n\nLet me list all the dates:\n\nSundays:\n\nJuly 31 (included)\n\nAugust 7, 14, 21, 28 (included)\n\nSeptember 4, 11, 18, 25 (included)\n\nOctober 2 (included)\n\nThat's 10 Sundays. Correct.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nAugust 6, 13, 20, 27 (included)\n\nSeptember 3, 10, 17, 24 (included)\n\nOctober 1 (included)\n\nThat's 4 + 4 + 1 = 9? Wait, August has 4 Saturdays (6,13,20,27). September has 4 Saturdays (3,10,17,24). October 1 is Saturday. So that's 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 Saturdays. Wait, earlier I said 10. Wait, that's the mistake! Earlier I said September has 5 Saturdays, but that's incorrect. Because September 30 is Friday, so September 31 is Saturday, but September only has 30 days. So September's last day is September 30, which is Friday. So the last Saturday in September is September 24. Then October 1 is Saturday. So September has 4 Saturdays (3,10,17,24). So total Saturdays are 4 (August) + 4 (September) + 1 (October) = 9. So total weekends are 10 Sundays + 9 Saturdays = 19. Then total weekdays would be 64 - 19 = 45. Which matches the first method. So earlier mistake was in counting the number of Saturdays in September. I thought there were 5, but actually there are 4. So that's the error.\n\nSo the correct number of weekends is 19, not 20. Therefore, 64 - 19 = 45 weekdays. So the correct answer is 45.", "45"], [49, "How many Tuesdays are there from Saturday, October 29, 2022 to Sunday, October 30, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

So I need to figure out the days of the week for those dates and count the Tuesdays.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week October 29, 2022, was. The user mentioned it's a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If October 29 is a Saturday, then October 30 would be a Sunday. So the period is from Saturday the 29th to Sunday the 30th. \n\nNow, the question is, are there any Tuesdays in this two-day period? Well, if the first day is Saturday, the next day is Sunday. So the days in between are Saturday and Sunday. There's no Tuesday in there. So the answer should be zero?\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me think. Let's count the days. October 29 is Saturday. Then October 30 is Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. So between those two dates, there's no Tuesday. Therefore, the count of Tuesdays is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's a possibility that the dates could include a Tuesday.

First, I should check the dates to make sure I have the correct start and end points. The problem says both dates are counted, so that's important.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the total number of days between those two dates. Then, since the days of the week repeat every 7 days, I can divide the total days by 7 and find out how many full weeks there are, and then check if there are any extra days that include a Friday.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just count the number of Fridays directly. But how? Let me think. Alternatively, I can calculate the total number of days in the period and then see how many times Friday occurs.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the total number of days from April 9, 2022, to July 1, 2022, inclusive. Let's break it down month by month.\n\nFirst, April. April 9 is the starting date. April has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 inclusive, how many days is that? Let's calculate: 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. Wait, because if you include both the start and end dates, it's (end - start + 1). So April 9 to April 30 is 22 days.\n\nThen May has 31 days. Then June has 30 days. Then July 1 is the end date. So adding those up: April has 22 days, May 31, June 30, and July 1 is 1 day. Wait, but July 1 is included, so the total days would be 22 + 31 + 30 + 1? Wait, no. Wait, the period is from April 9 to July 1 inclusive. So April 9 to April 30 is 22 days. Then May is 31 days, June is 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. Wait, but that would be 22 + 31 + 30 + 1? Wait, no. Wait, if you go from April 9 to July 1, that's April 9 to April 30 (22 days), then May (31 days), June (30 days), and July 1 (1 day). Wait, but that would be 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days? Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm adding the July 1 day twice. Let me check again.\n\nWait, April 9 to April 30 is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 22 + 31 = 53. Then June has 30 days, so 53 + 30 = 83. Then July 1 is the next day, so adding 1 day would make it 84. But that seems like a lot. Wait, but maybe I should check the actual number of days between those dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calculator or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to calculate it manually. Let me check again.\n\nApril 9 to April 30: April has 30 days. So from the 9th to the 30th inclusive is 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. Correct.\n\nMay has 31 days. So adding that gives 22 + 31 = 53 days.\n\nJune has 30 days. So 53 + 30 = 83 days.\n\nJuly 1 is the next day, so adding 1 day makes it 84 days total. So the total number of days between April 9 and July 1 inclusive is 84 days.\n\nNow, if there are 84 days in total, then since a week has 7 days, 84 divided by 7 is exactly 12 weeks. So that would mean there are 12 Fridays in total. But wait, that's only if the period starts on a Saturday and ends on a Friday. Wait, but the starting date is Saturday, April 9, 2022. Let me check what day of the week April 9, 2022, was. Wait, I need to confirm that.\n\nWait, the problem says that the period starts on Saturday, April 9, 2022. So that's the first day. So if the first day is a Saturday, then the next day, April 10, is Sunday, and so on. So the first week would have Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So the first Friday would be April 15, 2022. Wait, but April 9 is Saturday. Let me count:\n\nApril 9: Saturday\n\nApril 10: Sunday\n\nApril 11: Monday\n\nApril 12: Tuesday\n\nApril 13: Wednesday\n\nApril 14: Thursday\n\nApril 15: Friday\n\nSo the first Friday is April 15. Then the next Friday would be April 22, then April 29, then May 6, 13, 20, 27, June 3, 10, 17, 24, July 1. Wait, July 1 is a Friday. So let's count them.\n\nLet me list all the Fridays in that period:\n\nApril 15, 22, 29.\n\nMay 6, 13, 20, 27.\n\nJune 3, 10, 17, 24.\n\nJuly 1.\n\nSo that's 3 (April) + 4 (May) + 4 (June) + 1 (July) = 12 Fridays. So that matches the 12 weeks. So the answer is 12.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because if the total days are 84, which is exactly 12 weeks, then each day of the week occurs exactly 12 times. But since the period starts on a Saturday and ends on a Friday, that would mean that each day of the week occurs 12 times. So that would include 12 Fridays. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the actual dates again. Let me check if July 1, 2022, is indeed a Friday. Because if that's not the case, then my count is wrong.\n\nWait, April 9, 2022, is a Saturday. Let me check the days for the next weeks. April 15 is Friday. Then April 22 is Friday, April 29 is Friday. Then May 6 is Friday. May 13, 20, 27. Then June 3, 10, 17, 24. Then July 1. Let me check July 1, 2022. If June 3 is a Friday, then June 10 is Friday, June 17 is Friday, June 24 is Friday. Then July 1 is the next Friday. So that would be correct. So July 1 is a Friday.

October 24, 2022, is a Monday. Then, the next Monday is November 1, 2022. Then December 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023. So January 16, 2023, is a Monday. Therefore, if the end date is January 16, 2023, that would be correct. But the user wrote 2022. So perhaps the user made a mistake. However, since I have to answer based on the given dates, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the end date is January 16, 2023. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the end date to be January 16, 2022, but that's earlier than October 24, 2022. Therefore, the period would be from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, which is not possible. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the question. However, since I need to answer, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the end date is January 16, 2023. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the dates to be in the same year but the end date is later. But that's not possible. Therefore, I think the correct answer is that there's a mistake in the question. However, since I need to provide an answer, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the end date is January 16, 2023. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if the start date is October 24, 2022, and the end date is January 16, 2023, then the period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. Let's calculate the number of business days between those dates.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days between October 24, 2022, and January 16, 2023. Then subtract the weekends.\n\nOctober 24, 2022, to October 31, 2022: October has 31 days. From October 24 to October 31 is 8 days (including both dates). Wait, October 24 is day 1, October 25 is day 2, ..., October 31 is day 8. So that's 8 days.\n\nThen November 2022: 30 days.\n\nDecember 2022: 31 days.\n\nJanuary 2023: from January 1 to January 16 is 16 days.\n\nTotal days: 8 + 30 + 31 + 16 = 85 days.\n\nNow, subtract the weekends. Let's check the days.\n\nOctober 24, 2022, is a Monday. So October 24 is Monday, 25 is Tuesday, 26 is Wednesday, 27 is Thursday, 28 is Friday, 29 is Saturday, 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday.\n\nSo in October, from 24 to 31: 8 days. The weekends are October 29 (Saturday) and 30 (Sunday). So 2 weekend days.\n\nNovember 2022: 30 days. November 1 is a Tuesday (since October 31 is Monday, November 1 is Tuesday). So November has 30 days. Let's count the number of weekends in November. Each week has 2 weekend days. November has 30 days, which is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks (28 days) have 4*2=8 weekend days. The remaining 2 days are November 29 (Wednesday) and 30 (Thursday). So no additional weekends. So total weekends in November: 8.\n\nDecember 2022: 31 days. December 1 is a Thursday (since November 30 is a Wednesday). December has 31 days. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks have 8 weekend days. The remaining 3 days are December 27 (Wednesday), 28 (Thursday), 29 (Friday). So no additional weekends. So total weekends in December: 8.\n\nJanuary 2023: January 1 is a Saturday (since December 31 is a Friday). January 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday, ..., 16 is Monday. So in January, the weekends are January 1 (Saturday), 2 (Sunday), 8 (Saturday), 9 (Sunday), 15 (Saturday), 16 (Sunday). Wait, January 16 is a Monday. So the weekends in January are January 1, 2, 8, 9, 15. That's 5 weekend days. Wait, January 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday. Then 8 is Saturday, 9 is Sunday. 15 is Saturday, 16 is Sunday. But the end date is January 16, which is a Monday. So the last weekend day is January 15 (Saturday). So in January, there are 5 weekend days (1, 2, 8, 9, 15).\n\nSo total weekends: October (2) + November (8) + December (8) + January (5) = 23 weekend days.\n\nTotal days between the dates: 85. So business days = 85 - 23 = 62.\n\nBut wait, the original question says the end date is January 16, 2022. But that's earlier than October 24, 2022. So that's impossible. Therefore, the correct end date must be January 16, 2023. Therefore, the answer is 62 business days. But the user might have made a mistake in the year. However, since the user provided the dates as October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, which is invalid, but assuming that the end date is January 16, 2023, the answer is 62. Alternatively, if the user intended the end date to be January 16, 2022, which is earlier, then the period is invalid. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 62, assuming the end date is January 16, 2023. But the user might have made a mistake. However, since I have to answer based on the given dates, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the end date is January 16, 2023. Therefore, the answer is 62.", "62"], [49, "On which weekday did October 1, 2022 fall? Reply with just the weekday name.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022 fell on. Let me think. I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but maybe I should verify that. Let me try to recall some key dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. If I can figure out the day for a known date and then count backwards or forwards, that might help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use some known reference points. For instance, I remember that October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check. Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's think about the days of the week. Each year, the same date shifts by one day because of the leap year. But 2022 is not a leap year, so October 1, 2022 would be one day later than October 1, 2021. Wait, but if I can't remember the exact day for 2021, maybe I need another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Then, if I count the days from July 4 to October 1, that would be 28 days (July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days, plus August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October 1 is the first day. Wait, no. Wait, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since July 4 is day 0, then July 5 is +1, etc.), then August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October 1 is the next day. So from July 4 to October 1 is 27 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 1 (October 1) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 1 is 89 days. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since July 4 is day 0, July 5 is day 1, ..., July 31 is day 27). Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days gets to August 31. Then September has 30 days, so adding 30 days gets to September 30. Then October 1 is one day after that. So total days from July 4 to October 1 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 89 days. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Wait, maybe I should count the number of days between July 4 and October 1. Let me check again. July has 31 days. From July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October 1 is the next day. So total days from July 4 to October 1 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 89 days. Wait, but that's 89 days. Now, 89 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 5 days. So if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 5 days would be Monday + 5 days = Saturday. So October 1 would be a Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But wait, I thought that maybe I was wrong about July 4 being a Monday. Let me check that. Wait, I think July 4, 2022 was actually a Monday. Let me confirm. If I recall, July 4, 2022 was a Monday. So if that's correct, then adding 89 days would be 12 weeks and 5 days, so Monday + 5 days is Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Alternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that October 1, 2023 is a Saturday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think. If I can remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then that's the answer. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I count the days from January 1, 2023 to October 1, 2022. Wait, that's going back in time. Let me think. January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then November 30, 2022 would be a Friday. Then October 31, 2022 would be a Thursday. Then October 1, 2022 would be 29 days before October 31. Wait, 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day. So if October 31 is a Thursday, then October 1 would be a Thursday minus 1 day, which is Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. Hmm, so now I'm confused. Which one is correct? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 is a Saturday. Then November 30, 2022 is a Friday. Then October 31, 2022 is a Thursday. Then October 31 is Thursday. So October 1 is 29 days before that. Let's count the days between October 1 and October 31. October has 31 days, so October 1 to October 31 is 30 days. Wait, no. From October 1 to October 31 is 30 days (since October 1 is day 0, October 2 is day 1, ..., October 31 is day 30). So 30 days. So if October 31 is a Thursday, then October 1 is 30 days before that. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So subtracting 2 days from Thursday would be Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. So now I'm getting two different results: Saturday and Tuesday. That can't be right. So where is the mistake here? Let me check again. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 is a Saturday. Then November 30, 2022 is a Friday. Then October 31, 2022 is a Thursday. Now, October 1 is 30 days before October 31. So 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if October 31 is a Thursday, then October 1 would be Thursday minus 2 days, which is Tuesday. But earlier, using the July 4 method, I thought it was Saturday. So which is correct? Maybe I made a mistake in the July 4 calculation. Let me check July 4, 2022. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then adding 89 days would be 12 weeks and 5 days, so Monday + 5 days is Saturday. But if October 1 is Tuesday, then that would mean that July 4 is a Monday, but that would mean that July 4 to October 1 is 89 days. Wait, but if October 1 is Tuesday, then July 4 would be Tuesday minus 89 days. Let me calculate 89 days. 89 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 5 days. So subtracting 5 days from Tuesday would be Tuesday minus 5 days, which is Thursday. So July 4 would be a Thursday. But I thought July 4 was a Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between July 4 and October 1. Let me recalculate that. July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since July 4 is day 0, July 5 is day 1, ..., July 31 is day 27). Then August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October 1 is the next day. So total days from July 4 to October 1 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 89 days. Wait, that's correct. So if July 4 is a Monday, then October 1 is 89 days later, which is 12 weeks and 5 days, so Monday + 5 days is Saturday. But according to the other method, October 1 is Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the assumptions is wrong. Let me check the actual date. Wait, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but how can I confirm that? Alternatively, maybe I can check online. Wait, but since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, I can use another approach. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If December 25 is a Sunday, then November 30 is a Thursday. Then October 31 is a Tuesday. Then October 1 is 29 days before that. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day. So if October 31 is a Tuesday, then October 1 is Tuesday minus 1 day, which is Monday. Wait, that's conflicting again. Now I'm getting different results. This is confusing. Maybe I need to find a better way. Let me try to use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So December 31, 2022 is a Saturday. Then November 30, 2022 is a Friday. Then October 31, 2022 is a Thursday. Then October 1 is 30 days before October 31. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if October 31 is a Thursday, then October 1 is Thursday minus 2 days, which is Tuesday. But if I use the July 4 method, I get Saturday. So which is correct? Maybe I made a mistake in the July 4 date. Let me check. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then adding 89 days would be October 1, 2022. But if October 1 is Tuesday, then July 4 would be Tuesday minus 89 days. 89 days is 12 weeks and 5 days. So Tuesday minus 5 days is Thursday. So July 4 would be a Thursday. But I thought it was a Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, maybe my assumption that July 4, 2022 was a Monday is wrong. Let me think. If I can find another date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If July 1, 2022 is a Friday, then July 4 would be a Monday (Friday + 3 days). So that would make July 4 a Monday. Then October 1 would be Saturday. But if October 1 is Saturday, then October 31 would be a Saturday plus 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. So October 31 would be a Monday. But earlier, I thought October 31 was a Thursday. That's conflicting. So now I'm really confused. Maybe I need to find a different approach. Let me use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So December 31, 2022 is a Saturday. Then November 30, 2022 is a Friday. Then October 31, 2022 is a Thursday. Then October 1 is 30 days before that. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if October 31 is a Thursday, then October 1 is Thursday minus 2 days, which is Tuesday. So October 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. But that contradicts the July 4 method. So which is correct? Maybe I need to check another date. For example, I know that September 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Let me check that. If September 1 is a Thursday, then October 1 is 31 days later. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Thursday + 3 days is Sunday. But that would mean October 1 is a Sunday. But that's conflicting with the previous results. Now I'm really confused. I think I need to find a way to resolve this. Maybe I should use the fact that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but how can I be sure? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think. If I can find a reliable way. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, I think I need to recall that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, no, I think that's not right. Let me think. If I can remember that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday (since 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days later is 52 weeks and 1 day, so January 1, 2023 is one day later than January 1, 2022). Therefore, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, let's count the days from January 1, 2022 to October 1, 2022. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and October 1 is the next day. So from January 1 to October 1 is 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 1 (October 1) = Wait, no. Wait, from January 1 to October 1 is 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 1 (October 1)? No, that's not right. Wait, from January 1 to October 1 is 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) = that's the total days from January 1 to September 30. Then October 1 is one day after that. So total days from January 1 to October 1 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 1 = Wait, no. Wait, January 1 to September 30 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) = let's calculate that. 31 + 28 = 59, +31 = 90, +30 = 120, +31 = 151, +30 = 181, +31 = 212, +31 = 243, +30 = 273. So from January 1 to September 30 is 273 days. Then October 1 is 274 days after January 1, 2022. Since January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, adding 274 days. 274 divided by 7 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So Saturday + 1 day is Sunday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. But this contradicts the previous results. Now I'm really confused. I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations. Let me check the total days again. January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30. So adding those up: 31 + 28 = 59, +31 = 90,"], [49, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Wednesday, September 21 to Wednesday, November 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Hmm. First, I should figure out the dates and check which Saturdays are in that range.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The start date is September 21, 2022, which is a Wednesday. The end date is November 30, 2022, also a Wednesday. So the period is from one Wednesday to another Wednesday, which is exactly 12 weeks and 6 days? Wait, no. Wait, let me check the actual number of days between those dates.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7 to find the number of weeks, then adjust for the extra days. But since the start and end dates are both Wednesdays, the total number of days should be a multiple of 7? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, September 21 is a Wednesday. Let's count the days from September 21 to November 30. Let's break it down:\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (including September 21). Then October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. So total days from September 21 to November 30 inclusive would be 10 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 30 (Nov) = 71 days. Wait, but wait, if September 21 is day 1, then September 22 is day 2, etc. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (since 30-21=9, plus 1 for inclusive). Then October is 31 days, November is 30 days. So total days is 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. So the total period is 71 days.\n\nNow, since the start date is a Wednesday, and the end date is also a Wednesday, the total number of days is 71. Let me check if 71 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 1 day. Because 7*10=70, so 71 days is 10 weeks and 1 day. So that means that there are 10 full weeks, and one extra day. Since the start date is a Wednesday, the first day is Wednesday, and the last day is also Wednesday. So in 10 weeks, there are 10 Saturdays. Then the extra day is the 71st day, which is a Wednesday. So that day is not a Saturday. Therefore, the total number of Saturdays would be 10.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because if the total days are 71, and the first day is Wednesday, then the first Saturday would be September 24 (since September 21 is Wednesday, 22 Thu, 23 Fri, 24 Sat). Then each week after that. So in 71 days, how many Saturdays?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of Saturdays by checking each month.\n\nSeptember: From September 21 (Wednesday) to September 30. The Saturdays in September would be September 24 and 31? Wait, September 30 is the end date. Wait, September 21 is Wednesday. So September 24 is Saturday. Then September 24 + 7 days is October 1. Then October has 31 days. So October 1 is a Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, September 24 is Saturday. Then September 25 is Sunday, 26 Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. So October 1 is Saturday. So October has 31 days. So the Saturdays in October would be October 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Saturdays. Then November has 30 days. November 1 is a Monday (since October 31 is a Monday? Wait, October 1 is Saturday, so October 8 is Saturday, then October 15, 22, 29. Then October 31 is a Monday. So November 1 is a Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, October 31 is a Monday. So November 1 is Tuesday. Then the first Saturday in November would be November 4 (since November 1 is Tuesday, 2 Wed, 3 Thu, 4 Fri? Wait, no. Wait, November 1 is Tuesday. So November 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday. So the first Saturday in November is November 5. Then the Saturdays would be 5, 12, 19, 26. That's 4 Saturdays. Then November 30 is a Wednesday. So in November, there are 4 Saturdays. So total Saturdays would be September: 1 (September 24), October: 5, November: 4. Total 1+5+4=10. So that's 10 Saturdays. So the answer is 10.\n\nBut wait, the start date is September 21, which is Wednesday. So September 24 is Saturday. Then the end date is November 30, which is Wednesday. So the last Saturday would be November 26. So that's 10 Saturdays. So the answer is 10. So the final answer is 10.", "10"], [49, "In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3.

I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, but since the question is about a specific year where January 1st is a Tuesday, maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year unless told otherwise. Wait, but actually, the problem doesn't mention leap year, so maybe I should assume it's a common year. Let me check that. If it's a leap year, February would have 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should go with 28 days for February. But wait, maybe the problem is in a leap year? Wait, no, the problem just says \"a year where Tuesday is January 1st\". So maybe it's not specified whether it's a leap year or not. But since the problem is solvable regardless, maybe I can proceed with either assumption. Wait, but if I assume a non-leap year, then February has 28 days. Let me check that.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March has 31 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 3 is 92 days. Wait, but wait, that's from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 92 days? Wait, let me recount. Let's think of it as the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd, inclusive. Wait, no. If I want to find the day of the week for April 3rd, I need to count how many days after January 1st it is. So January 1st is day 0 (Tuesday). Then January 2nd is day 1 (Wednesday), and so on. So April 3rd is the number of days after January 1st. Let me calculate that.\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March has 31 days, adding 31 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 3 is 92. So April 3rd is 92 days after January 1st.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Tuesday, I need to find what day of the week it is 92 days later. Since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can divide 92 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is.\n\nSo 92 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7 times 13 is 91, so 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So the remainder is 1. That means 92 days later is 1 day after Tuesday. So Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday. Therefore, April 3rd would be a Wednesday?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because if January 1st is Tuesday, then adding 7 days would be Tuesday again. So 7 days later is Tuesday, 14 days later is Tuesday, etc. So 91 days later is Tuesday (since 13 weeks is 91 days). Then 92 days later is one day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. So that would be the answer. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. March has 31 days, adding 31 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days. So total is 30 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 92 days. That seems correct. So 92 days later is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Tuesday is Wednesday. Therefore, April 3rd is a Wednesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is Tuesday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So January 1st is Tuesday. Then January 8th is also Tuesday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Tuesday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th, April 2nd. Then April 3rd is one day after April 2nd. So if April 2nd is a Tuesday, then April 3rd is Wednesday. Wait, but according to this, April 2nd is Tuesday. So that would make April 3rd Wednesday. So that matches the previous calculation. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another approach. Let's count the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's use the actual dates.\n\nJanuary 1st is Tuesday. Let's count the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is day 0 (Tuesday). Then January 2nd is day 1 (Wednesday), ..., January 7th is day 6 (Monday), January 8th is day 7 (Tuesday). So every 7 days, the cycle repeats.\n\nSo, for example, January 1st is Tuesday. Then January 8th is Tuesday. Then January 15th is Tuesday, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Tuesday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. April 2nd is Tuesday. Then April 3rd is Wednesday. So that's correct.

First, I should figure out the dates and check which Saturdays are in that range.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. June 30 is a Thursday. Then the end date is September 6, which is a Tuesday. So the period starts on a Thursday and ends on a Tuesday. Now, I need to count all the Saturdays in this interval.\n\nLet me start by checking the first day, June 30, 2022. Since that's a Thursday, the next day, July 1, 2022, would be a Friday. Then July 2 is Saturday. So the first Saturday in the range is July 2, 2022. Then every 7 days after that would be another Saturday. Let me list them out.\n\nJuly 2, 2022 (Saturday)\nJuly 9, 2022 (Saturday)\nJuly 16, 2022 (Saturday)\nJuly 23, 2022 (Saturday)\nJuly 30, 2022 (Saturday)\nAugust 6, 2022 (Saturday)\nAugust 13, 2022 (Saturday)\nAugust 20, 2022 (Saturday)\nAugust 27, 2022 (Saturday)\nSeptember 3, 2022 (Saturday)\nSeptember 10, 2022 (Saturday) \u2013 Wait, but the end date is September 6. So September 10 is after that. So that's not included.\n\nWait, let me check the end date again. The end is September 6, 2022. So September 3 is a Saturday, and then September 10 would be the next one, which is beyond the end date. So the last Saturday in the range is September 3, 2022.\n\nNow, let me count how many Saturdays that is. Starting from July 2:\n\nJuly 2 (1)\nJuly 9 (2)\nJuly 16 (3)\nJuly 23 (4)\nJuly 30 (5)\nAugust 6 (6)\nAugust 13 (7)\nAugust 20 (8)\nAugust 27 (9)\nSeptember 3 (10)\n\nSo that's 10 Saturdays. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any or count extra. Let me check each month.\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 2 to July 30, that's 29 days. Wait, but the first Saturday is July 2, then adding 7 days each time. Let's count the number of Saturdays in July. July has 31 days. The first Saturday is July 2, then 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5 Saturdays in July.\n\nThen August has 31 days. The first Saturday in August is August 6. Then 13, 20, 27. That's 4 Saturdays in August.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. The first Saturday in September is September 3. Then the next would be September 10, which is beyond the end date of September 6.

I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, July 17, 2022, to Tuesday, August 23, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. July 17, 2022 is a Sunday. The end date is August 23, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let me confirm the days of the week for these dates to make sure. July 17 is a Sunday. July 18 is Monday, 19 Tuesday, 20 Wednesday, 21 Thursday, 22 Friday, 23 Saturday, 24 Sunday. Then August 1 is Monday, and so on. August 23 is a Tuesday. So the period starts on a Sunday and ends on a Tuesday.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total number of days between July 17 and August 23, inclusive. Let's break it down by months.\n\nJuly has 31 days. July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 = 14 days, but since we include both start and end dates, it's 14 + 1 = 15 days? Wait, no. Wait, if I start on July 17, then July 17 is day 1, July 18 is day 2, etc. So from July 17 to July 31 inclusive, that's 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total days would be 15 + 23 = 38 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nJuly 17 (Sunday) to July 31: Let's count the days. July 17 is day 1. July 18 is day 2, ..., July 24 is day 8 (since 17 + 7 days is 24, which is a Sunday again). Wait, maybe it's easier to calculate the total days between the two dates. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that here, I need to compute it manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 = 14 days, but since we include both start and end dates, it's 14 + 1 = 15 days. Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total days is 15 + 23 = 38 days. So total days between July 17 and August 23 inclusive is 38 days.\n\nNow, out of these 38 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nLet me list the days of the week for each date. Starting from July 17 (Sunday):\n\nJuly 17: Sunday\nJuly 18: Monday\nJuly 19: Tuesday\nJuly 20: Wednesday\nJuly 21: Thursday\nJuly 22: Friday\nJuly 23: Saturday\nJuly 24: Sunday\nJuly 25: Monday\nJuly 26: Tuesday\nJuly 27: Wednesday\nJuly 28: Thursday\nJuly 29: Friday\nJuly 30: Saturday\nJuly 31: Sunday\n\nSo from July 17 to July 31, the weekends are July 17 (Sunday), July 23 (Saturday), July 24 (Sunday), July 30 (Saturday), July 31 (Sunday). Wait, that's 5 weekends? Wait, let me count again:\n\nJuly 17: Sunday (1)\nJuly 23: Saturday (2)\nJuly 24: Sunday (3)\nJuly 30: Saturday (4)\nJuly 31: Sunday (5). So that's 5 weekend days in July.\n\nThen in August, starting from August 1 (Monday) to August 23 (Tuesday). Let's list the weekends in August:\n\nAugust 1 is Monday, so the first weekend is August 2 (Tuesday?), no. Wait, August 1 is Monday. So the first weekend would be August 2 (Tuesday?), no. Wait, weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So August 1 is Monday, August 2 is Tuesday, August 3 is Wednesday, August 4 is Thursday, August 5 is Friday, August 6 is Saturday (weekend), August 7 is Sunday (weekend), August 8 is Monday, and so on.\n\nSo in August, the weekends would be August 6 (Saturday), August 7 (Sunday), August 13 (Saturday), August 14 (Sunday), August 20 (Saturday), August 21 (Sunday), August 27 (Saturday), August 28 (Sunday). But our end date is August 23, so we need to check up to August 23.\n\nSo in August, from August 1 to August 23, the weekends are August 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21. That's 6 weekend days. Wait, August 20 is Saturday, August 21 is Sunday. August 22 is Monday, August 23 is Tuesday. So yes, those are the weekends in August.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period are 5 (July) + 6 (August) = 11 weekend days.\n\nTherefore, the total business days would be total days (38) minus weekend days (11) = 27 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the total days. Let me verify the total days again.\n\nJuly 17 to July 31 inclusive: July has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total is 15 + 23 = 38 days. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the weekends in July: July 17 (Sunday), July 23 (Saturday), July 24 (Sunday), July 30 (Saturday), July 31 (Sunday). That's 5 days. Then in August, August 6 (Saturday), August 7 (Sunday), August 13 (Saturday), August 14 (Sunday), August 20 (Saturday), August 21 (Sunday). That's 6 days. So total 11 weekend days. So 38 - 11 = 27 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check if August 23 is included. The end date is August 23, which is a Tuesday. So in August, the weekends up to August 23 are August 6,7,13,14,20,21. That's 6 days. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the business days directly. Let's try that approach.\n\nStarting from July 17 (Sunday), which is not a business day. Then July 18 (Monday) is business. July 19 (Tuesday), July 20 (Wednesday), July 21 (Thursday), July 22 (Friday). Then July 23 (Saturday) is not, July 24 (Sunday) not. July 25 (Monday) is business. July 26 (Tuesday), July 27 (Wednesday), July 28 (Thursday), July 29 (Friday). July 30 (Saturday) not, July 31 (Sunday) not. Then August 1 (Monday) business, August 2 (Tuesday), August 3 (Wednesday), August 4 (Thursday), August 5 (Friday). August 6 (Saturday) not, August 7 (Sunday) not. August 8 (Monday), August 9 (Tuesday), August 10 (Wednesday), August 11 (Thursday), August 12 (Friday). August 13 (Saturday) not, August 14 (Sunday) not. August 15 (Monday), August 16 (Tuesday), August 17 (Wednesday), August 18 (Thursday), August 19 (Friday). August 20 (Saturday) not, August 21 (Sunday) not. August 22 (Monday), August 23 (Tuesday). \n\nNow, let's count all the business days:\n\nJuly 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 (5 days)\nJuly 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 (5 days)\nAugust 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (5 days)\nAugust 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (5 days)\nAugust 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (5 days)\nAugust 22, 23 (2 days)\n\nAdding those up: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 27 days. So that matches the previous calculation.

So I need to figure out all the Tuesdays in that time frame.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week May 18, 2022, was. Wait, the problem says that the start date is Wednesday, May 18. So that's a Wednesday. Then the end date is Friday, June 3. So the period includes both dates.\n\nNow, I need to count all the Tuesdays from May 18 (Wednesday) up to June 3 (Friday). Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can list out the dates and check which ones are Tuesdays. But since I don't have a calendar in front of me, I need to calculate it step by step.\n\nStarting with May 18, 2022, which is a Wednesday. So the next day, May 19 is Thursday, May 20 is Friday, May 21 is Saturday, May 22 is Sunday, May 23 is Monday, May 24 is Tuesday. So the first Tuesday after May 18 is May 24. Then each week after that would have another Tuesday. Let me check how many weeks are in the period.\n\nThe total number of days from May 18 to June 3 inclusive. Let's calculate that. May has 31 days. So from May 18 to May 31 is 31 - 18 = 13 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to add 1? Wait, no. Let me think again. From May 18 to May 19 is 2 days (including both). So from May 18 to May 31 is 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total days is 14 + 3 = 17 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, May 18 to May 19 is 2 days. So May 18 to May 31 is 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total is 14 + 3 = 17 days. So the total period is 17 days.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. Let's count the days between May 18 and June 3 inclusive. Let's see:\n\nMay has 31 days. So May 18 to May 31 is 31 - 18 = 13 days, but since we include both start and end, it's 13 + 1 = 14 days. Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total is 14 + 3 = 17 days. So the total number of days is 17.\n\nNow, since the first day is Wednesday, May 18, and the last day is Friday, June 3. So the days of the week would go from Wednesday to Friday over 17 days. Now, how many Tuesdays are in there?\n\nLet me list the days:\n\nMay 18: Wednesday\n\nMay 19: Thursday\n\nMay 20: Friday\n\nMay 21: Saturday\n\nMay 22: Sunday\n\nMay 23: Monday\n\nMay 24: Tuesday (first Tuesday)\n\nMay 25: Wednesday\n\nMay 26: Thursday\n\nMay 27: Friday\n\nMay 28: Saturday\n\nMay 29: Sunday\n\nMay 30: Monday\n\nMay 31: Tuesday (second Tuesday)\n\nJune 1: Wednesday\n\nJune 2: Thursday\n\nJune 3: Friday\n\nSo that's two Tuesdays: May 24 and May 31. Wait, but that's only two. But wait, let me check again. Let me count each day step by step.\n\nStarting from May 18 (Wednesday):\n\n1. May 18: Wed\n\n2. May 19: Thu\n\n3. May 20: Fri\n\n4.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check if May 31 is indeed a Tuesday. Since May 18 is Wednesday, adding 13 days (May 18 + 13 days is May 31). 13 days later. Since 7 days is a week, 13 divided by 7 is 1 week and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Wednesday: Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. So yes, May 31 is a Tuesday.

But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates.\n\nStarting with April 24, 2022. Let me confirm what day that was. Wait, the problem says it's a Sunday. So April 24 is a Sunday. Then the next day, April 25 is a Monday. So the first day is a Sunday, which is a weekend. So the first day is excluded from weekdays. The end date is June 24, which is a Friday. So that's included.\n\nSo I need to count all the days from April 24 to June 24, inclusive, and then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. Alternatively, count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.\n\nAlternatively, maybe calculate the total days between the two dates, then subtract the number of weekends. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days from April 24 to June 24, inclusive. Let's break it down.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30 is 30 - 24 + 1 = 7 days. Wait, April 24 is day 1, April 25 is day 2, ..., April 30 is day 7. Then May has 31 days, so May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days would be 7 (April) + 31 (May) + 24 (June) = 62 days. Wait, but wait, April 24 to April 30 is 7 days, then May is 31 days, then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. But wait, if the start date is April 24 and end date is June 24, inclusive, then that's correct. Let me check with another method. Let's count the days between April 24 and June 24.\n\nAlternatively, using a calendar. But maybe I can use the fact that April 24 is a Sunday. Let me check the days of the week for each month.\n\nApril 24 is Sunday. Then April 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So April 24 to April 30 is 7 days, with April 24 being Sunday and April 30 being Saturday. Then May has 31 days. May 1 is a Sunday (since April 30 is Saturday, so May 1 is Sunday). Wait, no. Wait, April 30 is Saturday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, etc. So May has 31 days. Let me check how many weekends are in May. May 1 is Sunday, so the weekends in May are Sundays and Saturdays. So May has 5 weeks and 1 day. Wait, 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, ..., May 7 is Saturday. Then May 8 is Sunday again. So the weekends in May would be Sundays (May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29) and Saturdays (May 7, 14, 21, 28). So that's 5 Sundays and 4 Saturdays? Wait, May has 31 days. Let me count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in May.\n\nMay 1 is Sunday. So the first Sunday is May 1. Then the next Sundays are May 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Sundays. Then the Saturdays would be May 7, 14, 21, 28. That's 4 Saturdays. So total weekends in May are 5 + 4 = 9 days.\n\nThen June 1 is a Monday (since May 31 is a Friday, because May 31 is the last day of May. Wait, May 31 is a Friday? Let me check. May 1 is Sunday. May 7 is Saturday. May 8 is Sunday. So May 31 is 31 days later. Let's calculate May 31's day of the week. May 1 is Sunday. May 7 is Saturday. May 8 is Sunday. So each week is 7 days. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So May 1 + 4 weeks is May 29, which is Sunday. Then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. Then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So May 31 is a Tuesday. Therefore, June 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's recalculate. If May 1 is Sunday, then:\n\nMay 1: Sunday\n\nMay 2: Monday\n\nMay 3: Tuesday\n\nMay 4: Wednesday\n\nMay 5: Thursday\n\nMay 6: Friday\n\nMay 7: Saturday\n\nMay 8: Sunday\n\nSo May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. Then May 14 is Saturday, May 21 is Saturday, May 28 is Saturday. Then May 31 is Tuesday. Because May 28 is Saturday, May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. Therefore, June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Wednesday, June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday, June 5 is Sunday, etc.\n\nSo the end date is June 24, which is a Friday. Let me check that. June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Wednesday, June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday, June 5 is Sunday, June 6 is Monday, June 7 is Tuesday, June 8 is Wednesday, and so on. Let's count the days in June. June has 30 days. So June 1 is Wednesday, June 24 is 24 days later. Let's calculate the day of the week for June 24. Since June 1 is Wednesday, adding 23 days (since June 1 is day 0, June 24 is day 23). 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. So June 24 is a Friday. That matches the problem statement.\n\nNow, back to counting the weekends. So from April 24 (Sunday) to June 24 (Friday). Let's break it down into each month.\n\nFirst, April: April 24 is Sunday, April 25 is Monday, ..., April 30 is Saturday. So in April, the weekends are April 24 (Sunday) and April 25 is Monday, so the weekends in April are April 24 (Sunday) and April 30 (Saturday). Wait, April 24 is Sunday, April 25 is Monday, April 26 is Tuesday, April 27 is Wednesday, April 28 is Thursday, April 29 is Friday, April 30 is Saturday. So in April, there are two weekends: April 24 (Sunday) and April 30 (Saturday). So that's 2 weekend days in April.\n\nThen May: as calculated earlier, there are 5 Sundays and 4 Saturdays, totaling 9 weekend days.\n\nThen June: June 1 is Wednesday, so the first weekend in June is June 4 (Saturday) and June 5 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is June 11 (Saturday), June 12 (Sunday), then June 18 (Saturday), June 19 (Sunday), then June 25 (Saturday), June 26 (Sunday). But the end date is June 24, which is a Friday. So in June, the weekends that fall within the period are June 4 (Saturday), June 5 (Sunday), June 11 (Saturday), June 12 (Sunday), June 18 (Saturday), June 19 (Sunday). That's 6 weekend days in June. Wait, June 25 is Saturday, but June 24 is Friday, so that's not included. So in June, from June 1 to June 24, there are 6 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period: April (2) + May (9) + June (6) = 17 weekend days.\n\nTotal days from April 24 to June 24 inclusive is 62 days (as calculated earlier). So the number of weekdays would be 62 - 17 = 45. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, 62 total days minus 17 weekends equals 45 weekdays. But let me verify this with another approach to make sure.\n\nAlternative approach: count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between April 24 and June 24.\n\nStarting with April 24 (Sunday). So the first weekday is April 25 (Monday). Let's count each weekday.\n\nApril:\n\nApril 25 (Monday)\n\nApril 26 (Tuesday)\n\nApril 27 (Wednesday)\n\nApril 28 (Thursday)\n\nApril 29 (Friday)\n\nApril 30 (Saturday) \u2013 weekend\n\nSo in April, from April 24 to April 30, the weekdays are April 25-29 (5 days).\n\nThen May:\n\nMay 1 is Sunday, so May 2 is Monday. May has 31 days. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays in May.\n\nMay 1 is Sunday, so May 2 is Monday. The Mondays in May are May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5 Mondays). Tuesdays: May 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 (5 Tuesdays). Wednesdays: May 4, 11, 18, 25 (4 Wednesdays). Thursdays: May 5, 12, 19, 26 (4 Thursdays). Fridays: May 6, 13, 20, 27 (4 Fridays). Wait, but May has 31 days. Let me check again. May 31 is Tuesday. So the last Friday in May is May 27. Then May 28 is Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. So in May, the number of weekdays is:\n\nMondays: 5 (2,9,16,23,30)\n\nTuesdays: 5 (3,10,17,24,31)\n\nWednesdays: 4 (4,11,18,25)\n\nThursdays: 4 (5,12,19,26)\n\nFridays: 4 (6,13,20,27)\n\nTotal weekdays in May: 5+5+4+4+4 = 22 days.\n\nThen June:\n\nJune 1 is Wednesday. So the first weekday is June 1 (Wednesday). Let's count the weekdays in June up to June 24.\n\nJune 1 (Wednesday), 2 (Thursday), 3 (Friday), 4 (Saturday), 5 (Sunday), 6 (Monday), 7 (Tuesday), 8 (Wednesday), 9 (Thursday), 10 (Friday), 11 (Saturday), 12 (Sunday), 13 (Monday), 14 (Tuesday), 15 (Wednesday), 16 (Thursday), 17 (Friday), 18 (Saturday), 19 (Sunday), 20 (Monday), 21 (Tuesday), 22 (Wednesday), 23 (Thursday), 24 (Friday).\n\nSo from June 1 to June 24, the weekdays are:\n\nWednesdays: June 1, 8, 15, 22 (4 days)\n\nThursdays: June 2, 9, 16, 23 (4 days)\n\nFridays: June 3, 10, 17, 24 (4 days)\n\nMondays: June 6, 13, 20 (3 days)\n\nTuesdays: June 7, 14, 21 (3 days)\n\nSo total weekdays in June: 4+4+4+3+3 = 18 days.\n\nSo total weekdays in the entire period: April (5) + May (22) + June (18) = 45 days. That matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 45.", "45"], [49, "If today is Wednesday, March 30, 2022, what day of the week was it 2 days ago?

And they want the complete weekday name, so I need to make sure I use the full name like \"Wednesday\" instead of just \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what day it was two days before Wednesday.

Subtract one day: Tuesday. Subtract another day: Monday. Yeah, that seems correct. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify with a calendar or some other method to be sure. Let me think. March 30, 2022, is a Wednesday. Let me check what day March 29 was. If March 30 is Wednesday, then March 29 would be Tuesday. Then March 28 would be Monday. So two days ago from March 30 would be March 28, which is Monday. That matches my previous conclusion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 30 is a Wednesday.

Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what day of the week it was 56 days ago, given that today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022. Hmm, I need to figure out how to calculate that.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 56 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that: 56 divided by 7 is 8. Oh, so 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. That means 56 days ago would be the same day of the week as today. But wait, if today is Tuesday, then 56 days ago would also be a Tuesday? But wait, maybe I need to check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, February 8, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, but maybe I should check if the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count backward. Let's try subtracting 7 days multiple times. Starting from February 8, 2022, subtract 7 days: February 1st, 2022. That's a Tuesday. Then subtract another 7 days: January 25, 2022. Also a Tuesday. Then January 18, 2022. Tuesday again. Then January 11, 2022. Tuesday. Then January 4, 2022. Tuesday. Then December 28, 2021. Tuesday. Then December 21, 2021. Tuesday. Then December 14, 2021. Tuesday. Wait, that's 8 times 7 days, which is 56 days. So 56 days ago would be December 14, 2021, which is a Tuesday. But wait, the question says today is February 8, 2022. So if I go back 56 days, that's exactly 8 weeks, so same day of the week. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any error in my calculation. Let me think again. If today is Tuesday, then 7 days ago was also Tuesday. So 56 days ago is 8 times that, so same day. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let me use another approach. Let's calculate the date 56 days before February 8, 2022. Let's count backwards. February has 28 days in 2022 (since 2022 is not a leap year). So February 8 minus 56 days. Let's subtract 28 days first: February 8 minus 28 days is December 29, 2021. Wait, no. Wait, February 8 minus 28 days would be November 10, 2021? Wait, maybe I should break it down step by step. Let me think. Let's subtract 28 days from February 8, 2022. February has 28 days, so subtracting 28 days would take us back to January 1, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, February 8 minus 28 days: February 8 minus 28 days is November 29, 2021? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I should use a calendar. But since I can't do that, maybe I can use the fact that 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. So regardless of the date, 56 days ago would be the same day of the week. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any error in the assumption. For example, if the date is in a month with different days. But since 56 days is exactly 8 weeks, regardless of the month, the day of the week would be the same. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [49, "Tell me whether 1999 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1999 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 1999. First, divide 1999 by 4. Let me do the division: 4 times 499 is 1996, so 1999 minus 1996 is 3. That means 1999 divided by 4 is 499.75, which isn't a whole number. So 1999 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me add 4 to 1996 to get 2000, which is a leap year. So 1999 is one year before that, so it's not divisible by 4.

Write the total number.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many Tuesdays there are from Sunday, September 18, 2022, to Tuesday, November 15, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. Alright, first, maybe I should check what day of the week each of these dates falls on to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Wait, the problem already says that the start date is a Sunday and the end date is a Tuesday. So that's helpful.\n\nSo the range starts on a Sunday and ends on a Tuesday. Let me think about the days in between. Let's break it down month by month. September, October, and November. \n\nFirst, September. The start date is September 18, 2022. Let me check what day that is. Wait, the problem says it's a Sunday. So September 18 is a Sunday. Then the next day, September 19 is a Monday, 20 is Tuesday, 21 is Wednesday, 22 is Thursday, 23 is Friday, 24 is Saturday, 25 is Sunday, 26 is Monday, 27 is Tuesday, 28 is Wednesday, 29 is Thursday, 30 is Friday, 31 is Saturday. Wait, September has 30 days, right? So September 30 is a Saturday. Then October 1 is a Sunday. \n\nSo in September, the Tuesdays would be the 20th, 27th. Let me count: September 18 is Sunday, so adding 2 days gets to Tuesday, September 20. Then the next Tuesday would be September 27. Then October 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th, and November 1st, 8th, 15th. Wait, but the end date is November 15, which is a Tuesday. So I need to include that.\n\nWait, let me check each month step by step. \n\nStarting with September. From September 18 (Sunday) to September 30 (Saturday). So the Tuesdays in September are 20th and 27th. That's two Tuesdays.\n\nThen October. October 1 is a Sunday. So the Tuesdays in October would be the 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, and 30th. Wait, October has 31 days. So October 31 is a Monday. So that's five Tuesdays in October.\n\nThen November. November 1 is a Tuesday (since October 31 is a Monday, so November 1 is Tuesday). Then the Tuesdays in November would be 1st, 8th, 15th. Wait, the end date is November 15, which is a Tuesday. So that's three Tuesdays in November.\n\nSo adding them up: 2 (September) + 5 (October) + 3 (November) = 10 Tuesdays. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any days or count incorrectly.\n\nLet me list all the Tuesdays:\n\nSeptember: 20, 27.\n\nOctober: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30.\n\nNovember: 1, 8, 15.\n\nThat's 2 + 5 + 3 = 10. But wait, the start date is September 18 (Sunday), so the first Tuesday is September 20. The last date is November 15 (Tuesday). So that's correct. So total of 10 Tuesdays. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should check if there's any other Tuesday in September or October that I missed. Let me check again.\n\nSeptember 18 is Sunday. So the next Tuesday is 20th. Then 27th. Then October 2nd (since October 1 is Sunday). Then 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th. Then November 1st, 8th, 15th. Yes, that's 2 + 5 + 3 = 10. So the answer should be 10. But wait, maybe I should check the actual dates to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the dates and then divide by 7, but that might not be accurate because of the starting and ending days. But since the start is a Sunday and the end is a Tuesday, maybe that's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of weeks. From September 18 to November 15. Let's calculate the total days. September has 30 days, so from September 18 to September 30 is 13 days (including September 18). Then October has 31 days, and November 15 is 15 days. So total days is 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. Wait, but that's from September 18 to November 15 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on September 18, then September 18 is day 1, September 19 is day 2, etc. So the total number of days from September 18 to November 15 inclusive is (November 15 - September 18) + 1. Let me calculate that.\n\nSeptember 18 to September 30 is 13 days (30 - 18 + 1 = 13). Then October has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then November 1 to November 15 is 15 days. So total is 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. So 59 days in total. Now, 59 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 3 days. So that would mean 8 full weeks (56 days) plus 3 days. Since the first day is a Sunday, the first 56 days would include 8 Tuesdays (since each week has one Tuesday). Then the remaining 3 days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So that would add one more Tuesday. So total of 8 + 1 = 9 Tuesdays. Wait, but this contradicts my previous count of 10. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. So I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check again.\n\nFirst method: listing the Tuesdays. September 20, 27 (2), October 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5), November 1, 8, 15 (3). Total 10. Second method: total days 59, 59/7 is 8 weeks and 3 days. So 8*1 + 1 = 9. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the total days calculation. Let me check the actual dates. Let's count the days from September 18 to November 15 inclusive.\n\nSeptember 18 is day 1. September 19 is day 2. ... September 20 is day 3. Wait, no. Wait, if September 18 is day 1, then September 19 is day 2, and so on. So September 18 to September 30 is 13 days (30 - 18 + 1 = 13). Then October has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then November 1 to November 15 is 15 days. So total is 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. So that's correct. So 59 days. Now, if the first day is a Sunday, then the days of the week would be:\n\nDay 1: Sunday (Sep 18)\n\nDay 2: Monday\n\nDay 3: Tuesday (Sep 20)\n\nDay 4: Wednesday\n\nDay 5: Thursday\n\nDay 6: Friday\n\nDay 7: Saturday\n\nDay 8: Sunday\n\nDay 9: Monday\n\nDay 10: Tuesday (Sep 27)\n\nAnd so on. So every 7 days, the same day of the week repeats. So in 56 days (8 weeks), there would be 8 Tuesdays. Then the remaining 3 days (days 57, 58, 59) would be:\n\nDay 57: Sunday (Sep 18 + 56 days is Sep 18 + 56 days. Let's check: 56 days is 8 weeks. So Sep 18 + 56 days is Sep 18 + 56 days. September has 30 days, so 30 - 18 = 12 days left in September. 56 - 12 = 44 days into October. October has 31 days, so 44 - 31 = 13 days into November. November 13 is a Sunday. So day 57 is Sunday. Then day 58 is Monday, day 59 is Tuesday. So the last day is Tuesday, which is day 59. So in the remaining 3 days, there is one Tuesday (day 59). So total Tuesdays would be 8 + 1 = 9. But according to the first method, there are 10. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the first method is wrong. Let me list all the Tuesdays again. Let's check each month.\n\nSeptember: 20, 27. That's two.\n\nOctober: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five.\n\nNovember: 1, 8, 15. That's three. Total 10. But according to the second method, it's 9. So there's a conflict here. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the total days calculation is wrong. Let me check the actual dates. Let's check the day of the week for November 15. The problem says that the end date is Tuesday, November 15. So that's correct. So if the first day is Sunday, September 18, then the last day is Tuesday, November 15. So the total number of days is 59. So 59 days. Now, if I count the number of Tuesdays, according to the first method, there are 10. But according to the second method, 9. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first method. Let me check the dates again. Let's list all the Tuesdays:\n\nSeptember 20 (Tuesday), 27 (Tuesday). That's two.\n\nOctober 2 (Tuesday), 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five.\n\nNovember 1 (Tuesday), 8, 15. That's three. Total 10. But according to the second method, there should be 9. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 59. Let me check again. Let's count the days from September 18 to November 15 inclusive.\n\nSeptember 18 is day 1.\n\nSeptember 19 is day 2.\n\n...\n\nSeptember 30 is day 13 (since 30 - 18 + 1 = 13).\n\nOctober 1 is day 14.\n\nOctober 2 is day 15.\n\n...\n\nOctober 31 is day 14 + 30 = day 44 (since October has 31 days, so day 14 + 31 = day 45? Wait, no. Wait, September has 30 days. So September 18 is day 1. September 19 is day 2. ... September 30 is day 13. Then October 1 is day 14. October 2 is day 15. October 31 is day 14 + 30 = day 44? Wait, no. Wait, October has 31 days. So from day 14 (October 1) to day 14 + 31 - 1 = day 44 (October 31). So October 31 is day 44. Then November 1 is day 45. November 15 is day 45 + 14 = day 59. So that's correct. So 59 days. So the total days is 59. So according to the second method, there are 8 full weeks (56 days) and 3 days. So 8 Tuesdays in the full weeks, plus one more in the remaining 3 days. So 9 Tuesdays. But according to the first method, there are 10. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the first method. Let me check the dates again. Let's check the first Tuesday in September: September 20. Then the next Tuesday is September 27. That's two. Then October 2 is the next Tuesday. Then October 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five. Then November 1, 8, 15. That's three. So 2+5+3=10. But according to the second method, it's 9. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the first day is not a Sunday. Wait, the problem says that the start date is Sunday, September 18, 2022. Let me check that. Let me check an actual calendar. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can recall that September 18, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me confirm. For example, September 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Then September 1 + 17 days is September 18. 17 days later. 17 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 3 days. So Thursday + 3 days is Sunday. Yes, that's correct. So September 18 is a Sunday. Then September 20 is a Tuesday. So that's correct. Then September 27 is the next Tuesday. Then October 2 is the next Tuesday. So that's correct. Then October 9, 16, 23, 30. Then November 1, 8, 15. So that's 10 Tuesdays. But according to the total days calculation, there should be 9. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the total days calculation is wrong. Let me check the number of days again. From September 18 to November 15 inclusive. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nSeptember 18 to September 30: 30 - 18 + 1 = 13 days.\n\nOctober has 31 days.\n\nNovember 1 to November 15: 15 days.\n\nTotal: 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. That's correct.\n\nNow, if the first day is Sunday (day 1), then the days of the week for each day would be:\n\nDay 1: Sunday\n\nDay 2: Monday\n\nDay 3: Tuesday\n\nDay 4: Wednesday\n\nDay 5: Thursday\n\nDay 6: Friday\n\nDay 7: Saturday\n\nDay 8: Sunday\n\nDay 9: Monday\n\nDay 10: Tuesday\n\nDay 11: Wednesday\n\nDay 12: Thursday\n\nDay 13: Friday\n\nDay 14: Saturday\n\nDay 15: Sunday\n\nDay 16: Monday\n\nDay 17: Tuesday\n\nDay 18: Wednesday\n\nDay 19: Thursday\n\nDay 20: Friday\n\nDay 21: Saturday\n\nDay 22: Sunday\n\nDay 23: Monday\n\nDay 24: Tuesday\n\nDay 25: Wednesday\n\nDay 26: Thursday\n\nDay 27: Friday\n\nDay 28: Saturday\n\nDay 29: Sunday\n\nDay 30: Monday\n\nDay 31: Tuesday\n\nDay 32: Wednesday\n\nDay 33: Thursday\n\nDay 34: Friday\n\nDay 35: Saturday\n\nDay 36: Sunday\n\nDay 37: Monday\n\nDay 38: Tuesday\n\nDay 39: Wednesday\n\nDay 40: Thursday\n\nDay 41: Friday\n\nDay 42: Saturday\n\nDay 43: Sunday\n\nDay 44: Monday\n\nDay 45: Tuesday\n\nDay 46: Wednesday\n\nDay 47: Thursday\n\nDay 48: Friday\n\nDay 49: Saturday\n\nDay 50: Sunday\n\nDay 51: Monday\n\nDay 52: Tuesday\n\nDay 53: Wednesday\n\nDay 54: Thursday\n\nDay 55: Friday\n\nDay 56: Saturday\n\nDay 57: Sunday\n\nDay 58: Monday\n\nDay 59: Tuesday\n\nSo according to this list, the Tuesdays are on days 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59. That's 9 Tuesdays. Wait, but according to my previous count, I had 10. So where is the mistake?\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nDay 3: Tuesday (Sep 20)\n\nDay 10: Tuesday (Sep 27)\n\nDay 17: Tuesday (Oct 2)\n\nDay 24: Tuesday (Oct 9)\n\nDay 31: Tuesday (Oct 16)\n\nDay 38: Tuesday (Oct 23)\n\nDay 45: Tuesday (Oct 30)\n\nDay 52: Tuesday (Nov 1)\n\nDay 59: Tuesday (Nov 15)\n\nSo that's 9 Tuesdays. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 10. So where did I go wrong in the first method? Let me check again.\n\nIn my first method, I listed September 20, 27 (2), October 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5), November 1, 8, 15 (3). That's 2+5+3=10.

If it doesn't exist, I should answer -1. Wait, but November has 30 days, so there must be a Saturday. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. I remember that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. Wait, maybe I can use some reference dates. Alternatively, I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, no, maybe I should use a different approach. Let me think about the days. Let's start from a known date. For example, I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Wait, but that's December. Maybe I can work backwards.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me count the days. Let's see, November has 30 days.

Let me think. If I remember correctly, November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Wait, but I need to confirm that. Let me try to calculate it.\n\nStarting from January 1, 2022, which was a Sunday. Let's count the days for each month up to November. January has 31 days, so February 1, 2022, was a Monday (since 31 days later is 31 mod 7 = 3 days later, so Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is Sunday. January has 31 days, so January 31 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 31, 2022, was a Wednesday. Then February 1, 2022, was a Thursday. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so March 1, 2022, was a Thursday + 28 days. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1, 2022, was also a Thursday. March has 31 days, so April 1, 2022, was a Thursday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Thursday + 3 days is Sunday. April 1, 2022, was a Sunday. April has 30 days, so May 1, 2022, was Sunday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. May 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. May has 31 days, so June 1, 2022, was Tuesday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. June 1, 2022, was a Friday. June has 30 days, so July 1, 2022, was Friday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Friday + 2 days is Sunday. July 1, 2022, was a Sunday. July has 31 days, so August 1, 2022, was Sunday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. August 1, 2022, was a Wednesday. August has 31 days, so September 1, 2022, was Wednesday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. September 1, 2022, was a Saturday. September has 30 days, so October 1, 2022, was Saturday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Saturday + 2 days is Monday. October 1, 2022, was a Monday. October has 31 days, so November 1, 2022, was Monday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Monday + 3 days is Thursday. Wait, that would mean November 1, 2022, was a Thursday. But I thought earlier that November 4 was a Friday. Let me check that again.\n\nIf November 1 is Thursday, then November 2 is Friday, November 3 is Saturday, November 4 is Sunday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me retrace the steps.\n\nStarting from January 1, 2022: Sunday.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. 31 days later is 31 mod 7 = 3. So January 31 is Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. Then February 1 is Thursday. February has 28 days, so March 1 is Thursday + 28 days = Thursday (since 28 is 4 weeks). March has 31 days, so April 1 is Thursday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Thursday + 3 days is Sunday. April 1 is Sunday. April has 30 days, so May 1 is Sunday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. May 1 is Tuesday. May has 31 days, so June 1 is Tuesday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. June 1 is Friday. June has 30 days, so July 1 is Friday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Friday + 2 days is Sunday. July 1 is Sunday. July has 31 days, so August 1 is Sunday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. August 1 is Wednesday. August has 31 days, so September 1 is Wednesday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. September 1 is Saturday. September has 30 days, so October 1 is Saturday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Saturday + 2 days is Monday. October 1 is Monday. October has 31 days, so November 1 is Monday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Monday + 3 days is Thursday. So November 1, 2022, is a Thursday. Therefore, November 2 is Friday, November 3 is Saturday. So the first Saturday in November is the 3rd. Then the next Saturdays would be 10th, 17th, 24th, and 31st. Wait, November has 30 days, so the last day is the 30th. Therefore, the last Saturday would be the 24th? Wait, no. Let me count. If November 3 is Saturday, then adding 7 days: 3 + 7 = 10, 17, 24, 31. But November only has 30 days, so 31st doesn't exist. Therefore, the last Saturday is the 24th. Wait, but that would mean the 24th is a Saturday. Let me check again. If November 3 is Saturday, then November 10 is Saturday (3+7), 17, 24, and then 24 +7 = 31, which is beyond 30. So the last Saturday is the 24th. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for November 1. Let me check another way. Let me check an actual calendar. Wait, I can't access the internet, but maybe I can use another method. For example, I know that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. If November 3 is Saturday, then November 4 is Sunday. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, if November 3 is Saturday, then November 4 is Sunday. But I thought earlier that November 4 was a Friday. That can't be. So there's a mistake here. Where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me recheck the calculation for November 1. Let's start again. January 1, 2022, is Sunday. January has 31 days. So January 31 is Sunday + 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So January 31 is Wednesday. Then February 1 is Thursday. February has 28 days, so March 1 is Thursday. March has 31 days, so April 1 is Thursday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Thursday + 3 days is Sunday. April 1 is Sunday. April has 30 days, so May 1 is Sunday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. May 1 is Tuesday. May has 31 days, so June 1 is Tuesday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. June 1 is Friday. June has 30 days, so July 1 is Friday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Friday + 2 days is Sunday. July 1 is Sunday. July has 31 days, so August 1 is Sunday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. August 1 is Wednesday. August has 31 days, so September 1 is Wednesday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. September 1 is Saturday. September has 30 days, so October 1 is Saturday + 30 days. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Saturday + 2 days is Monday. October 1 is Monday. October has 31 days, so November 1 is Monday + 31 days. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Monday + 3 days is Thursday. So November 1 is Thursday. Therefore, November 2 is Friday, November 3 is Saturday. Then November 4 is Sunday. So if November 4 is Sunday, then November 5 is Monday, and so on. Wait, but I thought earlier that November 4 was a Friday. That must have been a mistake. So the correct day for November 4 is Sunday. Therefore, the first Saturday is the 3rd, then 10th, 17th, 24th, and the next would be 31st, which doesn't exist. So the last Saturday is the 24th. Therefore, the answer should be 24. But I need to confirm again. Let me check the days again. If November 3 is Saturday, then November 10 is Saturday (3+7), 17, 24, and then 31. Since November has 30 days, the last Saturday is the 24th. So the answer is 24.", "24"], [49, "In a year where Monday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the weekday of March 3rd in a year where January 1st is a Monday. I need to figure out what day of the week that falls on.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 3rd. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think we can assume it's a common year with 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days into March.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to March 3rd would be 31 (days in January) minus 1 (since we start on January 1st) plus 28 (days in February) plus 3 (days in March up to the 3rd). Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So to get the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd, I need to calculate the total days from January 1st to March 3rd inclusive? Or exclusive?\n\nWait, the problem says \"in a year where Monday is January 1st\", so January 1st is a Monday. Then March 3rd is some number of days later. So I need to count how many days are between January 1st and March 3rd, then find the weekday by adding that number of days to Monday.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 30 (January) + 28 (February) + 3 (March) = 61 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31, and February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59, March 2nd is day 60, March 3rd is day 61. So March 3rd is 61 days after January 1st.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Monday, adding 61 days to that. But since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can compute 61 divided by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is.\n\nSo 61 divided by 7 is 8 weeks (56 days) with a remainder of 5 days. Because 7*8=56, 61-56=5. So 5 days after Monday.\n\nMonday + 5 days is Saturday. Wait, Monday + 1 is Tuesday, +2 Wednesday, +3 Thursday, +4 Friday, +5 Saturday. So March 3rd would be a Saturday?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 30 + 28 + 3 = 61 days. So that's correct. 61 days later.\n\n61 divided by 7 is 8*7=56, remainder 5. So 5 days after Monday. So Monday + 5 days is Saturday. So the answer should be Saturday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is Monday. Let's count the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Monday. Then January 8th is also Monday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is the next Monday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is the next Monday. So March 5th is a Monday. Then March 3rd is two days before March 5th. So March 5th is Monday, March 4th is Sunday, March 3rd is Saturday. That matches the previous calculation.

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the dates involved. Let me check the dates. October 11, 2022 is a Tuesday. Then October 12 is Wednesday, 13 is Thursday, 14 is Friday, 15 is Saturday, 16 is Sunday, 17 is Monday, 18 is Tuesday, 19 is Wednesday, 20 is Thursday.

The problem is: In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, what day of the week is March 11th? And I need to answer with the full weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 11th. Let me break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is the starting point). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question just says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So I need to assume it's a common year unless told otherwise. Wait, but maybe the leap year is determined by the fact that January 1st is a Wednesday. Wait, no. Wait, leap years are determined by the year's divisibility by 4, but since the problem doesn't mention anything about the year, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year. But maybe not. Wait, but if the year is a leap year, then February would have 29 days. However, since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check if the year is a leap year based on the given information. Wait, but how? Because if January 1st is a Wednesday, that doesn't necessarily tell me if it's a leap year. Wait, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check. Let's assume it's a non-leap year first. So February has 28 days. Then March 11th would be 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 11 (March) days? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days from January 1st to March 11th is (31 - 1) days in January (since January 1st is day 0?), plus 28 days in February, plus 11 days in March. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So the total number of days from January 1st to March 11th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 11? Wait, no. Wait, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 11th is 11 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 30 (January) + 28 (February) + 11 (March) = 69 days? Wait, but that would be 30 + 28 is 58, plus 11 is 69. So 69 days after January 1st. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then day 1 is January 2nd. So the number of days between January 1st and March 11th is 69 days. Wait, but maybe I should count the days from January 1st to March 11th inclusive? No, the problem is asking for the day of the week of March 11th, so if January 1st is a Wednesday, then adding 69 days to that date will give me the day of the week.\n\nBut wait, how do I calculate the day of the week? Since each week has 7 days, I can take the total number of days modulo 7. So 69 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7*9=63, 69-63=6. So 69 days is 9 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Wednesday. Let's count: Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday, +5 is Monday, +6 is Tuesday. So March 11th would be a Tuesday? Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, January 1st is day 0 (Wednesday). Then January 1st + 1 day is January 2nd (Thursday). So the number of days between January 1st and March 11th is 69 days. So 69 days later. So 69 mod 7 is 6. So adding 6 days to Wednesday. So Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check the actual dates. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Wednesday. Then January 8th is also Wednesday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Wednesday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is Wednesday. Then March 12th is Wednesday. So March 11th is two days before March 12th, which is Wednesday. So March 11th would be Tuesday. So that matches the previous calculation. So the answer is Tuesday. Wait, but wait, maybe I should check again. Let me count the days from January 1st to March 11th.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the Sundays would be on the 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 24th. Wait, let me count again.

Wait, I can't actually browse the internet, but I can recall that December 2022 had Sundays on the 4th, 11th, 18th, and 25th. So the fourth Sunday would be the 25th.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yeah, that makes sense. So 2022 started on a Sunday.\n\nNow, October 1st is the 274th day of the year. Wait, how do I calculate that? Let me count the days. January has 31 days, February 28 (since 2022 isn't a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30.

So if I can figure out what day of the week that is, given that January 1 was a Sunday.\n\nSince each week has 7 days, 274 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder will tell me how many days ahead. Let's do the division: 274 divided by 7. 7*39 is 273, so 274 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So January 1 is Sunday, adding 39 weeks (which is 0 days) and 1 day. So October 1st would be Sunday + 1 day = Monday?\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, if January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is also Sunday, and so on. So each subsequent day adds one. So if 274 days later is October 1, then 274 days after January 1, 2022. Since 274 divided by 7 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Sunday would be Monday. So October 1st, 2022 is a Monday?\n\nBut I should check this again. Maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me verify the number of days in each month again. January 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30. Adding those up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n+31 (Mar) = 90\n+30 (Apr) = 120\n+31 (May) = 151\n+30 (Jun) = 181\n+31 (Jul) = 212\n+31 (Aug) = 243\n+30 (Sep) = 273. So October 1 is day 274. Correct.\n\nSo 274 days from January 1. 274 divided by 7 is 39*7=273, remainder 1. So 39 weeks and 1 day. So January 1 is Sunday, adding 1 day would be Monday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is a Monday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. For example, I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday? Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing with another year. Wait, I think I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but according to my calculation, it's Monday. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me check another approach. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. July 4 is the 195th day of the year (since 31+28+31+30+31+30+4= 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +4=185? Wait, no. Wait, July 4 is the 195th day? Let me recount:\n\nJanuary 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 4. So 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, then July 4 is 181 + 4 = 185. So July 4 is day 185. If July 4 is a Monday, then 185 days from January 1. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks (182 days) and 3 days. So January 1 is Sunday, adding 3 days would be Wednesday. But that contradicts my previous statement that January 1 was a Sunday. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I got the day of the week for July 4 wrong.\n\nWait, I think I need to check an actual calendar. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check online... Wait, but since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that again. If I remember correctly, 2021 started on a Saturday, so 2022 started on a Sunday. That's correct. So January 1, 2022 is Sunday.\n\nNow, July 4, 2022. Let's count the days from January 1 to July 4. January has 31 days, so 31 days in January. February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 4. So total days: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 4 = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +4=185. So July 4 is day 185. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks (182 days) and 3 days. So January 1 is Sunday, adding 3 days would be Wednesday. So July 4, 2022 is a Wednesday? But I thought it was a Monday. Hmm, maybe I was wrong. Let me check another date. For example, July 1, 2022. If July 4 is Wednesday, then July 1 would be Sunday. Wait, July 1 is Sunday, July 2 is Monday, July 3 is Tuesday, July 4 is Wednesday. That makes sense. So July 1 is Sunday. Then, July 1 is Sunday. So July 1, 2022 is Sunday. Then, August 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So August 1 is Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. So August 1 is Wednesday. Then, September 1 is 31 days after August 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So September 1 is Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday. Then October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So October 1 is Saturday + 2 days = Monday. So that matches my initial calculation. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is a Monday. So the answer should be Monday.", "Monday"], [49, "Count forward 80 days from Wednesday, July 6, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 80 days after Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Hmm, first, I should figure out the date 80 days later. Then, determine the weekday.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than counting each day. Since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can divide 80 by 7 and find the remainder. That remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is.\n\nSo 80 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 11 is 77, so 80 minus 77 is 3. So the remainder is 3. That means 80 days later is 3 days after Wednesday. \n\nWednesday plus 1 day is Thursday, plus 2 is Friday, plus 3 is Saturday. So the answer should be Saturday? Wait, but I need to make sure that the date calculation is correct. Because sometimes when you cross months or leap years, the number of days might change. But since 2022 is not a leap year, right? So July has 31 days. Let me check the actual dates to confirm.\n\nStarting from July 6, 2022. Adding 80 days. Let's break it down. July has 31 days, so from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days (31-6=25). Then August has 31 days, September has 30, October 31, etc. Wait, but adding 80 days: 25 days in July, then 31 in August (total 56), then 24 days in September (56+24=80). So the date would be September 24, 2022. Wait, but let me check that again. July 6 plus 25 days is July 31. Then adding 31 days (August) would take us to September 30. Wait, no, 25 + 31 is 56. Then 80 - 56 is 24 days into September. So September 24, 2022. \n\nNow, I need to check what day of the week that is. But maybe I can use the initial calculation. If 80 days later is 3 days after Wednesday, then it should be Saturday. But maybe I should verify with an actual calendar or a date calculator. Alternatively, I can check the weekday of July 6, 2022, which is given as Wednesday. Let me confirm that. \n\nLooking up a calendar, July 6, 2022 was indeed a Wednesday. Then adding 80 days. Let me count the days step by step. Let's see:\n\nJuly 6 (Wednesday) + 7 days is July 13 (Wednesday). Then adding 7 days again is July 20 (Wednesday), July 27 (Wednesday), August 3 (Wednesday), August 10 (Wednesday), August 17 (Wednesday), August 24 (Wednesday), August 31 (Wednesday). Then September 7 (Wednesday). So each week adds 7 days. Now, 80 days is 11 weeks (77 days) plus 3 days. So 77 days later is September 7, 2022 (Wednesday). Then adding 3 days: September 7 (Wednesday), 8 (Thursday), 9 (Friday), 10 (Saturday). Wait, but that would be 3 days after Wednesday, which is Saturday. But earlier I thought the date was September 24. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the date calculation.\n\nWait, if July 6 is day 0, then adding 7 days is July 13 (day 7), then day 14 is July 20, day 21 July 27, day 28 August 3, day 35 August 10, day 42 August 17, day 49 August 24, day 56 August 31, day 63 September 7, day 70 September 14, day 77 September 21, day 84 September 28. Wait, so day 77 is September 21, 2022. Then adding 3 days would be September 24, 2022. But according to the previous count, September 7 is day 63. Then day 63 + 7 days is day 70 (Sep 14), day 77 (Sep 21), day 84 (Sep 28). So 80 days after July 6 is day 80, which is 3 days after day 77 (Sep 21). So Sep 21 + 3 days is Sep 24. So that's correct. So September 24, 2022. Now, if September 21 is a Wednesday, then September 24 is Saturday. So that matches the earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, maybe I can check an online calendar or use another method. Alternatively, I can use the fact that July 6, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let me check the actual date. For example, if I look up September 24, 2022, what day was that? Well, I can check that. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my calculations. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let me count the days again. From July 6 to July 31 is 25 days. Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to September 30. Wait, but 25 + 31 = 56 days. Then 80 - 56 = 24 days into September. So September 24. So that's correct. \n\nNow, if I can figure out the weekday of September 24, 2022. Since July 6 is Wednesday, and adding 80 days. Since 80 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 3 days, so adding 3 days to Wednesday is Saturday.

I need to figure out which day that is. \n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Thursday would be May 4th, because May 1 is Sunday, so adding three days gets to Thursday. Then the second Thursday would be May 11th.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the days. Let me think again. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday. Oh, right! So the first Thursday is May 5th. Then the second Thursday would be May 12th. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I should check an actual calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think again. If May 1 is Sunday, then the first Thursday is May 5 (since 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, 3 Tuesday, 4 Wednesday, 5 Thursday). Then the next Thursday would be 5 + 7 = 12th. So the second Thursday is May 12th. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me count again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. Wait, I think I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. For example, May 2, 2022, was a Monday. So yes, that's correct. So the first Thursday is May 5th. Then the second one is May 12th. Therefore, the answer should be 12. But wait, maybe I should check if there's a mistake here. Let me think again.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use a known date that I'm certain about. For example, I remember that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Wait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of Zeller's Congruence or some other algorithm. But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days and count forward or backward from a known date.\n\nLet me try to find a known date in 2022. For example, I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I can confirm that, then I can count the days from June 1 to June 15.\n\nWait, if June 1 is a Wednesday, then June 8 would be the next Wednesday, and June 15 would be another Wednesday. So that would make June 15 a Wednesday. But I need to make sure that June 1, 2022 was indeed a Wednesday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If July 1 is a Friday, then June 30 would be a Thursday. Then June 30 is Thursday, so June 29 is Wednesday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 27 is Monday, June 26 is Sunday, June 25 is Saturday, June 24 is Friday, June 23 is Thursday, June 22 is Wednesday, June 21 is Tuesday, June 20 is Monday, June 19 is Sunday, June 18 is Saturday, June 17 is Friday, June 16 is Thursday, June 15 is Wednesday.

April 30 is a Sunday. Then May 7, 14, 21, 28 would be Sundays. June 4, 11, 18, 25 would be Sundays. So June 4 is a Sunday.

Then June 15 would be Thursday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. So there's a problem here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that. I think that January 1, 2022 was actually a Sunday. Let me confirm. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 2022 is a leap year? No, 2022 is not a leap year. So 2022 has 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Monday. But I think that's correct. However, I need to check if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a known date. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think again. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 would be a Friday. Because July 1 is three days before July 4. So July 1, 2022 was a Friday. That would mean that June 30, 2022 was a Thursday. Then, going back, June 23 was a Thursday, June 22 was Wednesday, June 21 was Tuesday, June 20 was Monday, June 19 was Sunday, June 18 was Saturday, June 17 was Friday, June 16 was Thursday, June 15 was Wednesday. So that would make June 15, 2022 a Wednesday. But earlier when I tried to count from January 1, 2022 as Sunday, I got conflicting results.

So July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. That's correct. So that would mean that June 30 is Thursday. Then, June 23 is Thursday. Then June 15 is Wednesday. So that would be correct. Therefore, June 15, 2022 was a Wednesday.\n\nBut earlier when I tried to count from January 1, 2022 as Sunday, I thought that June 4 was a Sunday, but that might be incorrect. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday, 15 is Sunday, 22 is Sunday, 29 is Sunday. Then February 5 is Sunday, 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30.

Then June 15 would be Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. So which is correct?\n\nThis is confusing. There's a contradiction here. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that again. If July 1, 2022 is a Friday, then January 1, 2022 would be... Let's calculate the number of days between January 1, 2022 and July 1, 2022. January has 31 days, February 28 (not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30. So from January 1 to July 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181 days. So 181 days between January 1 and July 1. 181 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 6 days. So if July 1 is a Friday, then January 1 would be 6 days before Friday. So Friday minus 6 days is Saturday (Friday -1 is Thursday, -2 Wednesday, -3 Tuesday, -4 Monday, -5 Sunday, -6 Saturday). So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. But that contradicts my previous assumption that it was a Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if July 1 is a Friday, then January 1 is a Saturday. Then, let's check the days again. If January 1 is a Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, 15 is Saturday, 22 is Saturday, 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday, 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7, 14, 21, 28. June 4, 11, 18, 25. So June 4 is Saturday. Then June 5 is Sunday, 6 Monday, 7 Tuesday, 8 Wednesday, 9 Thursday, 10 Friday, 11 Saturday, 12 Sunday, 13 Monday, 14 Tuesday, 15 Wednesday. So June 15 would be Wednesday. That matches the previous conclusion. So that's correct. Therefore, the mistake was in assuming that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. It's actually a Saturday. So that explains the discrepancy.\n\nTherefore, June 15, 2022 was a Wednesday. So the answer should be Wednesday.", "Wednesday"]]}
