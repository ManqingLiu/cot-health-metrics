Give the count numerically. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the first Wednesday of May 2022. Let me start by recalling what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use some known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then, counting the days for May... Wait, maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use an online calendar or a day calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to remember or calculate it manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May has 31 days. Let me think. If May 1 is a Sunday, then the first Wednesday would be the 3rd. Because Sunday (1st), Monday (2nd), Tuesday (3rd), Wednesday (4th)? Wait, no. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday would be the 4th. Wait, but that would mean the first Wednesday is the 4th. But wait, maybe I got the day wrong. Let me check again. Let me think of another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I remember that May 6, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if May 6 is Friday, then May 5 is Thursday, May 4 is Wednesday. So that would mean that the first Wednesday is May 4. So that's consistent with the previous thought. So if May 1 is Sunday, then May 4 is Wednesday. Therefore, the first Wednesday of May 2022 is the 4th. Therefore, the answer should be 4. But wait, maybe I need to confirm again. Let me think of another way. Let's check the days for May 2022. Let me try to count the days. Let's say May 1 is Sunday. Then:\n\nMay 1: Sunday\n\nMay 2: Monday\n\nMay 3: Tuesday\n\nMay 4: Wednesday\n\nSo yes, the first Wednesday is the 4th. Therefore, the answer is 4. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check another way. For example, if I know that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday, then that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can check the actual calendar. Wait, I think I remember that in 2022, May 1 was a Sunday. Let me think of another way. For example, April 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then April has 30 days. So April 1 is Friday, April 8 is Friday, April 15, 22, 29. Then May 1 is the next day, which would be Saturday? Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 30 is a Friday as well, since April has 30 days. Wait, April 1 is Friday, then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday, April 4 is Monday, and so on. Then April 30 would be a Friday? Wait, 30 days later. Let me calculate. April has 30 days. So April 1 is Friday. Then April 1 + 7 days is April 8 (Friday). Then April 15 (Friday), 22 (Friday), 29 (Friday). Then April 30 is the next day, which is Saturday. Therefore, May 1, 2022, would be a Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nWait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 30 is Saturday. Therefore, May 1 is Sunday. Wait, that's correct. Because April 30 is Saturday, so May 1 is Sunday. So that would mean that May 1 is Sunday. Then May 4 is Wednesday. So that's correct. But earlier, I thought that April 1 was Friday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that April 1, 2022, was a Friday. Let me check. For example, I know that April 1, 2021, was a Friday. Then 2022 is a leap year? No, 2022 is not a leap year. So 2022 has 365 days. So 2021 had 365 days. So April 1, 2022, would be 365 days after April 1, 2021. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So April 1, 2022, would be one day later than April 1, 2021. Since April 1, 2021, was a Friday, then April 1, 2022, would be a Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me check the actual calendar for May 2022. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can use my knowledge. Let me think. For example, I know that May 2022 started on a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then the first Wednesday is the 4th. But if May 1 is Sunday, then May 4 is Wednesday. However, if May 1 is Saturday, then the first Wednesday would be the 3rd. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for a known date in May 2022. For example, I know that May 6, 2022, was a Friday. Let me check that. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 6 is Friday. Because May 1 (Sunday), 2 (Mon), 3 (Tue), 4 (Wed), 5 (Thu), 6 (Fri). Yes, that's correct. So May 6 is Friday. Therefore, that would mean that May 1 is Sunday. Therefore, the first Wednesday is the 4th. Therefore, the answer is 4. So the answer should be 4. Therefore, the first Wednesday of May 2022 is the 4th. So the answer is 4.\n</think>", "4"], [124, "Between Tuesday, November 8, 2022 and Friday, December 16, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Answer with a number.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, November 8, 2022, and Friday, December 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week's days in that period.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. November 8, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to remember or calculate. Let me think. November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday? Let me check. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me count. If November 1 is Tuesday, then November 8 would be the next Tuesday. So yes, November 8 is a Tuesday. Then the period starts on Tuesday, November 8, and ends on Friday, December 16. So I need to count all the days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive, then subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe break it down into weeks. Let's see. Let's first find the total number of days between the two dates. Let's calculate the number of days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive.\n\nFirst, November has 30 days. So from November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 = 22 days, but since we include both start and end dates, it's 22 + 1 = 23 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have from day 1 to day 30, that's 30 days. So from November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 = 22 days, but adding 1 because both ends are included. So 22 + 1 = 23 days. Then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. So total days would be 23 + 16 = 39 days. Wait, but wait, November 8 to November 30 is 23 days? Let me check. Let's take November 8 as day 1. Then November 9 is day 2, ..., November 30 is day 23. Yes, because 30 - 8 = 22 days between them, plus 1 for the start date. So 23 days in November. Then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. So total days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive is 23 + 16 = 39 days. So total days is 39.\n\nNow, out of these 39 days, how many are weekends? Let's find the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nFirst, let's note that November 8 is a Tuesday. So the first day is Tuesday. Let's list the days of the week for each week in this period.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tuesday):\n\nWeek 1: Nov 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun). So that's 6 days. So in this week, the weekend days are 12 (Sat) and 13 (Sun). So 2 days.\n\nThen the next week, November 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun). So that's another 7 days. Weekends here are 19 (Sat) and 20 (Sun). So 2 days.\n\nThen November 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Weekends again 26 and 27. 2 days.\n\nThen November 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed). Wait, November 30 is a Wednesday. Then December 1 is Thursday. So the next week starts on Dec 1 (Thu), Dec 2 (Fri), Dec 3 (Sat), Dec 4 (Sun), Dec 5 (Mon), Dec 6 (Tue), Dec 7 (Wed), Dec 8 (Thu), Dec 9 (Fri), Dec 10 (Sat), Dec 11 (Sun), Dec 12 (Mon), Dec 13 (Tue), Dec 14 (Wed), Dec 15 (Thu), Dec 16 (Fri). Wait, but the end date is Dec 16, which is a Friday.\n\nSo let's break down the weeks:\n\nFirst, November 8-14: 7 days. Weekends are 12 (Sat) and 13 (Sun). So 2 days.\n\nThen November 15-21: 7 days. Weekends 19 (Sat) and 20 (Sun). Wait, November 15 is a Tuesday. Wait, November 14 is a Sunday. Wait, maybe I need to check again. Wait, November 8 is Tuesday. Then November 14 is the next Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, November 8 is Tuesday. Then November 9 is Wednesday, 10 Thu, 11 Fri, 12 Sat, 13 Sun, 14 Mon. Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, November 8 is Tuesday. Then November 9 is Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday, 13 Sunday, 14 Monday. So the first week (Nov 8-14) includes 7 days. So the weekend days are 12 (Sat) and 13 (Sun). Then the next week is Nov 14 (Mon) to Nov 20 (Sun). So that's 7 days. Weekends are 19 (Sat) and 20 (Sun). Then the next week is Nov 21 (Mon) to Nov 27 (Sun). Weekends 26 (Sat) and 27 (Sun). Then November 28 (Mon) to Dec 4 (Sun). Weekends 28 (Mon) to Dec 4 (Sun). Wait, no. Wait, November 28 is Monday. Then Dec 1 is Thursday. Wait, November 28 is Monday. Then November 29 is Tuesday, 30 Wednesday. Then December 1 is Thursday. So the next week would be Dec 1 (Thu) to Dec 7 (Wed). Wait, but Dec 7 is a Wednesday. Then Dec 8 is Thursday. So the next week is Dec 8-14, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I need to list all the dates and their days of the week. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tuesday):\n\nWeek 1: Nov 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon). So that's 7 days. Weekends: 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 2: Nov 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun). Weekends: 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 3: Nov 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Weekends: 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 4: Nov 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), Dec 1 (Thu), Dec 2 (Fri), Dec 3 (Sat), Dec 4 (Sun). Weekends: 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 5: Dec 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun). Weekends: 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 6: Dec 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri). So this week is only 5 days. The end date is Dec 16 (Friday). So in this week, there are no weekends because the weekend days are 10 (Sat) and 11 (Sun), which are in the previous week. So in this week, Dec 12-16, all days are business days. So no weekends here.\n\nSo total weeks:\n\nWeek 1: 2 weekends\n\nWeek 2: 2\n\nWeek 3: 2\n\nWeek 4: 2\n\nWeek 5: 2\n\nWeek 6: 0\n\nTotal weekends: 2+2+2+2+2 = 10 days.\n\nWait, but wait, the total days from Nov 8 to Dec 16 is 39 days. So 39 total days minus 10 weekends would be 29 business days. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weeks. Let me check the number of days again. Let's count the number of weeks and days.\n\nFrom Nov 8 to Dec 16 inclusive:\n\nNovember has 30 days. So from Nov 8 to Nov 30 is 23 days (as calculated before). Then Dec 1 to Dec 16 is 16 days. Total 23 + 16 = 39 days. So 39 days total.\n\nIf there are 10 weekend days, then 39 - 10 = 29 business days. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of weekends in each week.\n\nLet me list all the weekends in the period:\n\nWeek 1: Nov 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun)\n\nWeek 2: Nov 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun)\n\nWeek 3: Nov 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun)\n\nWeek 4: Dec 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun)\n\nWeek 5: Dec 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun)\n\nThat's 2 days per week for 5 weeks, so 10 days. So that's correct. So 10 weekend days. So 39 total days minus 10 weekends is 29 business days. So the answer should be 29?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the number of weekends in each week again.\n\nWait, the first week (Nov 8-14) has 12 (Sat) and 13 (Sun). Then the next week (Nov 14-20) has 19 (Sat) and 20 (Sun). Then Nov 21-27: 26 (Sat) and 27 (Sun). Then Nov 28- Dec 4: 3 (Sat) and 4 (Sun). Then Dec 5-11: 10 (Sat) and 11 (Sun). Then Dec 12-16 is the next week, but that's only 5 days, no weekends. So that's 5 weekends (each with 2 days) \u2192 5*2=10. So yes, 10 weekends. So 39-10=29 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, etc. from Nov 8 to Dec 16.\n\nStarting from Nov 8 (Tuesday). Let's count each day:\n\nWeek 1: Nov 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon). So in this week, the business days are Tue to Fri (4 days) and Mon (1 day). Wait, but the week starts on Tuesday. Wait, the first week is from Nov 8 (Tue) to Nov 14 (Mon). So the business days in this week are Tue (8), Wed (9), Thu (10), Fri (11), Mon (14). So that's 5 business days. Wait, but the weekend days are Sat (12) and Sun (13). So 5 business days in this week.\n\nThen the next week (Nov 14 (Mon) to Nov 20 (Sun)). Business days are Mon (14), Tue (15), Wed (16), Thu (17), Fri (18). Then Sat (19) and Sun (20) are weekends. So 5 business days here.\n\nThird week (Nov 21 (Mon) to Nov 27 (Sun)): same as before, 5 business days (Mon to Fri).\n\nFourth week (Nov 28 (Mon) to Dec 4 (Sun)): business days are Mon (28), Tue (29), Wed (30), Thu (Dec 1), Fri (Dec 2). Then Sat (3) and Sun (4) are weekends. So 5 business days here.\n\nFifth week (Dec 5 (Mon) to Dec 11 (Sun)): business days are Mon (5), Tue (6), Wed (7), Thu (8), Fri (9). Then Sat (10) and Sun (11) are weekends. So 5 business days here.\n\nThen the sixth week (Dec 12 (Mon) to Dec 16 (Fri)): business days are Mon (12), Tue (13), Wed (14), Thu (15), Fri (16). So 5 business days here.\n\nSo total business days: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 30? Wait, that's 30. But earlier calculation said 29. There's a discrepancy here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, the total days are 39. If there are 5 business days per week for 6 weeks, that's 30. But 30 business days would mean 39 - 30 = 9 weekend days. But earlier I counted 10. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of weeks. Let me check the actual dates again.\n\nFirst week: Nov 8-14 (7 days) \u2192 5 business days.\n\nSecond week: Nov 14-20 (7 days) \u2192 5 business days.\n\nThird week: Nov 21-27 (7 days) \u2192 5 business days.\n\nFourth week: Nov 28- Dec 4 (7 days) \u2192 5 business days.\n\nFifth week: Dec 5-11 (7 days) \u2192 5 business days.\n\nSixth week: Dec 12-16 (5 days) \u2192 5 business days.\n\nWait, but that's 6 weeks. But the total days would be 7*5 + 5 = 40 days. But earlier calculation said 39 days. So there's a problem here. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, the total days from Nov 8 to Dec 16 inclusive is 39 days. But according to the weeks, if each of the first five weeks is 7 days, that's 35 days, plus the sixth week of 5 days is 40. That's conflicting. So there's an error here.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the total days. Let's count the days from Nov 8 to Dec 16 inclusive.\n\nNovember has 30 days. So from Nov 8 to Nov 30 is 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Then December 1 to Dec 16 is 16 days. So total is 23 + 16 = 39 days. Correct.\n\nBut according to the weeks, if the first five weeks are 7 days each (35 days) and the sixth week is 5 days, that's 40 days. So that's a problem. Therefore, my breakdown of the weeks is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the sixth week is not 5 days. Let me check the dates again.\n\nFirst week: Nov 8 (Tue) to Nov 14 (Mon) \u2192 7 days.\n\nSecond week: Nov 14 (Mon) to Nov 20 (Sun) \u2192 7 days.\n\nThird week: Nov 21 (Mon) to Nov 27 (Sun) \u2192 7 days.\n\nFourth week: Nov 28 (Mon) to Dec 4 (Sun) \u2192 7 days.\n\nFifth week: Dec 5 (Mon) to Dec 11 (Sun) \u2192 7 days.\n\nSixth week: Dec 12 (Mon) to Dec 16 (Fri) \u2192 5 days.\n\nSo that's 7*5 + 5 = 40 days. But that's not possible because the total is 39 days. Therefore, there's an error in the way I'm counting the weeks. Let me check the actual dates.\n\nWait, Dec 11 is a Sunday. Then Dec 12 is a Monday. So from Dec 12 to Dec 16 is 5 days (Mon-Fri). So that's correct. But then the total days would be 7*5 (35) + 5 = 40. But according to the previous calculation, it's 39. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, the first week is Nov 8 to Nov 14 (7 days). Then the second week is Nov 14 to Nov 20 (7 days). But Nov 14 is included in both weeks. So that's overlapping. Therefore, the total"], [124, "Tell me whether 1940 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1940 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1940 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1940 divided by 4. 4 times 485 is 1940, right? Because 4 times 500 is 2000, subtract 4 times 15 which is 60, so 2000 - 60 = 1940. So 485 times 4 is 1940. That means 1940 is divisible by 4. So that's the first condition satisfied.\n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. So 1940 divided by 100 is 19.4. Wait, that's not an integer. So 1940 is not a century year. Therefore, the second condition (divisible by 400) doesn't apply here. Since it's not a century year, and it's divisible by 4, then according to the rules, it should be a leap year.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me calculate 1940 divided by 100 again. 100 times 19 is 1900, and 1940 minus 1900 is 40. So 1940 is 19.4 times 100, which is not a whole number. So yes, it's not a century year. Therefore, the only condition that matters is being divisible by 4. So 1940 is a leap year. \n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be Yes.\n</think>", "Yes"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the second Tuesday in November 2022. Give the count numerically. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the day of the month for the second Tuesday in November 2022. Let me start by recalling what day November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then August 1 was a Monday, September 1 was a Thursday, October 1 was a Saturday, and November 1 would be a Tuesday. Wait, that seems right. Let me count the days between July 1 and November 1. July has 31 days, so July 1 to July 31 is 30 days later. August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. September has 30, and October has 31. Wait, but from July 1 to November 1 is 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) - 1 (since we're including July 1 and not November 1)? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days between July 1 and November 1 is 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) - 1? No, actually, if you go from July 1 to August 1, that's 31 days. Then August 1 to September 1 is another 31 days. September 1 to October 1 is 30 days. October 1 to November 1 is 31 days. So total days from July 1 to November 1 is 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 123 days. Wait, but July 1 is day 0, so adding 123 days would be November 1. Wait, but if July 1 is a Friday, then adding 123 days. Let me check the day of the week. 123 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 4 days. So Friday plus 4 days is Tuesday. So yes, November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. That seems correct.\n\nSo if November 1 is a Tuesday, then the first Tuesday is the 1st. The second Tuesday would be the 8th. Wait, because the first is 1, then adding 7 days is 8. So the second Tuesday is the 8th. But wait, let me make sure. Let me list the Tuesdays in November 2022. If November 1 is Tuesday, then the Tuesdays would be 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. So the second one is the 8th. Therefore, the answer should be 8. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another way. Let me check an actual calendar for November 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use another method. For example, if I know that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if November 1 is Tuesday, then November 2 is Wednesday, 3 is Thursday, 4 is Friday. So that's correct. Then November 5 is Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, 8 Tuesday. So yes, the second Tuesday is the 8th. Therefore, the answer is 8. But wait, the question says \"the second Tuesday\". So first is 1, second is 8. So the answer is 8. But maybe I should check if there's any possibility that November 1 is not a Tuesday. Wait, I thought that July 1 was a Friday. Let me check that again. July 1, 2022: I think that's correct. Let me count the days from July 1 to November 1. July has 31 days, so July 1 to July 31 is 30 days later. August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. September has 30, October 31. So total days from July 1 to November 1 is 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on July 1, then July 1 to August 1 is 31 days. Then August 1 to September 1 is 31 days. September 1 to October 1 is 30 days. October 1 to November 1 is 31 days. So total is 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 123 days. So 123 days after July 1 is November 1. Since July 1 is a Friday, adding 123 days. 123 divided by 7 is 17 weeks (119 days) and 4 days. So Friday + 4 days is Tuesday. So November 1 is Tuesday. Therefore, the second Tuesday is the 8th.

Alright, so first, I need to remember that each week has 7 days. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 7 days would bring me back to the same day. So January 8th would also be a Saturday. Then January 9th would be Sunday, and January 10th would be Monday. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me check again. Let's count each day step by step. January 1 is Saturday. Then:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\n\nJanuary 2: Sunday\n\nJanuary 3: Monday\n\nJanuary 4: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 5: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 6: Thursday\n\nJanuary 7: Friday\n\nJanuary 8: Saturday (that's 7 days later, so same day)\n\nJanuary 9: Sunday\n\nJanuary 10: Monday\n\nYes, that seems correct. So January 10th would be a Monday. Wait, but maybe I should consider if there's any leap year or something? But the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. It just says January 1 is a Saturday. So I think it's safe to assume that the days are just moving normally. So the answer should be Monday. Let me just confirm once more. From 1st to 10th is 9 days later. Wait, 10 minus 1 is 9 days. Wait, but if 1 is Saturday, then adding 1 day is Sunday (day 2), so adding 9 days would be day 10. Let me count 9 days from Saturday. Let's see:\n\nDay 0: Saturday (Jan 1)\n\nDay 1: Sunday (Jan 2)\n\nDay 2: Monday (Jan 3)\n\nDay 3: Tuesday (Jan 4)\n\nDay 4: Wednesday (Jan 5)\n\nDay 5: Thursday (Jan 6)\n\nDay 6: Friday (Jan 7)\n\nDay 7: Saturday (Jan 8)\n\nDay 8: Sunday (Jan 9)\n\nDay 9: Monday (Jan 10)\n\nYes, that's correct. So 9 days later is Monday. Therefore, the answer is Monday.\n</think>", "Monday"], [124, "Count forward 51 days from Friday, November 11, 2022 - what's the weekday? Answer with the weekday's name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it will be 51 days after Friday, November 11, 2022. Hmm, so first, I should probably figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 51 days because weeks cycle every 7 days. \n\nSo, 51 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 7 is 49, so that's 7 weeks, which is 49 days. That leaves 2 days remaining. So 51 days is 7 weeks and 2 days. Since the weeks don't affect the day of the week, adding 7 weeks to Friday would still be Friday. Then, adding the remaining 2 days would take it to the next days. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. If I start on Friday, November 11, 2022, then adding 7 days would be November 18, which is also a Friday. Then adding another 7 days would be November 25, Friday again. Then December 2nd, Friday. Then December 9th, Friday. Then December 16th, Friday. Then December 23rd, Friday. Then December 30th, Friday. Wait, but that's 7 weeks, which is 49 days. So adding 49 days would still be Friday. Then adding 2 more days would be Saturday (day 50) and Sunday (day 51). So the 51st day would be Sunday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the dates? Wait, November 11, 2022 is a Friday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're starting in November, maybe that's not an issue here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's try that. Starting from November 11, 2022 (Friday). Let's count 51 days forward. \n\nFirst, November has 30 days. So from November 11 to November 30 is 30 - 11 = 19 days. Wait, but if I start on the 11th, then adding 1 day would be the 12th. So from the 11th to the 30th is 19 days. Wait, 30 - 11 = 19, but that's the number of days after the 11th. So if I add 19 days to November 11, that would be November 30. Then, November 30 is 19 days later. Then, December has 31 days. So adding 31 days would take me to December 31. But wait, I need to add 51 days total. So 19 days in November, then 31 days in December would be 50 days. Then 51 days would be 1 day into January 2023. \n\nWait, but that's a different approach. Let me check. So November 11 + 19 days is November 30. Then adding 31 days would be December 31 (since 19 + 31 = 50 days). Then adding one more day would be January 1, 2023. So that's 51 days. \n\nNow, what day of the week is January 1, 2023? Let's see. If November 11 is a Friday, then November 30 is 19 days later. 19 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Friday would be Wednesday (Friday + 1 is Saturday, +2 Sunday, +3 Monday, +4 Tuesday, +5 Wednesday). So November 30 is a Wednesday. Then December 31 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Wednesday would be Saturday (Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 Friday, +3 Saturday). So December 31 is a Saturday. Then January 1 is the next day, which is Sunday. \n\nSo that would mean that 51 days after November 11 is Sunday. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought of 51 days as 7 weeks and 2 days, adding 2 days to Friday would be Sunday. So both methods agree. So the answer should be Sunday. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. 51 divided by 7 is 7*7=49, remainder 2. So 51 days is 7 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Friday is Saturday (1) and Sunday (2). So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. Let me check the actual date. Wait, November 11, 2022 is a Friday. Let me check an online calendar or use another way. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my calculations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 51 days to November 11 would be January 1, 2023. So that would be Sunday. So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Sunday.\n</think>", "Sunday"], [124, "In a year where Sunday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 14. State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find out what day of the week March 14th is, given that January 1st is a Sunday. Hmm, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 14th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, let me break down the months. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, but since the question is about a specific year where January 1st is a Sunday, maybe I need to assume it's not a leap year unless specified. Wait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year? Or maybe it's a leap year? Wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years, so maybe I should assume it's a common year. Let me check that. If it's a common year, February has 28 days. If it's a leap year, 29. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check if there's a way to determine that. Wait, but maybe the answer is the same regardless? No, that's not possible. Wait, but maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Let me think. Since the problem is given as a general question, perhaps it's safe to assume a non-leap year. But maybe I should check both possibilities? Wait, but the problem says \"in a year where Sunday is January 1st\". So maybe the year is not a leap year. Wait, but how can I know? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? No, that's not possible. Wait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption first.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to March 14th is January 1st to January 31st (30 days), then February (28 days), then March 1st to March 14th (14 days). Wait, no. Wait, March 14th is 14 days after March 1st. Wait, but the total days from January 1st to March 14th is 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 14 (March) minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and March 14th is (31 - 1) days in January (since January 1st is day 0), plus 28 days in February, plus 14 days in March. Wait, no. Wait, if I want to count the number of days from January 1st to March 14th inclusive, that's 31 + 28 + 14 days? Wait, no. Wait, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that to get to March 1st. Then March 1st to March 14th is 14 days. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 31 + 28 + 14 = 73 days. But wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is day 0, January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31, and so on. So the total number of days from January 1st to March 14th is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 14 (days in March) minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, if you count from January 1st (inclusive) to March 14th (inclusive), then it's 31 + 28 + 14 days. But that would be 73 days. However, if you want to find the number of days between January 1st and March 14th, not including January 1st, then it's 72 days. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, if January 1st is Sunday, then adding 72 days would be the same as adding 72 mod 7 days. Because each week has 7 days. So 72 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 2 days. So 72 days later would be 2 days after Sunday. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is Sunday, then January 1st + 1 day is Monday (day 1), and so on. So if I have 72 days after January 1st, that would be 72 days later. So 72 divided by 7 is 10*7=70, remainder 2. So 72 days later is 2 days after Sunday, which is Tuesday. Therefore, March 14th would be a Tuesday? Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's count the days step by step. January 1st is day 0 (Sunday). Then January 8th is day 7 (Sunday again). Then January 15th is day 14 (Sunday). So every 7 days, it's the same day. So January 1st is Sunday. Then, January 1st + 31 days is February 1st. Wait, but 31 days later. Wait, 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1st would be Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is 28 days after February 1st. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28th is also Wednesday. Then March 1st is the next day, which is Thursday. Then March 14th is 14 days after March 1st. 14 days is 2 weeks, so March 14th would be Thursday again. Wait, that would mean March 14th is Thursday. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again. First approach: total days from January 1st to March 14th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 14 (Mar) = 73 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then March 14th is day 72 (since day 0 is Jan 1, day 1 is Jan 2, ..., day 72 is March 14). Wait, no. Wait, if January has 31 days, then the number of days from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. So if you add 28 days for February, that's 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 14th is 14 days after March 1st, so 59 + 14 = 73 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then March 14th is day 72? Wait, no. Because if you have 31 days in January, then the 31st is day 30 (since day 0 is Jan 1). Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. If January 1st is day 0 (Sunday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Monday), ..., January 8th is day 7 (Sunday). So January 1st is day 0, January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31. Then February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58 (since February 1st is day 31, adding 27 days gets to February 28th). Then March 1st is day 59. Then March 14th is day 59 + 13 = day 72. So March 14th is day 72. Now, 72 divided by 7 is 10 weeks (70 days) and 2 days. So 72 days later is 2 days after Sunday. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. But according to the other approach, when I calculated that February 1st is Wednesday, then March 1st is Thursday, and March 14th is 14 days later, which is Thursday again. So that would be Thursday. Which is conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe the mistake is in the first approach. Let me check the second approach again. If January 1st is Sunday (day 0). Then January 1st + 31 days is February 1st. 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So February 1st is Wednesday. Then February has 28 days. 28 days later is 4 weeks, so February 28th is also Wednesday. Then March 1st is Thursday. Then March 14th is 14 days later. 14 days is exactly 2 weeks, so March 14th is Thursday. So that would be Thursday. But according to the first approach, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the first approach is wrong. Let me check the total days again. If March 14th is day 72, then 72 days after January 1st. But if January 1st is day 0, then day 72 is 72 days after. But if I count the days from January 1st to March 14th, how many days is that? Let's count the days in each month. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days gets to March 1st. Then March 1st to March 14th is 14 days. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 31 + 28 + 14 = 73 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then March 14th is day 72. Wait, that's a contradiction. Because if you have 31 days in January, then the 31st is day 30 (since day 0 is Jan 1). Then adding 28 days for February, that's day 30 + 28 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59. Then March 14th is day 59 + 13 = day 72. So that's 72 days. But according to the other way, adding 31 + 28 + 14 = 73 days. So why is there a discrepancy? Because when you add the days, you are counting the number of days from January 1st to March 14th inclusive. But if you count the days from January 1st (day 0) to March 14th (day 72), that's 73 days in total. Wait, no. Because day 0 is January 1st, day 1 is January 2nd, ..., day 72 is March 14th. So the total number of days between January 1st and March 14th is 73 days. But when you calculate the number of days between January 1st and March 14th, you have to consider that the difference is 72 days. Wait, maybe the confusion is between inclusive and exclusive. So if you have two dates, the number of days between them is (end date - start date). So if January 1st is day 0, then March 14th is day 72. So the difference is 72 days. But when you add the days in each month, you have 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 14 (Mar) = 73 days. But that would be the total number of days from January 1st to March 14th inclusive. So if you want the number of days between January 1st and March 14th, it's 72 days. So the correct way is to take 72 days. So 72 divided by 7 is 10*7=70, remainder 2. So 72 days later is 2 days after Sunday. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. But according to the other approach, it's Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the mistake is in the second approach. Let me check again. If February 1st is Wednesday (day 31), then February 28th is 28 days later. 28 days is 4 weeks, so same day. So February 28th is Wednesday. Then March 1st is Thursday. Then March 14th is 14 days later. 14 days is 2 weeks, so same day. So March 14th is Thursday. But according to the first approach, it's Tuesday. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check the day of the week for March 14th. Let's take a real example. For example, if January 1st is a Sunday, then let's check what day is March 14th. Let's take a real year. For example, 2023. Wait, but in 2023, January 1st is a Sunday. Let me check what day March 14th is in 2023. Wait, March 14th, 2023 is a Tuesday. Wait, but according to the second approach, it would be Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Let me check. Wait, 2023: January 1st is Sunday. Let me check March 14th. Let me count the days. January has 31 days. So January 1st is Sunday. Then January 8th is Sunday, 15th is Sunday, 22nd is Sunday, 29th is Sunday. Then February 5th is Sunday. February has 28 days, so February 28th is 28 days after February 1st. Wait, but if January 1st is Sunday, then February 1st is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So February 1st is Wednesday. Then February 28th is 28 days later, which is 4 weeks, so Wednesday again. Then March 1st is Thursday. Then March 14th is 14 days later, which is Thursday again. But according to actual calendar, March 14th, 2023 is a Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting. So there's a problem here. So either my calculation is wrong, or my assumption that 2023 is a year where January 1st is Sunday is wrong. Wait, let me check. Let me check the actual day of the week for January 1, 2023. According to online sources, January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Then March 14, 2023 was a Tuesday. So according to that, my calculation is wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let's recalculate. If January 1st is Sunday. Then January 1st is day 0. Then January 8th is day 7 (Sunday). January 15th is day 14 (Sunday). January 22nd is day 21 (Sunday). January 29th is day 28 (Sunday). Then February 5th is day 35 (Sunday). February 1st is day 31. So day 31 is February 1st. Let's check what day that is. January 1st is Sunday. 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, remainder 3. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So February 1st is Wednesday. Then February 28th is 28 days later. 28 days is 4 weeks, so same day. So February 28th is Wednesday. Then March 1st is Thursday. Then March 14th is 14 days later. 14 days is 2 weeks, so same day. So March 14th is Thursday. But according to actual calendar, March 14, 2023 is Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. But why?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the actual calendar. Let me check again. Let me check March 14, 2023. According to the calendar, March 14, 2023 is a Tuesday. But according to my calculation, it should be Thursday. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days between January 1st and March 14th. Let me count the days step by step. January 1st is Sunday. Let's count the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 14th is 14 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 31 + 28 + 14 = 73 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then March 14th is day 72.

May has 31 days, so that's correct.\n\nNow, if May 1 is Sunday, then the first Thursday of May would be May 4th (since May 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, 3 is Tuesday, 4 is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, Sunday is day 1. Then Monday is 2, Tuesday 3, Wednesday 4, Thursday 5. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday. So the first Thursday is the 5th. Then the next Thursday would be the 12th, 19th, 26th. Then the next one would be the 3rd of June. But since we're only looking for May, the last Thursday in May would be the 26th. Wait, but wait, May has 31 days. Let me count again. If the first Thursday is the 5th, then adding 7 days each time: 5, 12, 19, 26. Then the next one would be 3rd June. So the last Thursday in May is the 26th. Therefore, the answer should be 26. But wait, I need to make sure that May 1 is indeed a Sunday. Because if that's wrong, then the entire calculation is off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's think about the fact that May 2022 had a certain number of days. For example, if I know that May 2022 had a certain number of Thursdays. Wait, but how? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in 2022, the last day of May is May 31. Let me check what day of the week that was. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 31 is 30 days later. Since 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Sunday would be Tuesday. So May 31, 2022, was a Tuesday. Therefore, the last Thursday would be two days before that. So May 29 is Monday, May 30 is Tuesday, May 31 is Wednesday? Wait, that contradicts. Wait, if May 31 is Tuesday, then May 30 is Monday, May 29 is Sunday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf May 1 is Sunday, then May 1 is day 1 (Sunday). Then May 8 is also Sunday, May 15, 22, 29. So May 29 is Sunday. Then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the last Thursday in May would be the 26th. Because May 26 is Thursday (since 26th is 25 days after May 1. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So Sunday + 4 days is Thursday. So May 26 is Thursday. Then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. So yes, the last Thursday is the 26th. Therefore, the answer is 26. But wait, the question says \"if an event recurs on the last Thursday\", so the answer is 26. But I need to make sure that May 1, 2022, was indeed a Sunday. Because if that's wrong, then the answer is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. For example, I know that April 2022 had 30 days. Let me think about April 1, 2022. If April 1 was a Friday, then May 1 would be a Friday plus 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Friday would be Sunday. So that would make May 1 a Sunday. So that's consistent. So if April 1 was a Friday, then May 1 is Sunday. But how do I know April 1, 2022, was a Friday? Well, I can check that. For example, I know that March 31, 2022, was a Thursday. Because March 2022 had 31 days. Let me think. If March 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Wait, I think March 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Then March 1 is Tuesday, March 8 is Tuesday, March 15, 22, 29. Then March 30 is Wednesday, March 31 is Thursday. So April 1, 2022, would be Friday. Therefore, that's correct. So April 1 is Friday, May 1 is Sunday. Therefore, the calculation is correct. Therefore, the last Thursday in May is the 26th. So the answer is 26.\n</think>", "26"], [124, "Is 2098 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2098 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2098. First, divide 2098 by 4. Let's do the division. 4 times 524 is 2096, so 2098 minus 2096 is 2. That means 2098 divided by 4 is 524.5. Since there's a remainder, 2098 is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check again. Let me add 4 to 2096, which is 2100. So 2098 is two years before 2100. So 2098 divided by 4 is 524.5, which is not an integer. Therefore, 2098 is not divisible by 4. \n\nSince it's not divisible by 4, regardless of whether it's a century year or not, it can't be a leap year. But wait, is 2098 a century year? Century years are those divisible by 100. 2098 divided by 100 is 20.98, so no. So it's not a century year. Therefore, the first condition (divisible by 4) isn't met, so it's not a leap year. \n\nSo the answer should be No.\n</think>", "No"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, February 6 to Friday, March 4, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays directly. But maybe the first approach is better.\n\nWait, but how do I find the total days? Let me check the dates. Let's start by checking the dates. February 6, 2022 is a Sunday. Then March 4 is a Friday. Let me check how many days are in between.\n\nFirst, let's check how many days are in February 2022. Since 2022 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. So from February 6 to February 28 inclusive, how many days? Let's calculate that. February 6 to February 28 is 28 - 6 + 1 = 23 days. Wait, because if you include both start and end dates, it's (end - start) + 1. So 28 - 6 = 22, plus 1 is 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total days from February 6 to March 4 inclusive is 23 + 4 = 27 days. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nFebruary 6 is day 1 (Sunday). Then February 7 is Monday, and so on. Let me check the dates. Let me think of the days in February. Let's see, February 6 is Sunday. Then February 7 is Monday, 8 Tuesday, 9 Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday, 13 Sunday, 14 Monday, etc. So from February 6 to February 28: Let's count how many days. Let's see, February 6 is day 1. Then February 28 is 28 - 6 = 22 days later. So adding 1 day for the start date, that's 22 + 1 = 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total days is 23 + 4 = 27 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 27 days.\n\nNow, out of these 27 days, how many are weekends? Let's see. The start date is Sunday (Feb 6), which is a weekend. The end date is Friday (March 4), which is a weekday. So the weekends in this period would be Sundays and Saturdays. Let's count them.\n\nFirst, let's list the days from February 6 to March 4. Let's start with February 6 (Sunday). Then February 7 (Monday), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), and then March 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri). Wait, but wait, March 4 is the end date. Let me check if that's correct. Wait, February 28 is the last day of February. Then March 1 is the next day. So March 1 is a Monday? Wait, let me check the days again. Let me check the actual calendar for 2022.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual days. Let me think. February 6, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me check what day March 4 is. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to calculate. Let me check the days step by step.\n\nStarting from February 6 (Sunday):\n\nFebruary 6: Sun\n\n7: Mon\n\n8: Tue\n\n9: Wed\n\n10: Thu\n\n11: Fri\n\n12: Sat\n\n13: Sun\n\n14: Mon\n\n15: Tue\n\n16: Wed\n\n17: Thu\n\n18: Fri\n\n19: Sat\n\n20: Sun\n\n21: Mon\n\n22: Tue\n\n23: Wed\n\n24: Thu\n\n25: Fri\n\n26: Sat\n\n27: Sun\n\n28: Mon\n\nMarch 1: Tue\n\nMarch 2: Wed\n\nMarch 3: Thu\n\nMarch 4: Fri\n\nSo that's correct. So from February 6 to March 4, the days are as listed. Now, the weekends are Saturdays and Sundays. Let's count how many Saturdays and Sundays are in this period.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nSaturdays are on 12, 19, 26. That's three Saturdays.\n\nSundays are on 6, 13, 20, 27. That's four Sundays.\n\nSo total weekends are 3 + 4 = 7 days. Therefore, the total number of weekdays would be total days (27) minus weekends (7) = 20 weekdays.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the weekdays directly. Let's go through each day:\n\nFebruary 6: Sunday (weekend)\n\n7: Monday (weekday)\n\n8: Tuesday (weekday)\n\n9: Wednesday (weekday)\n\n10: Thursday (weekday)\n\n11: Friday (weekday)\n\n12: Saturday (weekend)\n\n13: Sunday (weekend)\n\n14: Monday (weekday)\n\n15: Tuesday (weekday)\n\n16: Wednesday (weekday)\n\n17: Thursday (weekday)\n\n18: Friday (weekday)\n\n19: Saturday (weekend)\n\n20: Sunday (weekend)\n\n21: Monday (weekday)\n\n22: Tuesday (weekday)\n\n23: Wednesday (weekday)\n\n24: Thursday (weekday)\n\n25: Friday (weekday)\n\n26: Saturday (weekend)\n\n27: Sunday (weekend)\n\n28: Monday (weekday)\n\nMarch 1: Tuesday (weekday)\n\n2: Wednesday (weekday)\n\n3: Thursday (weekday)\n\n4: Friday (weekday)\n\nNow, let's count the weekdays. Let's go through each day:\n\nFrom Feb 6 to March 4:\n\nWeekdays are the days that are not Saturday or Sunday. Let's count them:\n\nFeb 7 (Mon) - 1\n\nFeb 8 (Tue) - 2\n\nFeb 9 (Wed) -3\n\nFeb 10 (Thu) -4\n\nFeb 11 (Fri) -5\n\nFeb 14 (Mon) -6\n\nFeb 15 (Tue) -7\n\nFeb 16 (Wed) -8\n\nFeb 17 (Thu) -9\n\nFeb 18 (Fri) -10\n\nFeb 21 (Mon) -11\n\nFeb 22 (Tue) -12\n\nFeb 23 (Wed) -13\n\nFeb 24 (Thu) -14\n\nFeb 25 (Fri) -15\n\nFeb 28 (Mon) -16\n\nMarch 1 (Tue) -17\n\nMarch 2 (Wed) -18\n\nMarch 3 (Thu) -19\n\nMarch 4 (Fri) -20\n\nSo that's 20 weekdays.

Provide the count as a number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many Mondays there are between June 12, 2022 (Sunday) and July 28, 2022 (Thursday), inclusive. Hmm. So first, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those days are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates or find the first and last day of the week in that range. Let me start by checking what day June 12, 2022 was. The problem says it's a Sunday. So June 12 is Sunday. Then June 13 is Monday. So the first Monday in the period is June 13. Then I need to count all the Mondays from June 13 up to July 28, which is a Thursday. Wait, but July 28 is a Thursday, so the last day of the period is Thursday. So the last Monday would be July 25, because July 25 is a Monday, and then July 26 is Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday. So that's the last Monday in the range.\n\nSo now I need to count how many Mondays are between June 13 and July 25 inclusive. Let me figure out how many weeks there are in that period. Let's calculate the total number of days between June 12 and July 28 inclusive. Wait, but maybe I can find the total days first. Let me check.\n\nJune has 30 days. So from June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since June 12 is included, it's 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, if I have June 12 (day 1) to June 13 (day 2), that's 2 days. So from June 12 to June 30 inclusive, that's 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total days from June 12 to July 28 inclusive is 19 + 28 = 47 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, June 12 to June 30 is 19 days (since 30-12=18, plus 1 is 19). Then July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total is 19 + 28 = 47 days. So 47 days in total.\n\nNow, since the first day is Sunday (June 12), then the next day is Monday (June 13). So the first Monday is day 2. Then each week has 7 days. So the number of Mondays would be the total days divided by 7, but adjusted for the starting day. Alternatively, since the first day is Sunday, the first Monday is day 2. So the number of Mondays would be the ceiling of (total days - 1)/7? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the first day is Sunday, then the number of Mondays is equal to the number of weeks in the period plus 1 if the period starts on a Sunday and ends on a Monday or later. Wait, maybe I need to calculate how many full weeks there are and then check the remaining days.\n\nTotal days is 47. 47 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 5 days. Because 6*7=42, 47-42=5. So there are 6 full weeks and 5 days remaining. Since the first day is Sunday, the first day of the period is Sunday, so the first week has 7 days (June 12 to June 18, which is Sunday to Saturday). Then the next week is June 19 to June 25, and so on. Wait, but the total days are 47. So 6 weeks is 42 days. Then the remaining 5 days would be days 43 to 47. Let me check: day 1 is June 12 (Sunday), day 2 is June 13 (Monday), day 43 would be day 42 + 1. Day 42 is the end of the 6th week. Let me see, day 42 would be June 12 + 41 days. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since the first day is Sunday, the first Monday is day 2. Then each subsequent Monday is 7 days later. So the Mondays would be on days 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44. Let me count how many that is. Let's see:\n\nStarting from day 2 (June 13), adding 7 each time:\n\n2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44. Then the next would be 51, which is beyond 47. So that's 7 Mondays. But wait, the total days are 47. So day 44 is the 44th day. Then day 44 is 44 days after June 12. Let me check what date that is. June 12 + 44 days. June has 30 days, so 30 - 12 = 18 days remaining in June. So 44 days would be 18 days in June (June 12 to June 30) plus 26 days in July. So June 30 is day 19, then July 1 is day 20, July 2 is 21, ..., July 26 is day 20 + 25 = day 45. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I need to calculate day 44. Let me think again.\n\nJune 12 is day 1. Then June 13 is day 2. June 14 is day 3, ..., June 19 is day 8 (since 12 + 7 days is 19). Then June 20 is day 9. Wait, no. Wait, day 1 is June 12. Then day 2 is June 13. So day 8 is June 19 (Sunday). Then day 9 is June 20 (Monday). Wait, but that would mean that the first Monday is day 2 (June 13), then day 9 (June 20), day 16 (June 27), day 23 (July 4), day 30 (July 11), day 37 (July 18), day 44 (July 25). Then day 44 is July 25. Then day 45 is July 26 (Tuesday), day 46 July 27 (Wednesday), day 47 July 28 (Thursday). So yes, the last Monday is July 25, which is day 44. So that's 7 Mondays. So the answer is 7?\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me count the Mondays manually. Let's list the dates:\n\nJune 13 (Monday), June 20, June 27, July 4, July 11, July 18, July 25. That's 7 Mondays. So that's correct. So the answer is 7. But wait, the problem says between June 12 and July 28 inclusive. So June 12 is Sunday, and July 28 is Thursday. So the Mondays are from June 13 to July 25. So that's 7 Mondays. Therefore, the answer is 7. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any other Monday that I missed. Let me check each month.\n\nJune has 30 days. June 13 is Monday. Then adding 7 days: June 20, 27. Then July 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 7 Mondays. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is 7.

Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days, then adjust for weekends.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down month by month. Let's start with January 24, 2022, which is a Monday. Then go through each month until March 22.\n\nJanuary 24 to January 31: Let's count the days. January 24 is Monday.

So from February 1 to February 28. But I need to check if the start date is February 1 or not. Wait, the original period starts on January 24, so the next month is February.

Let's see how many weeks that is. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks. So 4 weeks * 5 business days = 20 business days. Wait, but wait, each week has 5 business days. So 4 weeks would be 20. But since February 1 is a Tuesday, and 28 days later is February 28, which is also a Tuesday. So that's exactly 4 weeks. So 20 business days in February. That seems right.\n\nThen March 2022. The end date is March 22, 2022. Let's check what day March 22 is. Since February 28 is a Tuesday (since February 1 is Tuesday, 28 days later is Tuesday again). Then March 1 is Wednesday.

But according to my calculation, March 22 is a Wednesday. That suggests that there's an error in my previous steps. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, January 24, 2022, is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Let me check an actual calendar. Wait, I can't access external resources, but I can calculate based on known dates. For example, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday. Wait, that would make January 3 a Monday. Wait, but that contradicts the original problem's statement that January 24 is a Monday. Wait, maybe I need to check that again.\n\nWait, if January 1, 2022, was a Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday. Then January 3 is Monday. Then January 24 would be 24 days later. Let's calculate 24 days from January 3. 24 days is 3 weeks (21 days) plus 3 days. So January 3 + 21 days is January 24. So adding 3 days: January 24 is Monday, 25 Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So that's correct. So January 24 is Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday.

Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption about January 1, 2022, being a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. Wait, I think I might have confused the actual day. Let me think again. Let's take a known date. For example, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. Because 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 started on a Saturday. Wait, no. Wait, 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021, was a Friday, then January 1, 2022, would be a Saturday. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for a specific date. For example, January 1, 2022, is a Saturday. Let me check that. Let me think of another way. For example, January 1, 2023, is a Sunday. So 2022 is one year before that. So 2022 would be 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 starts on Saturday. So January 1, 2022, is a Saturday. Therefore, January 3 is Monday. Then January 24 is 24 days after January 3. Let's calculate that. 24 days is 3 weeks (21 days) plus 3 days. So January 3 + 21 days is January 24. Then adding 3 days: January 24 is Monday, 25 Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So that's correct. So January 24 is Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 28 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 22 is Wednesday. But the problem says the end date is Tuesday, March 22. That's conflicting. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement, or my calculation is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the day count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the day calculation. Let me check again. Let's count the days from March 1 to March 22. March 1 is Wednesday. March 2 is Thursday, March 3 is Friday, March 4 is Saturday, March 5 is Sunday, March 6 is Monday, March 7 is Tuesday, March 8 is Wednesday, March 9 is Thursday, March 10 is Friday, March 11 is Saturday, March 12 is Sunday, March 13 is Monday, March 14 is Tuesday, March 15 is Wednesday, March 16 is Thursday, March 17 is Friday, March 18 is Saturday, March 19 is Sunday, March 20 is Monday, March 21 is Tuesday, March 22 is Wednesday. So March 22 is Wednesday. Therefore, the problem's end date is Tuesday, March 22. That's conflicting. Therefore, maybe the problem has a typo, or I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Alternatively, maybe the start date is not January 24, but another date. Wait, the problem says \"from Monday, January 24, 2022 to Tuesday, March 22, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)\". So the end date is Tuesday, March 22. But according to my calculation, March 22 is a Wednesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let me check the number of days between January 24 and March 22, inclusive. Let's calculate the total days first. January has 31 days. So from January 24 to January 31 is 8 days (including both). Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. So total days is 8 + 28 + 22 = 58 days. Wait, but that's 58 days total. But if the end date is March 22, which is a Wednesday, then the total days would be 58. But according to the problem, the end date is Tuesday. Therefore, there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption about the day of the week for January 24 is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check the actual day of the week for March 22, 2022. Let me think. If I can find the day of the week for a known date. For example, March 1, 2022, is a Wednesday. Then March 2 is Thursday, March 3 is Friday, March 4 is Saturday, March 5 is Sunday, March 6 is Monday, March 7 is Tuesday, March 8 is Wednesday, March 9 is Thursday, March 10 is Friday, March 11 is Saturday, March 12 is Sunday, March 13 is Monday, March 14 is Tuesday, March 15 is Wednesday, March 16 is Thursday, March 17 is Friday, March 18 is Saturday, March 19 is Sunday, March 20 is Monday, March 21 is Tuesday, March 22 is Wednesday. So March 22 is Wednesday. Therefore, the problem's end date is Tuesday, March 22. That's conflicting. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Alternatively, maybe the start date is not January 24, but another date. Wait, the problem says \"Monday, January 24, 2022\". Let me check that. Let me check the actual day of the week for January 24, 2022. If January 1, 2022, is a Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday. Then January 3 is Monday. Then January 24 is 24 days after January 3. 24 days is 3 weeks and 3 days. So January 3 + 3 weeks is January 24 (since 3*7=21 days). Then adding 3 days: January 24 is Monday, 25 Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So that's correct. Therefore, January 24 is Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 28 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. So March 22 is Wednesday. Therefore, the problem's end date is Tuesday, March 22. That's impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check again. Wait, maybe the end date is March 22, 2022, which is a Tuesday. But according to my calculation, it's a Wednesday. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the day count. Let me check again. Let me count the days from March 1 to March 22. March 1 is Wednesday. March 2 is Thursday. March 3 is Friday. March 4 is Saturday. March 5 is Sunday. March 6 is Monday. March 7 is Tuesday. March 8 is Wednesday. March 9 is Thursday. March 10 is Friday. March 11 is Saturday. March 12 is Sunday. March 13 is Monday. March 14 is Tuesday. March 15 is Wednesday. March 16 is Thursday. March 17 is Friday. March 18 is Saturday. March 19 is Sunday. March 20 is Monday. March 21 is Tuesday. March 22 is Wednesday. So that's correct. Therefore, March 22 is Wednesday. Therefore, the problem's end date is Tuesday, March 22. That's conflicting. Therefore, maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the start date is not January 24, but another date. Alternatively, maybe the end date is March 21, 2022. But the problem says March 22. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the calculation assuming that the end date is March 22, even if it's a Wednesday. But the problem says it's a Tuesday. Therefore, perhaps I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for January 24. Let me check another way. Let me check the day of the week for January 24, 2022, using another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, is a Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday. Then January 4 is Tuesday, January 5 is Wednesday, January 6 is Thursday, January 7 is Friday, January 8 is Saturday, January 9 is Sunday, January 10 is Monday, and so on. Let me count the days from January 1 to January 24. January 1 is Saturday. January 24 is 23 days later. 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Therefore, January 24 is Monday. That's correct. Therefore, the problem's end date is Tuesday, March 22. But according to my calculation, March 22 is Wednesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the end date is March 22, 2022, which is a Tuesday. But according to my calculation, it's a Wednesday. Therefore, I need to resolve this discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the calculation, assuming that the end date is correct as per the problem statement. Let me try to find the correct day of the week for March 22, 2022. Let me check using another approach. Let me check the day of the week for March 22, 2022, by using the fact that March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 22 is 21 days later. 2"], [124, "Count forward 99 days from Monday, December 26, 2022 - what's the weekday? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week it will be 99 days after Monday, December 26, 2022. Let me start by breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I know that December 26, 2022 is a Monday. The question is asking for the weekday 99 days later. To find the weekday, I can use the fact that each week has 7 days. So, if I divide 99 by 7, the remainder will tell me how many days ahead I need to count from Monday.\n\nLet me do the division: 99 divided by 7. 7 times 14 is 98, so 99 divided by 7 is 14 weeks with a remainder of 1 day. Because 14 weeks is exactly 98 days, adding 1 more day to Monday would be Tuesday. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check again. 7*14=98, so 99-98=1. So the remainder is 1. So adding 1 day to Monday would be Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this with another method. Let me count the days step by step. Let's start from December 26, 2022 (Monday). Let's count 7 days ahead: December 26 + 7 days is January 2, 2023, which is also a Monday. Then adding another 7 days would be January 9, 2023, Monday again. So every 7 days, the same weekday. So 14 weeks would be 98 days, which would be December 26 + 98 days. Then adding one more day would be 99 days. So 98 days later is Monday again, then 99 days is Tuesday. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the days? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year. So February has 28 days. But since we're starting in December, and adding 99 days, maybe the date would be in January 2023? Let me check the actual dates. December has 31 days. So December 26 + 5 days is December 31, 2022. Then adding 94 days (since 99-5=94) would be January 24, 2023? Wait, maybe I should calculate the exact date to check if the number of days is correct. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I can check the remainder again. Since 99 divided by 7 is 14 with remainder 1, so adding 1 day to Monday is Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday. But I need to make sure that the remainder is correct. Let me check 7*14=98, 98+1=99. Yes. So the remainder is 1. So the weekday is Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another approach. Let me think. For example, if I count 99 days from Monday, December 26, 2022. Let's count the days in months. December has 31 days. So from December 26 to December 31 is 5 days (since 31-26=5). Then January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, etc. But maybe that's too tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. So the same day plus 1 day. So Monday + 1 day is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. I think that's correct. But maybe I should check with an online calendar or something. Wait, but since I can't do that, I have to rely on my calculations. So I think the answer is Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Thursday, September 15 to Saturday, November 26, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Express your answer as a number.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between Thursday, September 15 and Saturday, November 26, 2022, inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, right? So weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days and then subtract the weekends. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down month by month. Let's check each month from September to November 2022.\n\nStarting with September. The start date is September 15, which is a Thursday. Let me check what day of the week each date is. Wait, maybe I need to know the days in each month. September has 30 days. So from September 15 to September 30. Let's count the days in September.\n\nSeptember 15 is Thursday. Then September 16 is Friday, 17 Saturday, 18 Sunday, 19 Monday, 20 Tuesday, 21 Wednesday, 22 Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday, 25 Sunday, 26 Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. So September has 30 days. So from September 15 to September 30, that's 16 days (since 30-15+1=16 days). Wait, but let me check: 15th is day 1, 16th day 2, ..., 30th is day 16. So that's correct.\n\nNow, in September, the weekdays are from 15th (Thursday) to 30th (Friday). Let's count the weekdays in September. Let's list the days:\n\nSeptember 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri).\n\nSo from 15th to 30th, how many weekdays? Let's count the Thursdays, Fridays, Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays. Let's see:\n\nThursdays: 15, 22, 29. That's 3 days.\n\nFridays: 16, 23, 30. 3 days.\n\nMondays: 19, 26. 2 days.\n\nTuesdays: 20, 27. 2 days.\n\nWednesdays: 21, 28. 2 days.\n\nTotal in September: 3+3+2+2+2= 12 weekdays. Wait, but wait, let me check again. Wait, September 15 is Thursday. So the first week in September: 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed). Then the next week starts on 22 (Thu). So from 15 to 30, that's two full weeks (14 days) plus two days (29 and 30). Wait, but 15 to 30 is 16 days. So two weeks (14 days) would be 14 days, then two more days. So in the first two weeks (15-28), how many weekdays? Let's see:\n\nFrom 15-28: 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed). So that's 14 days. Weekdays here are 15,16,19,20,21,22,23,26,27,28. Wait, that's 10 weekdays. Wait, but earlier when I counted, I had 3 Thursdays (15,22,29), but 29 is in the next week. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the first two weeks (15-28), the weekdays are:\n\nThursdays: 15, 22.\n\nFridays: 16, 23.\n\nMondays: 19, 26.\n\nTuesdays: 20, 27.\n\nWednesdays: 21, 28.\n\nSo that's 2+2+2+2+2= 10 weekdays. Then the remaining two days are 29 (Thu) and 30 (Fri). So adding those two, that's 2 more weekdays. So total 12 weekdays in September. So that's correct. So September has 12 weekdays.\n\nNow moving on to October. October has 31 days. Let's check the dates. The next month is October. But the end date is November 26. So I need to check October's weekdays. But what day is October 1, 2022? Wait, I need to know the days of the week for October. Wait, September 30 is a Friday. So October 1 is a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Because September 15 is Thursday. Then September 16 is Friday, 17 Saturday, 18 Sunday, 19 Monday, 20 Tuesday, 21 Wednesday, 22 Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday, 25 Sunday, 26 Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. So yes, September 30 is Friday. Therefore, October 1 is Saturday. So October starts on Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday, 4 Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, etc.\n\nSo October has 31 days. Let's count the weekdays in October. Since October 1 is Saturday, the first week of October has 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri). So the first week has 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri). Then the next weeks. Let's see how many weeks there are in October. 31 days. So 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, then 3 days left. So the total weekdays would be 4 weeks * 5 weekdays = 20, plus the weekdays in the remaining 3 days. The remaining days are October 29 (Sat?), wait, wait. Wait, October 1 is Saturday. So October 29 is Saturday (since 29-1=28 days, which is 4 weeks, so same day as October 1). So October 29 is Saturday, 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday. So the remaining three days are 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon). So the weekdays in those three days are only Monday (31st). So total weekdays in October would be 20 + 1 = 21. Wait, but wait, let me check again. Because in the first week (Oct 1-7), the weekdays are 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri). That's 5 weekdays. Then the next weeks: 8-14 (Sat-Sun, Mon-Fri), 15-21 (Sat-Sun, Mon-Fri), 22-28 (Sat-Sun, Mon-Fri), 29-31 (Sat, Sun, Mon). So each of the first three weeks (weeks 2,3,4) have 5 weekdays. Then the last week (week 5) has 1 weekday (Monday). So total is 5 + 5 +5 +5 +1? Wait, no. Wait, the first week (Oct 1-7) has 5 weekdays. Then weeks 2-4 (Oct 8-28) would be 3 weeks, each with 5 weekdays. Then the last three days (29-31) have 1 weekday. So total is 5 + 3*5 +1 = 5 +15 +1=21. Yes. So October has 21 weekdays.\n\nNow November. November 1, 2022. Let's check what day that is. October 31 is Monday. So November 1 is Tuesday. Let me confirm. October 31 is Monday, so November 1 is Tuesday. So November starts on Tuesday. Now, the end date is November 26. So November has 30 days. Let's count the weekdays from November 1 to November 26. Let's see. November 1 is Tuesday. So the days in November:\n\nNovember 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat). Wait, but the end date is November 26, which is Saturday. So the period is from November 1 to November 26. Let's count the weekdays in November. Let's see:\n\nFirst, November 1 is Tuesday. So the first week (Nov 1-7) has weekdays: 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 7 (Mon). That's 5 weekdays. Then the next weeks: 8-14 (Tue-Sun, Mon-Fri), 15-21 (Tue-Sun, Mon-Fri), 22-28 (Tue-Sun, Mon-Fri), and then 29-26? Wait, November 26 is the end date. Wait, November has 30 days. So from November 1 to 26 is 26 days. Let's break it down. Let's see how many weeks and days that is. 26 days is 3 weeks (21 days) and 5 days. So 3 weeks would be 3*5=15 weekdays. Then the remaining 5 days (Nov 22-26) are: 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat). So the weekdays here are 22,23,24,25. That's 4 weekdays. So total weekdays in November would be 15 +4=19? Wait, but wait, let me check again. Because the first week (Nov 1-7) has 5 weekdays. Then weeks 2 (8-14) has 5 weekdays, week 3 (15-21) has 5 weekdays, and then week 4 (22-28) has 5 weekdays. But since we only go up to 26, which is part of week 4. So from 22-26 is 5 days. So in week 4, the weekdays are 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat). So the weekdays are 22,23,24,25. So 4 weekdays. So total is 5 (week 1) +5 (week 2) +5 (week3) +4 (week4) = 19. But wait, that's 5+5+5+4=19. But wait, the first week (1-7) is 5 weekdays. Then weeks 2-4 (8-28) would be 3 weeks, each with 5 weekdays. But since we only go up to 26, which is part of week 4. So 5+5+5+4=19. But wait, maybe I should count each day. Let me list the days from Nov 1 to Nov 26:\n\nNov 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat).\n\nNow, count the weekdays (Mon-Fri):\n\nWeek 1: 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 7 (Mon). That's 5.\n\nWeek 2: 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 14 (Mon). 5.\n\nWeek 3: 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 21 (Mon). 5.\n\nWeek 4: 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat). So weekdays are 22,23,24,25. 4.\n\nTotal: 5+5+5+4=19. So November has 19 weekdays.\n\nSo total weekdays from September (12) + October (21) + November (19) = 12+21=33, 33+19=52. Wait, but wait, the start date is September 15, which is included, and the end date is November 26, which is included. But in my calculation, for September, I included all days from 15 to 30, which is correct. For October, all 31 days, and November up to 26. So total is 12+21+19=52. But wait, let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the count for September. Let me check again. September had 12 weekdays. October 21, November 19. 12+21=33, 33+19=52. But wait, maybe I need to check if there's an error in the counts. Let me check another way. Let's calculate the total number of days between September 15 and November 26, inclusive, then subtract the weekends.\n\nTotal days: Let's calculate the number of days from September 15 to November 26. September has 30 days, so from 15 to 30 is 16 days. October has 31 days. November has 26 days. So total days is 16 + 31 + 26 = 73 days. Wait, but that's 16 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 26 (Nov) = 73 days. But if I check the actual dates, from September 15 to November 26 inclusive, that's 73 days. Now, the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period. Then total weekdays would be 73 minus the number of weekends.\n\nBut how many weekends are there? Let's calculate that. Alternatively, maybe I can check if my previous total of 52 is correct. 73 total days minus weekends. Let's see. If 52 weekdays, then 73-52=21 weekends. Let me check if that's possible. But maybe I can calculate the number of weekends in each month.\n\nIn September: from 15 to 30. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays. September 15 is Thursday. So the first Saturday is 17 (Sep 17), Sunday 18. Then next Saturday is 24, Sunday 25. Then Saturday 31? Wait, September 30 is Friday. So in September, the Saturdays are 17, 24. Sundays are 18, 25. So that's 2 Saturdays and 2 Sundays. So 4 weekend days. So in September, 4 weekend days. So total days in September is 16. 16-4=12 weekdays. Which matches my previous count. So that's correct.\n\nIn October: 31 days. October starts on Saturday. So the first week has Saturday (1), Sunday (2). Then the next weeks. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays. October has 31 days. Let's see:\n\nSaturdays in October: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Saturdays. Sundays: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5 Sundays. So total 10 weekend days. So 31 days - 10 = 21 weekdays. Which matches my previous count. So that's correct.\n\nIn November: from November 1 to 26"], [124, "Is 2055 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2055 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2055. First, divide 2055 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2055 minus 2000 is 55. 55 divided by 4 is 13.75. So 2055 divided by 4 is 513.75. That means 2055 is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check again. Let me add 4 to 2052, which is a leap year. 2052 + 4 is 2056. So 2056 is a leap year. Then 2055 would be one year before that, so not a leap year. But maybe I should confirm the division.\n\nAlternatively, 2055 divided by 4: 4 times 500 is 2000, 4 times 13 is 52, so 500 + 13 is 513, 513 times 4 is 2052. Then 2055 minus 2052 is 3. So remainder 3. Therefore, 2055 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it's not a leap year.

Let me divide 46 by 7. 7 times 6 is 42, which leaves a remainder of 4. So 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days. Since 6 weeks later would be the same day of the week, adding 4 days to Wednesday should give me the answer.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. If I start on Wednesday, adding 7 days would be the same day, right? So adding 6 weeks (42 days) would still be Wednesday. Then adding the remaining 4 days. So Wednesday plus 1 day is Thursday, plus 2 is Friday, plus 3 is Saturday, plus 4 is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the date? Wait, February 2, 2022. 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're starting on February 2, adding 46 days... Let me check if the date calculation is correct. Maybe I should count the days step by step to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Since the days repeat every 7 days, the weekday can be found by taking 46 mod 7. 46 divided by 7 is 6 with remainder 4, so 46 mod 7 is 4. So adding 4 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. That seems consistent.\n\nBut maybe I should verify with actual dates. Let's try to count. Starting from February 2, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count 46 days forward. Let me break it down into months. February has 28 days, so from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since 28 - 2 = 26). Wait, no. Wait, from February 2 to February 28 is 28 - 2 = 26 days, but if I include the starting day, maybe I need to adjust. Wait, if I start on day 0 as February 2, then adding 26 days would take me to February 28. But maybe I should count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try another approach. Let's count the days in each month. Let's see, starting from February 2, 2022. Let's add days step by step.\n\nFirst, February has 28 days. So from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since 28 - 2 = 26). Then March has 31 days, April has 30, May 31, etc. But since 46 days is less than 28 + 31 + 30 + ...? Wait, maybe I should just add the days step by step.\n\nWait, starting from February 2, adding 26 days would take me to February 28. Then adding 20 more days (since 26 + 20 = 46). So February 28 is the 26th day. Then March has 31 days. So adding 20 days to February 28 would be March 28 (since 28 + 20 = 48, but wait, March has 31 days. Wait, February 28 plus 1 day is March 1. So adding 20 days to February 28 would be March 1 + 19 days. March has 31 days, so March 1 + 19 days is March 20. Wait, that's 20 days. So February 28 + 20 days is March 20. So the 46th day is March 20, 2022. Now, what day of the week is March 20, 2022?\n\nBut wait, I need to check if that's correct. Let me check again. From February 2 to February 28 is 26 days. Then adding 20 days would be 26 + 20 = 46. So yes, March 20. Now, if February 2 is a Wednesday, then February 28 is 26 days later. Since 26 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 5 days is Monday. Wait, Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 Friday, +3 Saturday, +4 Sunday, +5 Monday. So February 28 is a Monday. Then adding 20 days to that. Let's see, 20 days later. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Monday. Monday + 6 days is Sunday. So March 20 would be a Sunday. That matches my previous calculation. So the answer is Sunday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's count the days from Wednesday, February 2. Let's count 7 days: February 9 is Wednesday. Then 16, 23, 30. Then March 8 (47 days later). Wait, but 46 days would be March 7. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous result. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if February 2 is day 0 (Wednesday), then adding 7 days is February 9 (Wednesday). Then 16 (Wednesday), 23 (Wednesday), 30 (Wednesday). Then March 8 is 37 days later (since 23 + 14 days is March 8). Wait, 23 + 7 is 30, then 30 + 7 is March 7? Wait, no. Wait, February 23 is Wednesday. Adding 7 days is March 2 (since February has 28 days, so 23 + 7 is March 2). Then March 2 is Wednesday. Then March 9 is Wednesday, March 16, March 23, March 30. Wait, but 46 days from February 2 would be 46 days. Let me count how many weeks and days. 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks (42 days) and 4 days. So 6 weeks later is Wednesday again. Then adding 4 days: Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4). So Sunday. But according to the previous method, March 20 is Sunday. But according to this, March 2 + 4 days is March 6? Wait, no. Wait, if March 2 is Wednesday, then adding 4 days would be March 6 (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday). Wait, that's conflicting with the previous result. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. So which one is right? Let me check again. If February 2 is Wednesday, then adding 7 days is February 9 (Wednesday). Then 16, 23, 30 (February 23 is Wednesday). Then March 2 is 23 + 7 = March 2 (Wednesday). Then March 9 is Wednesday. So March 2 is Wednesday. Then adding 4 days to March 2 would be March 6 (Thursday), March 7 (Friday), March 8 (Saturday), March 9 (Sunday). Wait, that's 4 days. Wait, March 2 + 4 days is March 6? Wait, no. Wait, March 2 is day 0. March 3 is +1, March 4 +2, March 5 +3, March 6 +4. So March 6 is Thursday. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous calculation where March 20 was Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is confusing. There must be a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the first method again. The first method said that 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday is Sunday. But the second method, when counting the days step by step, seems to get a different answer. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the first method. Let me check the date calculation again. If February 2 is Wednesday, then adding 26 days (to February 28) is 26 days. 26 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Wednesday is Monday. So February 28 is Monday. Then adding 20 days to that. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Monday is Sunday. So March 20 is Sunday. But according to the other method, March 6 is Sunday. That's conflicting. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the step-by-step count. Let me check the step-by-step again. Let's count the days from February 2, 2022. Let's list the dates and days:\n\nFebruary 2: Wednesday (day 0)\nFebruary 9: Wednesday (day 7)\nFebruary 16: Wednesday (day 14)\nFebruary 23: Wednesday (day 21)\nFebruary 28: Wednesday + 5 days (day 26) \u2192 Monday (since 21 + 5 = 26)\nMarch 7: Wednesday + 7 days (day 33) \u2192 Wednesday (since 26 + 7 = 33)\nMarch 14: Wednesday (day 40)\nMarch 21: Wednesday (day 47)\nWait, so March 21 is day 47. So day 46 would be March 20. So March 20 is day 46. So if March 21 is Wednesday, then March 20 is Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, this is getting more confusing. \n\nWait, if March 21 is Wednesday (day 47), then March 20 is Tuesday. But earlier, when I calculated adding 20 days to February 28 (Monday), I thought that would be Sunday. But according to this, March 20 is Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is a problem. There's a contradiction here. Let me check again. Let's count the days from February 2 to March 20. Let's see:\n\nFrom February 2 to February 28 is 26 days. Then March 1 to March 20 is 20 days. So total 26 + 20 = 46 days. So March 20 is 46 days after February 2. So if February 28 is Monday (day 26), then March 1 is Tuesday (day 27), March 2 is Wednesday (day 28), March 3 is Thursday (29), March 4 is Friday (30), March 5 is Saturday (31), March 6 is Sunday (32), March 7 is Monday (33), March 8 is Tuesday (34), March 9 is Wednesday (35), March 10 is Thursday (36), March 11 is Friday (37), March 12 is Saturday (38), March 13 is Sunday (39), March 14 is Monday (40), March 15 is Tuesday (41), March 16 is Wednesday (42), March 17 is Thursday (43), March 18 is Friday (44), March 19 is Saturday (45), March 20 is Sunday (46). \n\nWait, so according to this, March 20 is Sunday. But earlier, when I thought March 21 is Wednesday (day 47), that would mean March 20 is Tuesday. But that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the step-by-step count. Let me check again. \n\nIf March 21 is day 47, then March 21 is Wednesday. So March 20 would be Tuesday. But according to the previous count, March 20 is Sunday. So which is correct? \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the day counts. Let me check the day counts again. Let's start from February 2 as day 0 (Wednesday). Then:\n\nDay 0: Feb 2 (Wed)\nDay 1: Feb 3 (Thu)\nDay 2: Feb 4 (Fri)\nDay 3: Feb 5 (Sat)\nDay 4: Feb 6 (Sun)\nDay 5: Feb 7 (Mon)\nDay 6: Feb 8 (Tue)\nDay 7: Feb 9 (Wed)\nDay 8: Feb 10 (Thu)\n... and so on. \n\nSo every 7 days, the day of the week repeats. So day 26 is 26 days after Feb 2. Let's calculate 26 mod 7. 7*3=21, 26-21=5. So day 26 is 5 days after Wednesday. Wednesday +5 days is Monday. So day 26 is Monday (Feb 28). Then day 27 is Tuesday (March 1), day 28 is Wednesday (March 2), day 29 is Thursday (March 3), day 30 is Friday (March 4), day 31 is Saturday (March 5), day 32 is Sunday (March 6), day 33 is Monday (March 7), day 34 is Tuesday (March 8), day 35 is Wednesday (March 9), day 36 is Thursday (March 10), day 37 is Friday (March 11), day 38 is Saturday (March 12), day 39 is Sunday (March 13), day 40 is Monday (March 14), day 41 is Tuesday (March 15), day 42 is Wednesday (March 16), day 43 is Thursday (March 17), day 44 is Friday (March 18), day 45 is Saturday (March 19), day 46 is Sunday (March 20). \n\nSo according to this, March 20 is Sunday. Therefore, the correct answer is Sunday. But earlier when I thought that March 21 is Wednesday (day 47), that would be correct. Because day 47 is March 21. So day 47 is Wednesday. So day 46 is Sunday. Therefore, the correct answer is Sunday. \n\nSo where was the mistake in the previous step-by-step count? I think I must have miscalculated when I thought March 21 was Wednesday. But according to this, day 47 is March 21, which is Wednesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Sunday. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Sunday.\n</think>", "Sunday"], [124, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, December 4, 2022, to Saturday, January 14, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates. Wait, the start date is Sunday, December 4, 2022, and the end date is Saturday, January 14, 2022. Wait, but January 14 is after December 4, so the period is from December 4 to January 14. But wait, the start date is a Sunday, and the end date is a Saturday. So the total days between them include both dates. But I need to count only the business days.\n\nHmm, maybe I should break this down into two parts: December 2022 and January 2022. Let me check the days in each month.\n\nStarting with December 4, 2022. December has 31 days. So from December 4 to December 31, inclusive. Then January 1 to January 14, inclusive.\n\nBut first, let me confirm the days of the week for these dates. Wait, December 4 is a Sunday. Let me check what day of the week January 14 is. Wait, but maybe I can calculate the number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, count each month's business days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates, then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. But since the start and end dates are specific, I need to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days from December 4 to January 14 inclusive. Let's calculate that.\n\nDecember has 31 days. So from December 4 to December 31 is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days. Wait, because inclusive. So December 4 is day 1, December 5 is day 2, ..., December 31 is day 28. Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total days is 28 + 14 = 42 days. Wait, but that would be from December 4 to January 14 inclusive. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. From December 4 to December 31 is 28 days (since 31-4=27 days, plus 1 for inclusive). Then January 1 to 14 is 14 days. So total 28 +14=42 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 42 days.\n\nBut now, how many of those are business days? So business days are Monday-Friday. So weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So I need to subtract the number of Saturdays and Sundays in this period.\n\nBut how to count that? Let's think about the starting date. December 4 is a Sunday. So the first day is Sunday. Then December 5 is Monday, and so on. Let me list the days for December and January.\n\nStarting with December 4 (Sunday). Let's count the days in December:\n\nDecember 4: Sunday\n\nDecember 5: Monday\n\nDecember 6: Tuesday\n\nDecember 7: Wednesday\n\nDecember 8: Thursday\n\nDecember 9: Friday\n\nDecember 10: Saturday\n\nDecember 11: Sunday\n\nDecember 12: Monday\n\nDecember 13: Tuesday\n\nDecember 14: Wednesday\n\nDecember 15: Thursday\n\nDecember 16: Friday\n\nDecember 17: Saturday\n\nDecember 18: Sunday\n\nDecember 19: Monday\n\nDecember 20: Tuesday\n\nDecember 21: Wednesday\n\nDecember 22: Thursday\n\nDecember 23: Friday\n\nDecember 24: Saturday\n\nDecember 25: Sunday\n\nDecember 26: Monday\n\nDecember 27: Tuesday\n\nDecember 28: Wednesday\n\nDecember 29: Thursday\n\nDecember 30: Friday\n\nDecember 31: Saturday\n\nSo from December 4 to December 31, inclusive, how many weekends are there?\n\nLooking at the days:\n\nDecember 4 (Sunday) is the first day. Then the next weekends are:\n\nDecember 10 (Saturday), 11 (Sunday), 17 (Saturday), 18 (Sunday), 24 (Saturday), 25 (Sunday), 31 (Saturday). Wait, December 31 is Saturday. So that's 7 weekends? Let me count:\n\nWeekend days in December:\n\nSaturdays: 10, 17, 24, 31. That's 4 Saturdays.\n\nSundays: 11, 18, 25. That's 3 Sundays. So total 4 + 3 = 7 weekend days in December.\n\nBut wait, December 4 is Sunday, so the first weekend is Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 (Monday) is not a weekend. Wait, no. Wait, the first weekend would be Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 is Monday. Wait, but the first weekend is the first two days? Wait, no. Wait, weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So in December, the first weekend is Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 is Monday. Wait, no. Wait, Dec 4 is Sunday. The previous Saturday would be Dec 3, but that's before the start date. So in the period from Dec 4 to Dec 31, the first weekend is Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 is Monday. Wait, but Dec 4 is a Sunday, so that's a weekend day. Then Dec 5 is Monday, which is a business day. Then Dec 10 is Saturday, Dec 11 is Sunday. Then Dec 17, 18, 24, 25, 31. So in the December period, the weekend days are:\n\nDec 4 (Sunday), Dec 10 (Sat), Dec 11 (Sun), Dec 17 (Sat), Dec 18 (Sun), Dec 24 (Sat), Dec 25 (Sun), Dec 31 (Sat). Wait, that's 8 days? Wait, Dec 4 is Sunday, then Dec 10 (Sat), Dec 11 (Sun), Dec 17 (Sat), Dec 18 (Sun), Dec 24 (Sat), Dec 25 (Sun), Dec 31 (Sat). That's 8 weekend days. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 Saturdays and 3 Sundays. Let me count again:\n\nSaturdays in Dec 4-31: Dec 10, 17, 24, 31. That's 4 Saturdays.\n\nSundays: Dec 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 4 Sundays. Wait, that's 4 + 4 = 8. So that's 8 weekend days in December. So that's correct. So in December, from Dec 4 to Dec 31, there are 8 weekend days. So the total days in December is 28 days (from Dec 4 to Dec 31 inclusive). So business days in December would be 28 - 8 = 20 days.\n\nThen, moving to January 1 to January 14. Let's check the days in January. January 1, 2022 is a Saturday? Wait, wait, December 31, 2022 is a Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is a Sunday. Wait, because December 31 is Saturday, so the next day is Sunday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, let me check. Wait, if Dec 4 is Sunday, then Dec 5 is Monday, and so on. Let me check Dec 31. Let me count the days from Dec 4 to Dec 31. Dec 4 is Sunday. Then Dec 5 is Monday, Dec 6 Tuesday, Dec 7 Wednesday, Dec 8 Thursday, Dec 9 Friday, Dec 10 Saturday, Dec 11 Sunday, Dec 12 Monday, Dec 13 Tuesday, Dec 14 Wednesday, Dec 15 Thursday, Dec 16 Friday, Dec 17 Saturday, Dec 18 Sunday, Dec 19 Monday, Dec 20 Tuesday, Dec 21 Wednesday, Dec 22 Thursday, Dec 23 Friday, Dec 24 Saturday, Dec 25 Sunday, Dec 26 Monday, Dec 27 Tuesday, Dec 28 Wednesday, Dec 29 Thursday, Dec 30 Friday, Dec 31 Saturday. So yes, Dec 31 is Saturday. Therefore, January 1 is Sunday. So January 1 is Sunday, January 2 is Monday, January 3 is Tuesday, January 4 is Wednesday, January 5 is Thursday, January 6 is Friday, January 7 is Saturday, January 8 is Sunday, and so on. So the period from January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. Let's count the weekend days in that period.\n\nJanuary 1 (Sunday), 2 (Monday), 3 (Tuesday), 4 (Wednesday), 5 (Thursday), 6 (Friday), 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday), 9 (Monday), 10 (Tuesday), 11 (Wednesday), 12 (Thursday), 13 (Friday), 14 (Saturday). So the weekend days in January 1-14 are:\n\nJanuary 1 (Sunday), 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday), 14 (Saturday). That's 4 weekend days. Wait, let me check again:\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday (weekend)\n\nJanuary 7: Saturday (weekend)\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday (weekend)\n\nJanuary 14: Saturday (weekend). So that's 4 weekend days. So the total days in January 1-14 is 14 days. So business days would be 14 - 4 = 10 days.\n\nSo total business days from Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive would be December's 20 business days plus January's 10 business days, totaling 30 days. Wait, but wait, let me check again. Wait, December has 28 days total, 8 weekends, so 20 business days. January has 14 days, 4 weekends, so 10 business days. 20 + 10 = 30. But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the total days (42) minus the number of weekends (8 + 4 = 12) gives 42 - 12 = 30. So that's the same answer. So that would be 30 business days. But wait, let me check again. Because the total days from Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive is 42 days. If there are 12 weekend days, then 42 - 12 = 30 business days. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the dates again. Because sometimes when you count days, you might have an off-by-one error. Let me check the total days again. From Dec 4 to Dec 31: 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days. Then Jan 1 to Jan 14 is 14 days. 28 +14=42. Correct. So total days is 42. Then weekends are 8 in December and 4 in January, total 12. So 42-12=30. So the answer is 30?\n\nBut wait, let me check the individual months again. For December, the business days are 20. Let me count them. From Dec 4 (Sunday) to Dec 31 (Saturday). So the business days would be Monday to Friday. Let's count the days:\n\nDec 4 is Sunday (weekend), so the first business day is Dec 5 (Monday). Then Dec 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri) \u2013 that's 5 days. Then Dec 10 is Sat (weekend), Dec 11 Sun (weekend). Then Dec 12 Mon, 13 Tue, 14 Wed, 15 Thu, 16 Fri \u2013 5 days. Then Dec 17 Sat (weekend), 18 Sun (weekend). Dec 19 Mon, 20 Tue, 21 Wed, 22 Thu, 23 Fri \u2013 5 days. Dec 24 Sat (weekend), 25 Sun (weekend). Dec 26 Mon, 27 Tue, 28 Wed, 29 Thu, 30 Fri \u2013 5 days. Dec 31 is Sat (weekend). So that's 5+5+5+5=20 days. Yes, that's correct. So 20 business days in December.\n\nIn January, from Jan 1 (Sunday) to Jan 14 (Saturday). The business days are Jan 2 (Mon) to Jan 6 (Fri) \u2013 5 days. Then Jan 7 (Sat) is weekend, Jan 8 (Sun) weekend. Then Jan 9 (Mon) to Jan 13 (Fri) \u2013 5 days. Then Jan 14 (Sat) is weekend. So that's 5 +5 = 10 days. So 10 business days in January. 20 +10=30. So the answer is 30.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"inclusive of both dates\". So Dec 4 is included and Jan 14 is included. So in the December part, Dec 4 is Sunday, which is a weekend day. So that's counted as a weekend day. But in the calculation above, we subtracted the weekends. So the business days are 20, which includes Dec 5 to Dec 31, except weekends. But Dec 4 is a weekend day, so it's excluded. So the total business days from Dec 4 to Dec 31 is 20. Then in January, Jan 1 is a weekend day (Sunday), so it's excluded. So the business days in January are from Jan 2 to Jan 14, which is 10 days. So total 20 +10=30. So the answer is 30.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between Dec 4 and Jan 14 inclusive.\n\nStarting with Dec 4 (Sunday). So the first business day is Dec 5 (Monday). Let's count each business day.\n\nDec 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nDec 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nDec 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nDec 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nThen in January:\n\nJan 2 (Mon), 3 (Tue), 4 (Wed), 5 (Thu), 6 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nJan 9 (Mon), 10 (Tue), 11 (Wed), 12 (Thu), 13 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nSo that's 5+5+5+5+5+5=30 days. Yes, that's 30 business days. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 30.\n</think>", "30"], [124, "On which weekday did June 26, 2022 fall?

Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because I remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days, so 2021 started on a Wednesday plus 366 days. Wait, 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So if 2020 started on Wednesday, then 2021 would start on Wednesday + 2 days, which is Friday. Wait, but I think I might be getting confused here. Maybe I should look up a calendar or use another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about some known events.

Wait, June has 30 days, so June 26 plus 4 days is July 1. Then July 1 is a Monday? Wait, if July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 would be a Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let me think. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 25 days to June 1 would get me to June 26. Let me check. 25 days later. Since 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So if June 1 is a Wednesday, then adding 3 weeks (21 days) would still be Wednesday. Then adding 4 more days would be Sunday. So June 26 would be a Sunday? But wait, I'm not sure if June 1 was a Wednesday. Maybe I need to verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me think again. Let me check the actual calendar. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can calculate it. Let's see. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if 2021 started on Friday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make 2022 start on Saturday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, let's check February 1, 2022. January has 31 days, so 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 would be Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. Then March 1 would be 28 days later (since 2022 is not a leap year). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 is Friday + 2 days = Sunday. Then June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So June 1 would be Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. So that matches my previous thought. So June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Then June 26 is 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So adding 3 weeks (21 days) brings us to June 25, which is also a Wednesday. Then adding 4 days: Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday. So June 26 would be a Sunday. Therefore, the answer should be Sunday. But wait, I need to make sure that my calculation of June 1 being a Wednesday is correct. Let me check again. January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. March 1 is Tuesday. April 1 is Friday. May 1 is Sunday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. Yes, that seems correct. So June 26 is 25 days after June 1. 25 days is 3 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday is Sunday. Therefore, June 26, 2022 was a Sunday.\n</think>", "Sunday"], [124, "Name the day of the week for 06/29/2022. Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 29, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because January 1, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2022 would be one year later. Since 2021 is not a leap year, 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Wait, July 4, 2022. Let me check. If I can remember that July 4, 2021 was a Monday, then adding 365 days would be 52 weeks and 1 day, so July 4, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another date. For example, I know that June 29, 2022 is the date in question. Let me think about the days around that time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 29, 2022 is a Wednesday. Wait, but how do I confirm that? Maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to calculate it manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me think again. Let me check the days for 2021. January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Wait, no, I think I need to get this right. Let me try to recall. Wait, I think that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 was a leap year, so 366 days. So 2020 started on Wednesday, so 2021 would start on Wednesday + 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be a Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if 2021 started on Friday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make 2022 start on Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Then, if I can count the days from January 1, 2022 to June 29, 2022, I can find the day of the week.\n\nSo let's do that. Let's count the number of days from January 1 to June 29, 2022. Let's break it down month by month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 2022 has 28 days (since 2022 is not a leap year). March has 31 days, April 30, May 31, and June 29. So adding those up:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (from Jan 1 to Jan 31)\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 29 (but we need to count up to June 29, so that's 29 days in June, but since we're starting from Jan 1, the total days from Jan 1 to June 29 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 29. Wait, but wait, if we start on Jan 1, then the total days from Jan 1 to June 29 is the sum of the days in each month up to June 29. Wait, but if we are counting from Jan 1 to June 29 inclusive, then that's correct. But since we need to find the number of days between Jan 1 and June 29, inclusive, but since we need to find the day of the week, we can calculate the total days and then take modulo 7.\n\nWait, but if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 31 days (Jan 1 to Jan 31) would be 31 days. Then adding February 28 days, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 29. Let me add them up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 29 (June) = 180 days.\n\nWait, but that's the total number of days from January 1 to June 29, inclusive. But since we want to know how many days after January 1, June 29 is, we need to subtract 1 day if we're counting from Jan 1 to June 29 inclusive. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, etc. So the total number of days between January 1 and June 29 is 180 days. Wait, but if I add up all the days in each month up to June 29, that's 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 29 = 180. So that's correct. So June 29 is 180 days after January 1, 2022.\n\nNow, since January 1 is a Saturday, adding 180 days. Let's compute 180 divided by 7. 7*25=175, so 180-175=5. So 5 days after Saturday. Saturday + 5 days is Thursday? Wait, Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday, +5 is Thursday. So that would mean June 29 is a Thursday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of days.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me recount the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so 31 + 28 = 59. March has 31, so 59 + 31 = 90. April has 30, so 90 + 30 = 120. May has 31, so 120 + 31 = 151. June has 29 days, so 151 + 29 = 180. So that's correct. So 180 days from January 1. So 180 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 5 days. So 25 weeks is 175 days, so 180 - 175 = 5 days. So adding 5 days to Saturday. Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. So June 29, 2022 would be a Thursday?\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the starting day. Because if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Let me check that again. Because if 2021 started on Friday (January 1, 2021 was a Friday), then 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Then adding 180 days would be 25 weeks and 5 days. So Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. So June 29, 2022 is a Thursday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I can check another way. Let me check a known date. For example, July 4, 2022. If June 29 is Thursday, then July 4 would be 5 days later. So July 4 would be Tuesday. But I think I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, that's conflicting. So if July 4 is a Monday, then June 29 would be 5 days before that, which would be a Saturday. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So there's a mistake here. Therefore, my initial assumption about the starting day must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between January 1 and June 29. Let me check again. Let me count the days step by step. January 1 is day 1. Then January has 31 days, so January 31 is day 31. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is day 31 + 28 = 59. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 59 + 31 = 90. April has 30 days, so April 30 is day 90 + 30 = 120. May has 31 days, so May 31 is day 120 + 31 = 151. Then June 29 is day 151 + 29 = 180. So that's correct. So 180 days from January 1. So if January 1 is Saturday, then 180 days later is Thursday. But if July 4 is Monday, then June 29 would be Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 being a Saturday must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I got the starting day wrong. Let me check another way. Let me check what day of the week July 4, 2022 was. If I can find that, then I can work backward. Alternatively, I can use another known date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then July 4 would be Monday. Because July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. So that's correct. So July 4, 2022 is a Monday. Then, if June 29 is 5 days before July 4, that would be June 29 is a Saturday. So that would mean that my previous calculation was wrong. Therefore, my mistake must be in the starting day of January 1, 2022.\n\nSo if June 29 is a Saturday, then the number of days from January 1 to June 29 is 180 days. So 180 days later is Saturday. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 180 days would be Saturday again. But that would mean that 180 days is a multiple of 7. But 180 divided by 7 is 25*7=175, 180-175=5. So 5 days later. So that would mean that if January 1 is Saturday, then June 29 is Saturday + 5 days = Thursday. But that contradicts the July 4 being Monday. Therefore, there's a mistake in my calculation of the starting day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe January 1, 2022 is not a Saturday. Let me check again. Let me think about 2021. If January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then 2021 has 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. But if that's correct, then July 4, 2022 is Monday, which would mean that June 29 is Saturday. But according to the calculation, June 29 is Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my mistake must be in the calculation of the days between January 1 and June 29. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm counting the days wrong. Let me count the days from January 1 to June 29, 2022. Let's do it step by step:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90. April has 30 days, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120. May has 31 days, so up to May 31 is 120 + 31 = 151. Then June 29 is 29 days into June. So total days from January 1 to June 29 is 151 + 29 = 180. That's correct. So 180 days. So if January 1 is Saturday, then 180 days later is Thursday. But according to the July 4 being Monday, June 29 should be Saturday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I got the day of the week for January 1, 2021 wrong. Let me check that. I think that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 was a leap year, so 366 days. So 2020 started on Wednesday, so 2021 would start on Wednesday + 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So 2021 would start on Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. So January 1, 2021 is Friday. Then 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. But then June 29 is Thursday, but July 4 is Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation of the days between January 1 and June 29. Wait, maybe I'm counting the days wrong. Let me check the number of days between January 1 and June 29 again. Let me count the days in each month:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (from Jan 1 to Jan 31)\nFebruary: 28 days (Feb 1 to Feb 28)\nMarch: 31 days (Mar 1 to Mar 31)\nApril: 30 days (Apr 1 to Apr 30)\nMay: 31 days (May 1 to May 31)\nJune: 29 days (June 1 to June 29)\n\nSo total days from Jan 1 to June 29 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 29 = 180. That's correct. So 180 days. So if January 1 is Saturday, then 180 days later is Thursday. But according to July 4 being Monday, June 29 should be Saturday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, my mistake must be in the assumption that January 1, 2022 is Saturday. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the day of the week for July 4. Let me check that. If July 4, 2022 is a Monday, then June 29 is 5 days before that. So June 29 would be Saturday. But if June 29 is Saturday, then the number of days from January 1 to June 29 is 180 days. So 180 days from Saturday is 180 mod 7 = 5 days. So Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. But that's conflicting. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm counting the days from January 1 to June 29 as 180 days, but if January 1 is Saturday, then June 29 is 180 days later. But if July 4 is Monday, then June 29 is 5 days before July 4, which is Saturday. So that would mean that 180 days from Saturday is Saturday. But 180 mod 7 is 5, so Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake"], [124, "What day of the week was May 31, 2022?

Let's say I take a date I know. For example, if I know that May 1, 2022 was a Monday, then May 31 would be 30 days later. Wait, but that's not correct because May has 31 days, so May 1 is the first day. Wait, if May 1 is a certain day, then May 31 would be 30 days later. But how do I find out what day May 1 was?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me think. If I can confirm that, then I can count the days from January 1 to May 31.\n\nSo, January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, and May 31. Wait, but if I'm going from January 1 to May 31, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) days? Wait, no. Wait, if I'm starting from January 1, then to get to May 31, I need to add the days of each month up to April, and then add 31 days for May. Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is day 1. Then, the number of days from January 1 to May 31 is (31 - 1) + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should calculate the total days from January 1 to May 31.

Wait, but that's 31 days later. Since 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So if January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday.

Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, and so on. So January 7 is Friday, January 8 is Saturday. Then January 15 is Saturday, 22, 29. Then January 29 is Saturday, 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday. So yes, January 31, 2022 was a Monday. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on. So February 1, 2022 would be Tuesday. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days later. 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks, so February 28 would be a Tuesday as well. Then March 1, 2022 is Wednesday. March has 31 days. So March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 8, 15, 22, 29 are Wednesdays. Then March 30 is Thursday, March 31 is Friday. So March 31 is Friday.\n\nThen April 1 is Saturday. April has 30 days. So April 1 is Saturday. Then April 8, 15, 22, 29 are Saturdays. Then April 30 is a Sunday. So April 30 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. Wait, so May 1 is Monday. Then May 31 is 30 days later. Wait, May has 31 days, so May 1 is day 1, May 31 is day 31. So from May 1 to May 31 is 30 days later. Wait, but 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if May 1 is Monday, then adding 30 days would be 4 weeks (28 days) plus 2 days. So Monday + 2 days is Wednesday. Therefore, May 31 would be a Wednesday? Wait, but that seems conflicting with some other information I might have. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way.

Where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check again. Let's start from January 1, 2022 as Saturday. Then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 31 is Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is Tuesday. March 1 is Wednesday. March has 31 days. March 1 is Wednesday. March 28 is Wednesday. March 29 is Thursday, March 30 is Friday, March 31 is Saturday.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous step. Let me recount.\n\nIf March 1 is Wednesday, then March 1 + 7 days is March 8 (Wednesday). March 15 (Wednesday), March 22 (Wednesday), March 29 (Wednesday). Then March 30 is Thursday, March 31 is Friday. So March 31 is Friday. Then April 1 is Saturday. April has 30 days. So April 1 is Saturday. Then April 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then April 30 is Sunday. So April 30 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. Then May 1 is Monday. Then May 8 is Monday, 15, 22, 29. Then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. Wait, that's different. So May 31 would be Tuesday. So where did I go wrong in the previous calculation?\n\nEarlier, I thought that May 1 is Monday, and adding 30 days would be 4 weeks and 2 days, so Monday + 2 days is Wednesday. But that's wrong. Because May 1 is Monday, then May 8 is Monday (7 days later), May 15 is Monday, May 22 is Monday, May 29 is Monday. Then May 30 is Tuesday, May 31 is Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the other calculation. Wait, but according to the step-by-step, May 31 is Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. Let me check again. If May 1 is Monday, then May 1 is Monday. Then May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 is Wednesday, ..., May 7 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Monday. So May 8 is Monday. Then May 15 is Monday, 22, 29. Then May 29 is Monday. Then May 30 is Tuesday, May 31 is Wednesday. So according to this, May 31 is Wednesday. But according to the previous step-by-step, when I counted March 31 as Friday, April 30 as Sunday, then May 1 is Monday, and then May 31 is Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the step where I said April 30 is Sunday. Let me check that again. If April 1 is Saturday, then April 1 is Saturday. April 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then April 29 is Saturday. April 30 is Sunday. So that's correct. Then May 1 is Monday. Then May 1 is Monday. Then May 31 is 30 days later. Wait, but if May 1 is Monday, then May 31 is 30 days later. Let's count the days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Monday would be Wednesday. But according to the step-by-step, May 31 is Wednesday. But earlier, when I thought that May 31 is Tuesday, that was a mistake. Wait, but why did I think that? Because I thought that May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. But that's not correct. Wait, if May 29 is Monday, then May 30 is Tuesday, May 31 is Wednesday. So that's correct. So why did I think earlier that May 31 is Tuesday? That was a mistake. So the correct answer is Wednesday?\n\nBut I need to check this again. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check an online calendar or use another approach. Wait, since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 31, 2022 is a certain day. Wait, I think I remember that May 31, 2022 was a Tuesday. But according to my calculations, it's Wednesday. Which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the step where I calculated March 31. Let me check again. March 1 is Wednesday. March 8 is Wednesday. March 15 is Wednesday. March 22 is Wednesday. March 29 is Wednesday. Then March 30 is Thursday, March 31 is Friday. So that's correct. Then April 1 is Saturday. April 1 is Saturday. Then April 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. April 29 is Saturday. April 30 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. Then May 1 is Monday. Then May 8 is Monday. May 15 is Monday. May 22 is Monday. May 29 is Monday. Then May 30 is Tuesday, May 31 is Wednesday. So according to this, May 31 is Wednesday. But I thought earlier that May 31 was Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for another date. For example, I know that May 29, 2022 was a Monday. Then May 30 is Tuesday, May 31 is Wednesday. So that's correct. Therefore, May 31, 2022 is Wednesday. But I thought earlier that it was Tuesday. So where did I go wrong in that previous thought? Maybe I confused the dates. So the correct answer is Wednesday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's use Zeller's Congruence. The formula for Zeller's Congruence for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, we need to adjust the month and year accordingly.\n\nSo for May 31, 2022, the month is May, which is m = 5. The year is 2022. So q = 31, m = 5, K = 22, J = 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (31 + floor((13*(5 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nfloor((13*(6))/5) = floor(78/5) = floor(15.6) = 15\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n31 + 15 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 31 + 15 is 46, plus 22 is 68, plus 5 is 73, plus 5 is 78, plus 100 is 178.\n\nNow, 178 mod 7. Let's divide 178 by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 178 - 175 = 3. So h = 3.\n\nAccording to Zeller's Congruence, h = 3 corresponds to Monday (since 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, 3 = Tuesday, 4 = Wednesday, 5 = Thursday, 6 = Friday). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula says h is 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, 3 = Tuesday, 4 = Wednesday, 5 = Thursday, 6 = Friday. So h=3 is Tuesday. But according to my previous calculation, May 31 is Wednesday. But according to Zeller's Congruence, it's Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula is h = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7.\n\nWait, for May 31, 2022, m is 5, q is 31, K is 22, J is 20.\n\nSo:\n\nfloor((13*(5+1))/5) = floor(78/5) = 15. Correct.\n\nThen K is 22, floor(K/4) is floor(22/4) = 5. Correct.\n\nfloor(J/4) is floor(20/4) = 5. Correct.\n\n5J is 5*20 = 100. Correct.\n\nSo total is 31 + 15 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 178. 178 divided by 7 is 25*7=175, remainder 3. So h=3. Which is Tuesday. But according to my previous step-by-step, it was Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's formula. Let me check the formula again. Wait, the formula is for the Gregorian calendar. But maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me check again.\n\nZeller's Congruence formula for Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nBut the h is 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, 3 = Tuesday, 4 = Wednesday, 5 = Thursday, 6 = Friday.\n\nSo if h=3, that's Tuesday. But according to my previous step-by-step, May 31 is Wednesday. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the step-by-step. Let me check again.\n\nIf May 1 is Monday, then May 8 is Monday, May 15 is Monday, May 22 is Monday, May 29 is Monday. Then May 30 is Tuesday, May 31 is Wednesday. So that's Wednesday. But according to Zeller's formula, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's calculation. Let me check again. Maybe I messed up the month and year. Wait, for Zeller's Congruence, if the"], [124, "Count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022 - what's the weekday? Reply with just the weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week it was 81 days before Tuesday, October 4, 2022. Let me start by understanding the problem. The question is asking to count backward 81 days from that date and find the corresponding weekday.\n\nFirst, I should confirm the starting date: Tuesday, October 4, 2022. Let me check if that's correct. October 4, 2022, was indeed a Tuesday. So that's the starting point.\n\nNow, I need to subtract 81 days from this date. But how do I do that? Well, maybe I can break down the 81 days into weeks and remaining days because weeks cycle every 7 days. Since 7 days make a week, subtracting 7 days multiple times would help. Let me calculate how many weeks are in 81 days. 81 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder. Let me do the math: 7*11=77, so 81-77=4. So 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. Therefore, subtracting 81 days is the same as subtracting 11 weeks and 4 days. Since subtracting 11 weeks would bring me back to the same day of the week, the remaining 4 days would determine the weekday.\n\nSo if I subtract 11 weeks from Tuesday, October 4, 2022, that would still be Tuesday. Then I need to subtract 4 more days. Let me count backward 4 days from Tuesday. \n\nStarting from Tuesday, subtracting one day is Monday, then Sunday, then Saturday, then Friday. Wait, that's four days. So subtracting 4 days from Tuesday would land on Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But wait, let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with dates, especially across month boundaries or different months, the actual day might not be straightforward. Maybe I should check the actual dates to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me try to calculate the date 81 days before October 4, 2022. Let's start by subtracting 81 days step by step. But that might take a while. Alternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let me think.\n\nOctober has 31 days. So October 4 minus 81 days. Let me subtract days step by step. Let's start by subtracting 31 days from October 4, which would take me to September 4, 2022. Then subtract another 31 days to get August 4, 2022. Then subtract another 31 days to get July 4, 2022. Wait, but 31+31+31 is 93 days, which is more than 81. So that approach might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can subtract 81 days by breaking it into months. Let's see. October 4 minus 81 days. Let's subtract 7 days each week. But maybe it's easier to use a calendar. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. So if I subtract 11 weeks (77 days) from October 4, 2022, that would be October 4 minus 77 days. Let me calculate that. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 7 days is September 27. Then subtract another 7 days: September 20. Then another 7: September 13. Then another 7: September 6. Then another 7: August 29. Then another 7: August 22. Then another 7: August 15. Then another 7: August 8. Then another 7: August 1. Then another 7: July 25. Wait, that's 11 weeks. Wait, 7*11 is 77 days. So October 4 minus 77 days would be July 25, 2022. Then subtract 4 more days to get to July 21, 2022. Wait, but that's 77 + 4 = 81 days. So July 25 minus 4 days is July 21. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check. Wait, if I subtract 77 days from October 4, 2022, that would be July 25, 2022. Then subtract 4 more days: July 25 minus 1 day is July 24, minus 2 is July 23, minus 3 is July 22, minus 4 is July 21. So July 21, 2022. Now, I need to check what day of the week that was. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for July 21, 2022. Since I know that October 4, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check if I can find the day of the week for July 21, 2022. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days and calculate the number of days between the two dates. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can use the fact that if I subtract 4 days from Tuesday, that would be Friday. Wait, but earlier I thought that subtracting 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday. But if the actual date is July 21, 2022, then what day was that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check an online calendar or use a known reference. Wait, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Let me confirm. If July 1 is Friday, then July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday, July 5 is Tuesday, July 6 is Wednesday, July 7 is Thursday, July 8 is Friday. So July 1 is Friday. Then July 21 would be 20 days later. Let me count. From July 1 to July 21 is 20 days. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Friday: Friday + 6 days is Thursday (Friday + 1 is Saturday, +2 Sunday, +3 Monday, +4 Tuesday, +5 Wednesday, +6 Thursday). So July 21, 2022, would be a Thursday. Wait, but according to my previous calculation, subtracting 81 days from October 4, 2022, would be July 21, 2022. But according to this, July 21 is a Thursday. But earlier, I thought that subtracting 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday. But that contradicts. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh, here's the problem. My initial assumption that subtracting 11 weeks (77 days) and then 4 days would result in subtracting 4 days from Tuesday. But if the actual date is July 21, which is a Thursday, then that would mean that my initial calculation was wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe my calculation of subtracting 77 days from October 4 is incorrect. Let me check again. October 4 minus 77 days. Let's do it step by step. October has 31 days. So October 4 minus 7 days is September 27. Then minus another 7 days is September 20. Then September 13, September 6, August 29, August 22, August 15, August 8, August 1, July 25. Wait, that's 11 weeks (77 days). So October 4 minus 77 days is July 25, 2022. Then subtract 4 more days: July 25 minus 4 days is July 21. So July 21 is the date. But according to my previous calculation, July 21 is a Thursday. But if October 4 is a Tuesday, then subtracting 4 days would be Friday. But that's conflicting. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, because the initial assumption that subtracting 11 weeks (77 days) would leave the same day of the week is correct. So if October 4 is Tuesday, then July 25 is also Tuesday. Then subtracting 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday. But according to the other calculation, July 21 is Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the steps is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that July 1, 2022, is a Friday is incorrect. Let me check that again. Let me think. I know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think that's correct. So January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then, let's count the days for July 1. Let's see. From January 1 to July 1 is 181 days. Wait, January has 31 days, February 28 (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 1. So total days from January 1 to July 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181. So 181 days. Now, 181 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 6 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Adding 181 days would be Saturday + 6 days = Friday. So July 1, 2022, is a Friday. That seems correct. Then July 21 is 20 days after July 1. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Friday + 6 days is Thursday. Therefore, July 21 is a Thursday. But according to the other method, subtracting 4 days from Tuesday (October 4) would be Friday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, here's the problem. If July 25 is Tuesday (since October 4 is Tuesday, and 77 days before is July 25), then July 25 is Tuesday. Then July 25 minus 4 days is July 21, which would be Tuesday minus 4 days. Let's count that. Tuesday minus 1 day is Monday, minus 2 is Sunday, minus 3 is Saturday, minus 4 is Friday. So July 21 should be Friday. But according to the other calculation, July 21 is Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the steps is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe my calculation of the date is wrong. Let me check again. October 4 minus 77 days. Let me count the days step by step. Let's start from October 4, 2022. Subtract 7 days: September 27. Subtract another 7: September 20. Subtract another 7: September 13. Subtract another 7: September 6. Subtract another 7: August 29. Subtract another 7: August 22. Subtract another 7: August 15. Subtract another 7: August 8. Subtract another 7: August 1. Subtract another 7: July 25. That's 11 weeks (77 days). So July 25 is correct. So July 25 is Tuesday. Then July 25 minus 4 days is July 21. So July 21 is Tuesday minus 4 days. Let's count: Tuesday (July 25) minus 1 day is Monday (July 24), minus 2 is Sunday (July 23), minus 3 is Saturday (July 22), minus 4 is Friday (July 21). So July 21 should be Friday. But earlier calculation said it's Thursday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe my calculation of July 1 being Friday is wrong. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022, is a Saturday, then adding 181 days (as calculated) would be 181 days later. Let me check 181 divided by 7. 7*25=175, so 181-175=6. So 25 weeks and 6 days. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. So July 1 is Friday. Then July 21 is 20 days later. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Friday + 6 days is Thursday. But according to the other method, July 21 is Friday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between July 1 and July 21. Let me count. July 1 is Friday. July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday, July 5 is Tuesday, July 6 is Wednesday, July 7 is Thursday, July 8 is Friday. So every 7 days, it cycles. So July 1 is Friday, July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday. Therefore, July 21 is Thursday. So that's correct. Therefore, July 21 is Thursday. But according to the other method, it's Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nWait, but if July 25 is Tuesday, then July 25 is Tuesday. July 25 minus 4 days is July 21. So July 21 is Tuesday minus 4 days. Let's count again. Tuesday minus 1 day is Monday (July 24), minus 2 is Sunday (July 23), minus 3 is Saturday (July 22), minus 4 is Friday (July 21). But according to the other calculation, July 21 is Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is confusing. There must be an error in one of the calculations. Let me check the date of July 25, 2022. If July 1 is Friday, then July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. So July 25 is two days before July 27 (which is Sunday). Wait, July 25 is two days before July 27. So July 25 is Friday minus 2 days, which is Wednesday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, July 22 is Friday. July 23 is Saturday, July 24 is Sunday, July 25 is Monday. Wait, that's conflicting with previous statements. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then July 22 is Friday. Then July 23 is Saturday, July 24 is Sunday, July 25 is Monday. So July 25 is Monday. But earlier I thought that July 25 is Tuesday. So that's the mistake. Where did I get that July 25 is Tuesday from? Because I thought that October 4 is Tuesday, and subtracting 77 days would bring me to July 25. But if July 25 is Monday, then October 4 would be Monday plus 77 days. Let me check that. If July 25 is Monday, then adding 77 days would be October 4. Let me check that. July has 31 days, so July 25 to July 31 is 6 days. August has 31 days, so August 25 to August 31 is 6 days. September has 30 days. So from July 25 to September 25 is 6 + 31 + 6 = 43 days. Then October 4 is 9 days after September 25. So total days from July 25 to October 4 is 43 + 9 = 52 days. Wait, but that's only 52 days. But I thought that 77 days. So clearly, there's a mistake here. Therefore, my previous calculation of subtracting 77 days from October 4 to get July 25 is wrong. So where is the error?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the subtraction of 77 days. Let me try again. October 4 minus 77 days. Let's do it step by step. October has 31 days. So October 4 minus 7 days is September 27. Then minus another 7 days is September 20. Then September 13, September 6, August 29, August 22, August 15, August 8, August 1, July 25. Wait, that's 11 weeks (77 days). But according to the other calculation, July 25 is Monday. So if October 4 is Tuesday, then July 25 should be Tuesday minus 77 days. But if July 25 is Monday, then October 4 is Monday plus 77 days. Let me check the number of days between July 25 and October 4. July 25 to July 31 is 6 days. August has 31 days, so August 25 to August 31 is 6 days. September has 30 days, so September 25 to September 30 is 5 days. Then October 1 to October 4 is 4 days. So total days from July 25 to October 4 is 6 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 21 days. Wait, that's only 21 days. But that's not"], [124, "If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? I need to figure out the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the first day of the year is Saturday. So January 1st is a Saturday. Now, I need to find out what day of the week March 25th is. To do this, I should calculate the number of days between January 1st and March 25th, then find the remainder when divided by 7, since the days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n\nLet me break it down. January has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. But since the first day of the year is Saturday, maybe we can assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed to not require knowing if it's a leap year? Wait, but March 25th is in the same year, so if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. Maybe I should check if the year is a leap year based on the given information. Wait, but how? The first day of the year is Saturday. If it's a leap year, then February has 29 days. But without knowing the year, maybe the problem is assuming a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, the number of days would be different. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year. Wait, but maybe the problem is in a specific context where the year is not a leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to not require knowing that. Wait, but how can I proceed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check. For example, if the first day of the year is Saturday, then if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check both possibilities? But that seems complicated. Wait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me think. Let's assume that it's a non-leap year. So February has 28 days. Then, the total days from January 1st to March 25th would be 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 25 (March) days? Wait, no. Wait, March 25th is the 25th day of March. So the total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 25 (March) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 25 is 84 days. Wait, but wait, January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 25 is 25 days into March, so total days from January 1 to March 25 is 59 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but that's 84 days. But if the first day is Saturday, then 84 days later would be the same day of the week because 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 days later would be Saturday again. But that would mean March 25 is a Saturday? But that seems too easy. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is also Saturday, and so on. So each week is 7 days. So 7 days later is same day. So 84 days is 12 weeks. So 84 days later would be same day. So March 25 would be Saturday? But that seems possible. But wait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. So adding that, 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 25 is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 25 is 59 + 25 = 84 days. So 84 days later. Since 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 12 weeks. So same day. So March 25 would be Saturday. But that seems correct? But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, but if the first day is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, etc. So if I count 84 days later, that's 12 weeks, so same day. So March 25 would be Saturday. But wait, maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's check the actual dates.\n\nFor example, let's take a non-leap year. Let's say 2023. Wait, but 2023's first day is Sunday. But in this problem, the first day is Saturday. So maybe 2024? Wait, 2024 is a leap year. Let me check. Wait, but maybe I should not rely on real years. Let me think. Let's take a hypothetical year where January 1 is Saturday. Let's count the days.\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday.\n\nJanuary 8: Saturday (7 days later).\n\nJanuary 15: Saturday.\n\nJanuary 22: Saturday.\n\nJanuary 29: Saturday.\n\nThen February 5: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 12: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 19: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 26: Saturday.\n\nMarch 5: Saturday.\n\nMarch 12: Saturday.\n\nMarch 19: Saturday.\n\nMarch 26: Saturday.\n\nSo March 25 is one day before March 26. So March 25 would be Friday. Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, what's going on here? Because according to this, March 25 is Friday. But according to the previous calculation, 84 days later would be Saturday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to March 25. Let's do it step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year). So adding 28 days, that's 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 25 is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 25 is 59 + 25 = 84 days. But if I count the days step by step, as in the example above, March 25 is 5 days before March 26, which is Saturday. So March 25 is Friday. But according to the 84 days calculation, it should be Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when I count the days from January 1 to March 25, I need to consider that January 1 is day 1. So if I have 84 days, then day 84 is March 25. But if January 1 is day 1, then day 84 would be 83 days after January 1. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the number of days. Let me think again. If January 1 is day 1, then January 2 is day 2, and so on. So the number of days between January 1 and March 25 is 84 days. But if I want to find the day of the week, I need to calculate (day of the year - 1) mod 7. Because January 1 is day 1, which is Saturday. So day 1: Saturday. Then day 2: Sunday, etc. So day 84 would be (84 - 1) mod 7 = 83 mod 7. Let's calculate 83 divided by 7. 7*11=77, 83-77=6. So 6 mod 7 is 6. So Saturday is 0, Sunday is 1, Monday 2, Tuesday 3, Wednesday 4, Thursday 5, Friday 6. Wait, but if day 1 is Saturday, then day 1 is 0. Then day 2 is 1 (Sunday), day 3 is 2 (Monday), etc. So day 84 would be (84 - 1) = 83 days after day 1. So 83 mod 7 is 6. So that would be Friday. Which matches the step-by-step count. So that's the correct answer. So my initial calculation was wrong because I thought 84 days later would be same day, but that's not correct. Because if day 1 is Saturday, then day 84 is 83 days later. So 83 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. So March 25 is Friday. Therefore, the correct answer is Friday.\n\nBut why did I think earlier that 84 days later would be same day? Because I thought that 84 days is 12 weeks, but that's 84 days after day 1. Wait, no. If day 1 is Saturday, then day 1 + 7 days is day 8, which is Saturday again. So day 8 is Saturday. So day 8 is 7 days after day 1. So day 8 is Saturday. So day 1 + 7 days is day 8. So day 1 + 84 days is day 85. So day 85 would be Saturday. But March 25 is day 84. So day 84 is 83 days after day 1. So that's 11 weeks and 6 days. So 11 weeks is 77 days, 83-77=6 days. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. Therefore, March 25 is Friday. So the correct answer is Friday.\n\nBut why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought that 84 days later would be same day, but that's not correct. Because if you start on day 1 (Saturday), then day 84 is 83 days later, not 84 days later. So the confusion is between the number of days between the two dates versus the number of days after the first day. So the correct way is to calculate the total number of days from January 1 to March 25, which is 84 days. But since January 1 is day 1, then the number of days after January 1 is 83. So 83 days after Saturday is Friday. Therefore, the answer is Friday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check with another approach. Let's count the days step by step. Let's take January 1 as Saturday. Then:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\n\nJanuary 8: Saturday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Saturday\n\nJanuary 22: Saturday\n\nJanuary 29: Saturday\n\nFebruary 5: Saturday (29 + 7 = 36, but wait, January has 31 days. So January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is 6 days later (January 29 + 6 days is February 5). Wait, no. Wait, January 29 is Saturday. Then January 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. So February 5 is 4 days after February 1, which is Tuesday + 4 days = Saturday. So February 5 is Saturday. Then February 12 is Saturday, 19, 26. Then March 5 is Saturday. Then March 12, 19, 26. So March 26 is Saturday. Therefore, March 25 is Friday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Friday.\n\nSo the initial mistake was in thinking that 84 days later would be same day, but actually, the total days from January 1 to March 25 is 84 days, but since January 1 is day 1, the number of days after January 1 is 83. Therefore, 83 days later is 11 weeks and 6 days, which is 6 days after Saturday, which is Friday. Therefore, the correct answer is Friday.\n</think>", "Friday"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the third Thursday in November 2022. Express your answer as a number. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the day of the month for the third Thursday in November 2022. Hmm, first, maybe I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Once I know that, I can count the Thursdays.\n\nWait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check that. If that's correct, then the first Thursday would be the 3rd. Because November 1 is Tuesday, so the next day is Wednesday (2nd), then Thursday is the 3rd. So the first Thursday is the 3rd. Then the second Thursday would be the 10th, and the third would be the 17th. So the third Thursday is the 17th. Therefore, the answer should be 17. But wait, maybe I should verify this again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the days. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then:\n\n- 1st: Tuesday\n- 2nd: Wednesday\n- 3rd: Thursday (1st Thursday)\n- 10th: Thursday (2nd)\n- 17th: Thursday (3rd)\n- 24th: Thursday (4th)\n- 31st: Thursday (5th)\n\nWait, November has 30 days, right? So 31st is not there. So the fifth Thursday would be the 24th? Wait, no. Wait, if the 17th is the third Thursday, then adding 7 days would be 24th, which is the fourth. Then the fifth would be 31st, but November only has 30 days. So the fifth Thursday would be the 31st, which doesn't exist. So the third Thursday is the 17th. So the answer is 17. But I need to make sure that November 1, 2022, was indeed a Tuesday. Maybe I can check an online calendar or use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, but that might not help directly. Let me think. If I can find the day of the week for November 1, 2022, based on known dates. For example, I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November has 30 days. Let me think of another way. Let me check the actual calendar for November 2022. Wait, since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year. So February had 28 days. But how does that help? Maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. If that's correct, then I can count the days. Let's see:\n\nJanuary 1, 2022: Sunday.\n\nThen, each month's first day can be calculated by adding the number of days in the previous months. For example, February has 28 days, so March 1 is 28 days after January 1. 28 days is 4 weeks, so March 1, 2022, would also be a Sunday. Then April 1 is 28 + 29 (March has 31 days? Wait, March has 31 days. Wait, no. Wait, February 2022 has 28 days. So March 1 is 28 days after January 1. So 28 days is 4 weeks, so March 1 is Sunday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So June 1 is Friday + 3 days = Monday. July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So July 1 is Monday + 2 days = Wednesday. August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So August 1 is Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday. September 1 is 31 days after August 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So September 1 is Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So October 1 is Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday. November 1 is 31 days after October 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So November 1 is Thursday + 3 days = Sunday? Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought that November 1 was a Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022, is a Sunday, then:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So February 1 is 31 days after January 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 is Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. Then March 1 is 28 days after February 1 (since February 2022 has 28 days). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is Wednesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 is Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday. Wait, but earlier I thought April 1 was Wednesday. That's conflicting. So maybe my previous calculation was wrong. Let me redo this step by step.\n\nStarting with January 1, 2022: Sunday.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So February 1 is Wednesday.\n\nFebruary has 28 days, so March 1 is 28 days after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is Wednesday.\n\nMarch has 31 days. April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. So April 1 is Saturday.\n\nApril has 30 days. May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. So May 1 is Monday.\n\nMay has 31 days. June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Monday + 3 days is Thursday. June 1 is Thursday.\n\nJune has 30 days. July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. July 1 is Saturday.\n\nJuly has 31 days. August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. August 1 is Tuesday.\n\nAugust has 31 days. September 1 is 31 days after August 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. September 1 is Friday.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Friday + 2 days is Sunday. October 1 is Sunday.\n\nOctober has 31 days. November 1 is 31 days after October 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. November 1 is Wednesday. Wait, but earlier I thought November 1 was Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. Maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that. Wait, I think I remember that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. But according to this calculation, November 1, 2022, would be a Wednesday. But if that's the case, then the first Thursday in November would be the 2nd (since November 1 is Wednesday, so 2nd is Thursday). Then the third Thursday would be the 9th (first is 2nd, second is 9th, third is 16th). Wait, but that would make the third Thursday the 16th. But this contradicts my previous thought. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again step by step.\n\nStarting with January 1, 2022: Sunday.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So February 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Correct.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. March 1 is 28 days later. 28 mod 7 is 0. So March 1 is Wednesday. Correct.\n\nMarch has 31 days. April 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. Correct.\n\nApril has 30 days. May 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Correct.\n\nMay has 31 days. June 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Monday + 3 days is Thursday. Correct.\n\nJune has 30 days. July 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. Correct.\n\nJuly has 31 days. August 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. Correct.\n\nAugust has 31 days. September 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. Correct.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. October 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Friday + 2 days is Sunday. Correct.\n\nOctober has 31 days. November 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So November 1 is Wednesday. Therefore, November 1 is Wednesday. So the first Thursday is November 2. Then the second Thursday is the 9th, third is the 16th. So the third Thursday is the 16th. But earlier I thought it was the 17th. So which is correct?\n\nWait, but if November 1 is Wednesday, then:\n\n1: Wed\n\n2: Thu (1st Thursday)\n\n3: Fri\n\n4: Sat\n\n5: Sun\n\n6: Mon\n\n7: Tue\n\n8: Wed\n\n9: Thu (2nd Thursday)\n\n10: Fri\n\n11: Sat\n\n12: Sun\n\n13: Mon\n\n14: Tue\n\n15: Wed\n\n16: Thu (3rd Thursday)\n\n17: Fri\n\nSo the third Thursday is the 16th. Therefore, the answer should be 16. But earlier I thought it was 17 because I thought November 1 was Tuesday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh, the key is whether November 1, 2022, is a Wednesday or Tuesday. If the calculation shows that it's Wednesday, then the third Thursday is the 16th. But if I was wrong in the initial assumption that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday, then the calculation is wrong. So I need to verify the correct day of the week for January 1, 2022.\n\nWait, I think I can check this by another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So if I can find the day of the week for January 1, 2022, based on that. Since 2022 is not a leap year, there are 365 days between January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2023. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023, is one day later in the week than January 1, 2022. Since January 1, 2023, is a Sunday, then January 1, 2022, must be a Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous assumption that it was a Sunday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if January 1, 2023, is a Sunday, then January 1, 2022, would be 365 days before. Since 365 mod 7 is 1, so subtracting 1 day from Sunday would be Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So my previous calculation was wrong. That means I made a mistake in the earlier step-by-step calculation. So let's redo the calculation with January 1, 2022, as a Saturday.\n\nStarting again:\n\nJanuary 1, 2022: Saturday.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. February 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. March 1 is 28 days later. 28 mod 7 is 0. So March 1 is Tuesday.\n\nMarch has 31 days. April 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. April 1 is Friday.\n\nApril has 30 days. May 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Friday + 2 days is Sunday. May 1 is Sunday.\n\nMay has 31 days. June 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. June 1 is Wednesday.\n\nJune has 30 days. July 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. July 1 is Friday.\n\nJuly has 31 days. August 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Friday + 3 days is Monday. August 1 is Monday.\n\nAugust has 31 days. September 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Monday + 3 days is Thursday. September 1 is Thursday.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. October 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. October 1 is Saturday.\n\nOctober has 31 days. November 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. November 1 is Tuesday. Ah, now this matches my initial thought. So November 1, 2022, is a Tuesday. Therefore, the first Thursday is the 3rd (since 1 is Tuesday, 2 is Wednesday, 3 is Thursday). Then the second Thursday is the 10th, third is the 17th. So the third Thursday is the 17th. Therefore, the answer should be 17.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought January 1 was Sunday, I got November 1 as Wednesday, but that was wrong because January 1, 2022, is actually a Saturday. So the correct calculation shows that November 1 is Tuesday. Therefore, the third Thursday is the 17th. So the answer is 17.\n</think>", "17"], [124, "Count the occurrences of Thursday from Sunday, April 3 to Tuesday, June 28, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

First, I should figure out the dates of each Thursday in that range.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way than listing all the dates. Let me think. The total number of days between the start and end dates, then divide by 7 and adjust for the starting day. But I need to make sure that the start and end dates are included. Let me check the dates first.\n\nFirst, April 3, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to remember or calculate. Let me think. April 1, 2022 was a Friday. So April 1 is Friday, then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. Yes, that's correct. So the start date is Sunday, April 3.\n\nThe end date is June 28, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let me check that. Let's see, April has 30 days. So April 3 is Sunday. Let's count the days from April 3 to June 28.\n\nFirst, April: from April 3 to April 30. That's 30 - 3 = 27 days, but since April 3 is included, the number of days in April is 28 days (from April 3 to April 30 inclusive is 28 days? Wait, April 3 is day 1, April 4 is day 2, ..., April 30 is day 28. So 28 days in April. Then May has 31 days, and June has 28 days up to June 28. Wait, June 28 is the end date. So total days from April 3 to June 28 inclusive is 28 (April) + 31 (May) + 28 (June) = 87 days? Wait, wait, no. Wait, April 3 to April 30 is 28 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 28 + 31 = 59 days. Then June 1 to June 28 is 28 days. So total is 59 + 28 = 87 days. So the total number of days between April 3 and June 28 inclusive is 87 days.\n\nNow, since the start date is a Sunday, the first day is Sunday. So the first Thursday would be April 3 + 3 days, which is April 6. Then every 7 days after that. So the Thursdays would be April 6, 13, 20, 27, May 4, 11, 18, 25, June 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Wait, but June 29 is beyond June 28. So let me check.\n\nWait, the end date is June 28. So the last Thursday would be June 22, 2022. Let me check. Let's count the Thursdays step by step.\n\nStarting from April 3 (Sunday), the next Thursday is April 6 (3 days later). Then each week after that. Let's list them:\n\nApril 6, 13, 20, 27. Then May 4, 11, 18, 25. Then June 1, 8, 15, 22. Then June 29 would be the next one, but that's after June 28. So that's the last one. So how many Thursdays is that?\n\nApril: 4 Thursdays (6,13,20,27). May: 4 Thursdays (4,11,18,25). June: 4 Thursdays (1,8,15,22). Wait, but June 22 is within the range. So that's 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 Thursdays. But wait, let me check if the total days is 87. Let me check if 12 Thursdays would fit into 87 days. Since 12 weeks would be 84 days, so 87 days is 12 weeks and 3 days. So starting from Sunday, adding 12 weeks (84 days) would be Sunday again. Then the next three days would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So the end date is Tuesday, June 28. So the last Thursday would be June 22, which is 84 days after April 3. Then adding 3 days would be June 25 (Monday?), wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial count is wrong. Let me check each month's Thursdays again.\n\nApril 3 is Sunday. So April 6 is Thursday. Then April 13 (6+7), 20, 27. That's four Thursdays in April. Then May 4 (27 + 7 = 34th day of the year?), but May 4 is Thursday. Then May 11, 18, 25. That's four in May. Then June 1 is Thursday (May 25 + 7 days is June 1). Then June 8, 15, 22. That's four in June. So total 4+4+4=12. But wait, June 22 is the last Thursday. Then June 29 would be the next one, but that's beyond June 28. So that's 12 Thursdays. But wait, the total days between April 3 and June 28 is 87 days. Let me check if 12 Thursdays would fit. 12 Thursdays would be 12*7=84 days. But since the start date is a Sunday, the first Thursday is day 3 (April 6). Then the next is day 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66, 73, 80, 87. Wait, that's 12 Thursdays. Wait, day 87 is June 28. So the 12th Thursday is day 87. So that would mean that June 28 is a Thursday? But earlier I thought June 28 was a Tuesday. Wait, that's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that June 28 is a Tuesday is wrong. Let me check again. Let me try to figure out the day of the week for June 28, 2022.\n\nStarting from April 3, 2022, which is a Sunday. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nApril has 30 days. So April 3 is Sunday. April 3 + 27 days is April 30. 27 days later is 3 weeks and 6 days. So April 30 is Sunday + 6 days = Saturday. So April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. May has 31 days. So May 1 is Sunday. May 31 is Sunday + 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 31 is Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday, June 5 is Sunday, June 6 is Monday, June 7 is Tuesday, June 8 is Wednesday, June 9 is Thursday, etc. Wait, but June 28 is the end date. Let me count from June 1 (Wednesday) to June 28.\n\nJune has 30 days. So June 1 is Wednesday. June 28 is 27 days later. 27 days is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. So June 28 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So the end date is Tuesday. But according to the previous calculation, the 12th Thursday is day 87, which would be June 28. But that's a Tuesday. So that's a problem. So that suggests that my previous count of Thursdays is wrong.\n\nWait, so if the 12th Thursday is day 87, which is June 28, but that's a Tuesday, that can't be. Therefore, my mistake must be in the calculation of the days. Let me check again.\n\nLet me list the dates of the Thursdays. Starting from April 6 (Thursday). Then each week after that. Let's count them:\n\nApril 6 (1), 13 (2), 20 (3), 27 (4). Then May 4 (5), 11 (6), 18 (7), 25 (8). Then June 1 (9), 8 (10), 15 (11), 22 (12). Then June 29 (13) would be the next one. But June 29 is after June 28. So the last Thursday is June 22. So that's 12 Thursdays. But according to the day count, June 22 is the 12th Thursday. Let me check what day of the week June 22 is. June 1 is Wednesday. June 22 is 21 days later. 21 days is 3 weeks, so June 22 is also Wednesday. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 8 is Wednesday (7 days later). June 15 is Wednesday, June 22 is Wednesday. So June 22 is a Wednesday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought June 22 is a Thursday. Wait, that's a problem. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 2 is Thursday. So June 2 is Thursday. Then June 9 is Thursday, June 16, 23, 30. So June 23 is Thursday. Wait, but June 22 is Wednesday. So the Thursday after June 1 is June 2. Then the Thursdays in June would be June 2, 9, 16, 23. But that's four Thursdays in June. But earlier I thought June 1 was a Thursday. That's where the mistake was. So my previous count was wrong. So let me correct that.\n\nWait, April 6 is Thursday. Then April 13, 20, 27. Then May 4, 11, 18, 25. Then June 1 is Thursday? Wait, no. Wait, May 25 is Thursday. Then May 25 + 7 days is June 1. So June 1 is Thursday. Wait, but earlier I thought June 1 was Wednesday. That's the mistake. So where is the error in the previous calculation?\n\nEarlier, I thought that May 31 is Tuesday, so June 1 is Wednesday. But that's wrong. Let me recheck that. Let's start again.\n\nApril 3 is Sunday. April 30 is Saturday (as before). May 1 is Sunday. May has 31 days. So May 1 is Sunday. May 8 is Sunday, May 15, 22, 29. Then May 30 is Saturday, May 31 is Sunday. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, May 1 is Sunday. Then May 1 + 30 days is May 31. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 31 is Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday (7 days later), May 15, 22, 29. Then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion that June 1 is Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if May 25 is Thursday (from the previous count of May 4, 11, 18, 25). So May 25 is Thursday. Then May 25 + 7 days is June 1. So June 1 is Thursday. But according to the other calculation, June 1 is Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Which is correct?\n\nLet me check again. Let's take May 25 as Thursday. Then May 25 is Thursday. Then May 26 is Friday, 27 Saturday, 28 Sunday, 29 Monday, 30 Tuesday, 31 Wednesday. So May 31 is Wednesday. Then June 1 is Thursday. So that's correct. So earlier when I thought May 31 was Tuesday, that was wrong. So where did that mistake come from?\n\nEarlier, I thought that May 1 is Sunday, and May 31 is 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. But that's wrong. Wait, 30 days is 4 weeks (28 days) plus 2 days. So if May 1 is Sunday, then May 28 is Sunday (28 days later). Then May 29 is Monday, May 30 is Tuesday, May 31 is Wednesday. So May 31 is Wednesday. Therefore, June 1 is Thursday. So that's correct. So my previous mistake was in the calculation of May 31. So that explains the confusion.\n\nSo June 1 is Thursday. Then June 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. But June 29 is after June 28, so the last Thursday in June is June 22. So that's four Thursdays in June. So total Thursdays would be April (4) + May (4) + June (4) = 12. But wait, June 22 is Thursday. Let me check what day June 22 is. June 1 is Thursday. June 22 is 21 days later. 21 days is 3 weeks, so June 22 is also Thursday. So that's correct. Then June 29 is the next Thursday, which is after June 28. So the total is 12 Thursdays. But earlier, when I thought that June 28 is Tuesday, that's correct. So the total number of days between April 3 and June 28 is 87 days. Let me check again. April 3 to April 30 is 28 days. May has 31 days, so 28 + 31 = 59. June 1 to June 28 is 28 days. 59 + 28 = 87. So 87 days. Now, if there are 12 Thursdays, that would mean that the first day is Sunday, and the last day is Tuesday. Let me check the days of the week for the first and last days. April 3 is Sunday. The 87th day is June 28, which is Tuesday. So the first day is Sunday, the last day is Tuesday. So the number of Thursdays would be 12. Because in 87 days, starting on Sunday, the number of Thursdays would be 12. Let me check with another approach. The first Thursday is day 3 (April 6). The last Thursday is day 87 (June 28). Wait, but June 28 is Tuesday. So that can't be. Wait, this is conflicting again. Wait, if June 28 is Tuesday, then how can it be a Thursday? There's a contradiction here. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, if June 1 is Thursday, then June 1 is day 84 (since April 3 is day 1, April 3 + 84 days is June 1). Wait, let me check. April has 30 days. April 3 is day 1. April 3 + 27 days is April 30 (day 28). Then May has 31 days, so May 31 is day 28 + 31 = 59. Then June 1 is day 60. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the total days. Let me recalculate the total number of days from April 3 to June 28 inclusive.\n\nApril 3 to April 30: 30 - 3 + 1 = 28 days. Wait, because inclusive. So April 3 is day 1, April 4 is day 2, ..., April 30 is day 28. Then May has 31 days, so May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 28 is 28 days. So total is 28 + 31 + 28 = 87 days. So the total is 87 days. So April 3 is day 1, June 28 is day 87. Now, if June 1 is day 28 + 31 = 60? Wait, April 3 is day 1. April 30 is day 28. Then May 1 is day 29, May 2 is 30, ..., May 31 is day 28 + 31 = 59. Then June 1 is day 60. June 28 is day 60 + 27 = 87. So June 1 is day 60. Now, if June 1 is Thursday, then day 60 is Thursday. Then day 60 + 7 = day 67 is Thursday (June 8), day 74 (June 15), day 81 (June 22"], [124, "Between Tuesday, April 12, 2022 and Wednesday, June 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Monday occur? Write the total number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many Mondays there are between Tuesday, April 12, 2022, and Wednesday, June 1, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. Alright, first, maybe I should find out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many weeks there are, which would give me the number of Mondays. But wait, since the start and end dates might not align perfectly with the weeks, I need to check the exact days.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The period starts on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, and ends on Wednesday, June 1, 2022. Both dates are included. So I need to count all the Mondays in this range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the day of the week for April 12, 2022, and then count how many Mondays fall between that date and June 1. Let me check what day April 12, 2022, was. Wait, the problem says it's a Tuesday. So April 12 is a Tuesday. Then, I need to find the number of Mondays from that date up to June 1, inclusive.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between those dates and then divide by 7, but considering the starting day. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days from April 12 to June 1, inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 12 to April 30 inclusive is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 is one day. So total days would be 19 (April) + 31 (May) + 1 (June) = 51 days? Wait, wait. Wait, if the start date is April 12 and the end date is June 1, then the total days would be (June 1 - April 12) + 1. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of days step by step. Let's see:\n\nApril 12 to April 30: 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since both ends are inclusive, it's 18 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 is 1 day. So total days is 19 + 31 + 1 = 51 days. So total of 51 days in the period.\n\nNow, if there are 51 days, then how many weeks are there? 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 2 days. So 7 weeks would be 49 days, leaving 2 days. So if the first day is Tuesday, then the next day is Wednesday, and the last day is Thursday? Wait, but the total days are 51. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, if April 12 is Tuesday, then adding 7 days would be April 19 (Tuesday), 26 (Tuesday), then May 3 (Tuesday), 10, 17, 24, 31 (Tuesday). Then June 7 would be the next Tuesday. But the period ends on June 1. So the last day is June 1, which is Wednesday. So the total days from April 12 to June 1 is 51 days. Let me check that again. Let me count the days between April 12 and June 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar. But since I don't have a calendar here, I need to calculate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the number of Mondays by checking each month.\n\nFirst, April 12 is a Tuesday. So the first Monday after April 12 would be April 11, but that's before the start date. Wait, the start date is April 12. So the first Monday in the period would be April 11? No, because April 12 is Tuesday. So the previous Monday is April 11, which is before the start date. So the first Monday in the period would be April 18? Wait, April 12 is Tuesday. Then April 13 is Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday. So the first Monday in the period is April 18. Then the next Mondays would be 25, May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, and then June 6, 13, 20, 27. But the period ends on June 1. So June 1 is Wednesday. So the last Monday would be May 30, which is a Monday. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let's list all the Mondays in the period:\n\nStarting from April 18 (Monday), then adding 7 days each time:\n\nApril 18, 25.\n\nMay 2, 9, 16, 23, 30.\n\nJune 6, 13, 20, 27. But June 1 is the end date, so June 6 is after June 1. So the last Monday in the period is May 30.\n\nSo how many Mondays are there?\n\nApril 18, 25: that's 2.\n\nMay 2, 9, 16, 23, 30: that's 5.\n\nTotal of 2 + 5 = 7 Mondays. Wait, but wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me count each month.\n\nApril: April 18 and 25. That's two Mondays.\n\nMay: May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five Mondays.\n\nJune: June 1 is Wednesday, so the next Monday would be June 6, which is outside the period. So only 5 Mondays in May. So total is 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nBut wait, the total days are 51. 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 2 days. So 7 weeks would have 7 Mondays. But since the period starts on Tuesday and ends on Wednesday, the extra two days would be Tuesday and Wednesday. So that would mean that there are 7 Mondays. Which matches the count above. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check April 18, 2022. Let me check what day that was. Wait, the problem says April 12 is Tuesday. So April 12 is Tuesday. Then April 13 is Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday. Yes, that's correct. So April 18 is Monday. Then adding 7 days, April 25 is Monday. Then May 2 is Monday. Then May 9, 16, 23, 30. Then June 6 is next. So that's 2 + 5 = 7 Mondays. So the answer is 7?\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the period includes June 1. So if May 30 is a Monday, then June 1 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So the total number of Mondays is 7. But let me check again. Let me count the days again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the total number of days. If there are 51 days, and the first day is Tuesday, then the days of the week would be:\n\nDay 1: Tuesday (April 12)\n\nDay 2: Wednesday\n\nDay 3: Thursday\n\nDay 4: Friday\n\nDay 5: Saturday\n\nDay 6: Sunday\n\nDay 7: Monday (April 18)\n\nDay 8: Tuesday (April 19)\n\n... and so on. So every 7 days, the same day of the week repeats. So in 51 days, how many Mondays are there?\n\nThe first Monday is day 7 (April 18). Then day 14 (April 25), day 21 (May 2), day 28 (May 9), day 35 (May 16), day 42 (May 23), day 49 (May 30). Then day 56 would be June 6, which is beyond the period. So the Mondays are on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49. That's 7 Mondays. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 7.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"between Tuesday, April 12, 2022 and Wednesday, June 1, 2022 (counting both dates)\". So the total days are 51. So the answer is 7. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 7.\n</think>", "7"], [124, "In December 2022, if an event recurs on the second Wednesday, what is the date (day of the month) of the event? Express your answer as a number. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the date of the second Wednesday in December 2022. Let me start by recalling what day December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think about December 2022. Let me try to count the days. If December 1 is a Thursday, then the first Wednesday would be the 7th? Wait, no. Wait, if December 1 is Thursday, then the first Wednesday would be the 7th? Wait, no. Wait, December 1 is Thursday. So the first Wednesday would be the 7th? Wait, no. Wait, December 1 is Thursday. Then the next day, December 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday, 5 is Monday, 6 is Tuesday, 7 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday is the 7th. Then the second Wednesday would be the 14th. Wait, but that would be the second occurrence. So the answer would be 14? But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, if December 1 is Thursday, then December 21 would be 20 days later. Let's count the days. 20 days later. Since 7 days is a week, 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Thursday would be Thursday + 6 days = Wednesday. So that's correct. So December 21 is a Wednesday. Therefore, the first Wednesday is the 7th, the second is the 14th, the third is the 21st, and the fourth is the 28th. So the second Wednesday would be the 14th. Therefore, the answer should be 14. But wait, maybe I need to check if December 2022 actually has 31 days. Yes, December has 31 days. So the second Wednesday is definitely the 14th. So the answer is 14. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me think again. If December 1 is Thursday, then the first Wednesday is the 7th. Then the second is 14th. That seems correct. So the answer is 14. But I need to make sure that December 1, 2022, was indeed a Thursday. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that December 31, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me check that. If December 31 is Saturday, then December 31 minus 7 days is December 24, which would be Saturday as well. Then December 24 is Saturday. Then December 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday. Wait, but earlier I thought December 21 was Wednesday. Wait, if December 21 is Wednesday, then December 22 is Thursday, 23 is Friday, 24 is Saturday, 25 is Sunday, 26 is Monday, 27 is Tuesday, 28 is Wednesday, 29 is Thursday, 30 is Friday, 31 is Saturday. So that would make December 21 a Wednesday. So if December 21 is Wednesday, then December 1 would be 20 days earlier. 20 days before December 21. Let's count. 21 - 20 = 1. So December 1 is 20 days before. Since 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So if December 21 is Wednesday, then subtracting 6 days would be Wednesday minus 6 days. Wednesday minus 1 day is Tuesday, minus 2 is Monday, minus 3 is Sunday, minus 4 is Saturday, minus 5 is Friday, minus 6 is Thursday. So December 1 is Thursday. That matches my initial thought. Therefore, the first Wednesday is the 7th, second is 14th. So the answer is 14. Therefore, the answer should be 14.\n</think>", "14"], [124, "Between Saturday, March 19, 2022 and Sunday, May 8, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? State the amount as a number.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of business days between March 19, 2022 (Saturday) and May 8, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday. So, first, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates and then subtract the weekends.\n\nFirst, let me check the dates. March 19 is a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Wait, March 19, 2022: I think that was a Saturday. Let me check. Well, maybe I can count the days. But maybe I should just proceed step by step.\n\nSo the period is from March 19 to May 8, inclusive. Let me break this down into months. March 19 to March 31, then April 1 to April 30, and then May 1 to May 8.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of days in each month segment.\n\nMarch 19 to March 31: March has 31 days. So from March 19 to March 31 inclusive. Let's calculate that. March 19 is day 1, March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13. Wait, 31 minus 19 is 12 days, but since both start and end dates are included, it's 13 days. Wait, 31 - 19 + 1 = 13 days. So that's 13 days in March.\n\nThen April has 30 days. So April 1 to April 30 is 30 days.\n\nThen May 1 to May 8 is 8 days.\n\nSo total days from March 19 to May 8 inclusive is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. Wait, 13 + 30 is 43, plus 8 is 51. So total 51 days.\n\nNow, out of these 51 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)? Then subtract those from 51 to get business days.\n\nBut since the start date is a Saturday (March 19), I need to check each week's days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weekends in each month segment.\n\nFirst, March 19 is a Saturday. Let's check the days in March.\n\nMarch 19 (Saturday), March 20 (Sunday), March 21 (Monday), March 22 (Tuesday), March 23 (Wednesday), March 24 (Thursday), March 25 (Friday), March 26 (Saturday), March 27 (Sunday), March 28 (Monday), March 29 (Tuesday), March 30 (Wednesday), March 31 (Thursday). Wait, March 31 is a Thursday? Let me check that again. Wait, March 19 is Saturday. So March 20 is Sunday. Then March 21 is Monday. March 22 is Tuesday. March 23 is Wednesday. March 24 is Thursday. March 25 is Friday. March 26 is Saturday. March 27 is Sunday. March 28 is Monday. March 29 is Tuesday. March 30 is Wednesday. March 31 is Thursday. So yes, March 31 is a Thursday. So in March, from March 19 to March 31, there are 13 days. Let's count the weekends here. March 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). So that's 4 weekend days. Wait, March 19 is Saturday, 20 Sunday. Then March 26 is Saturday, 27 Sunday. So that's 4 days. So in March, 4 weekend days.\n\nThen April. April 1 is a Friday. Wait, because March 31 is Thursday. So April 1 is Friday. Let me check that. March 31 is Thursday, so April 1 is Friday. Then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday, April 4 is Monday, etc. So April has 30 days. Let's count the number of weekends in April. Since April 1 is Friday, the first weekend is April 2 (Sat) and 3 (Sun). Then the next weekend is April 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun), then 16, 17, 23, 24, 30 (Sat?), wait. Wait, April 30 is the last day. Let me check. April 1 is Friday. So April 1 is Friday, 2 Saturday, 3 Sunday. Then April 4 is Monday. Then each week cycles. So the weekends in April would be:\n\nWeek 1: 2,3 (Sat, Sun)\n\nWeek 2: 9,10\n\nWeek 3: 16,17\n\nWeek 4: 23,24\n\nWeek 5: 30, 31 (but April only has 30 days). Wait, April 30 is the last day. So the last weekend would be April 30 (Saturday) and April 31 (Sunday) but April 31 doesn't exist. So only April 30 is Saturday. So in April, the weekends are 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24,30. That's 9 days. Wait, let me count again. From April 2 to April 3 (2 days), then 9-10 (2), 16-17 (2), 23-24 (2), and 30 (1 day). So total 2+2+2+2+1=9 days. So 9 weekend days in April.\n\nThen May 1 to May 8. May 1 is a Monday (since April 30 is Saturday, so May 1 is Sunday? Wait, wait. Wait, April 30 is Saturday. So May 1 is Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if April 30 is Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. Wait, but earlier I thought April 1 is Friday. Let me check again. March 31 is Thursday. April 1 is Friday. Then April 2 is Saturday, 3 Sunday. Then April 4 is Monday. Then April 1 is Friday, so April 7 is Thursday, April 8 is Friday, April 9 is Saturday. So April 30 is Saturday? Wait, April has 30 days. Let me count the days in April. April 1 is Friday. So April 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu), 8 (Fri), 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun), 11 (Mon), 12 (Tue), 13 (Wed), 14 (Thu), 15 (Fri), 16 (Sat), 17 (Sun), 18 (Mon), 19 (Tue), 20 (Wed), 21 (Thu), 22 (Fri), 23 (Sat), 24 (Sun), 25 (Mon), 26 (Tue), 27 (Wed), 28 (Thu), 29 (Fri), 30 (Sat). So yes, April 30 is Saturday. Therefore, May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday, May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. So the days in May from May 1 to May 8 are 8 days. Now, the weekends in this period are May 1 (Sunday), May 7 (Saturday), and May 8 (Sunday). So that's 3 weekend days. Wait, May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, so May 1 is a weekend day. Then May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. So that's 3 weekend days in May.\n\nSo total weekend days: March (4) + April (9) + May (3) = 16 days. Therefore, total business days would be 51 total days minus 16 weekend days = 35 business days. Wait, but let me check again. Wait, March had 13 days, April 30, May 8. Total 51 days. 51 - 16 = 35. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check again.\n\nMarch: 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 4 days. Correct.\n\nApril: 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24,30. That's 9 days. Correct.\n\nMay: 1,7,8. That's 3 days. So 4+9+3=16. So 51-16=35. So the answer is 35?\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from March 19 (Saturday). Since business days are Monday-Friday. So March 19 is Saturday, not a business day. March 20 is Sunday, also not. March 21 is Monday (business). March 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri). Then March 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). March 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), 31 (Thu). So in March, from March 19 to March 31, the business days are March 21-25 (5 days), March 28-31 (4 days). So 5+4=9 business days in March.\n\nThen April. April 1 is Friday (business day). April 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun) non-business. April 4 (Mon) business. So in April, each week has 5 business days. April has 30 days. Let's see how many weeks. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks would be 28 days, which is 4*5=20 business days. Then the remaining 2 days are April 29 (Fri) and 30 (Sat). Wait, April 29 is Friday (business day), April 30 is Saturday (non-business). So adding 1 more business day. So total business days in April would be 20 +1=21? Wait, but wait. Wait, April 1 is Friday. So the first week of April: April 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu). So business days are 1,4,5,6,7 (Fri, Mon-Fri). Wait, but that's 5 business days. Then the next week is 8-14, which is 5 business days. Then 15-21, 5 days. Then 22-28, 5 days. Then 29-30: 29 is Friday, 30 is Saturday. So business days in April would be 5*4 (for the first four weeks) plus 1 (April 29). So 20 +1=21. So 21 business days in April.\n\nThen May. May 1 is Sunday (non-business), May 2 (Mon), 3 (Tue), 4 (Wed), 5 (Thu), 6 (Fri), 7 (Sat), 8 (Sun). So business days in May are May 2-6 (5 days) and May 8 is Sunday, so not. So 5 business days in May.\n\nSo total business days: March (9) + April (21) + May (5) = 35. So that's 35. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 35.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because when I calculated the total days as 51, and subtracted 16 weekends, getting 35. And when I calculated business days directly, also 35. So that seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should check another way. Let's use the formula for business days between two dates. But since I don't have a calculator here, I need to do it manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the number of weeks. From March 19 to May 8. Let's see. March 19 is Saturday.

From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2043 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2043 divided by 4. 4 times 510 is 2040, so 2043 minus 2040 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 2043 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check the rules to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nThe rules are: 1) divisible by 4, 2) if divisible by 100, must also be divisible by 400. So, if a year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year. But if it's divisible by 100 but not by 400, it's not. But 2043 isn't even divisible by 100. Let me confirm: 2043 divided by 100 is 20.43, so no, it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition doesn't apply here. Since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year.

First, I should figure out what day of the week August 5, 2022, is. Wait, the start date is Monday, August 5. Wait, the question says \"from Monday, August 5 to Monday, August 29\". Wait, but the start date is Monday, and the end date is also Monday. So maybe the total number of days between them is 25 days? Wait, no. Wait, August 5 is a Monday. Then August 29 is also a Monday. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me confirm the days. Let me think. If August 5 is a Monday, then adding 7 days would be August 12, 19, 26. Wait, but August 26 is a Monday. Then August 29 would be three days after that. So August 26 (Monday), 27 (Tuesday), 28 (Wednesday), 29 (Thursday). Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, maybe August 5 is a Monday. Let me check the actual calendar for 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that August 5 is a Monday. Let me check. Let's think about the days. If August 5 is a Monday, then August 5 is day 1. Then August 6 is Tuesday, 7 Wednesday, 8 Thursday, 9 Friday, 10 Saturday, 11 Sunday. Then August 12 is Monday again. So every 7 days. So August 5, 12, 19, 26 are Mondays. Then August 26 is a Monday. Then August 27 is Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday. So the end date is August 29, which is a Thursday. Wait, but the question says the end date is Monday, August 29. Wait, that contradicts. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe August 5 is not a Monday? Wait, the problem says the start date is Monday, August 5. So the user is saying that August 5 is a Monday. But according to my calculation, if August 5 is Monday, then August 29 would be Thursday. So that's a problem. Therefore, maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the dates? Or maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try again.

Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to adjust. Let me think. If August 5 is a Monday, then August 29 is a Thursday. Therefore, the end date is not a Monday. Therefore, maybe the problem has a mistake. But the user says the end date is Monday, August 29. Therefore, perhaps the start date is not August 5. Wait, but the problem says \"from Monday, August 5 to Monday, August 29\". So maybe the start date is Monday, August 5, and the end date is Monday, August 29. Therefore, the total number of days between them is 25 days? Wait, from August 5 to August 29 inclusive. Let me calculate the number of days. August 5 to August 29 is 25 days. Because 29 -5 =24, plus 1 is 25 days. So if the start date is Monday, then the end date would be 25 days later. Let me check what day of the week that would be. Since 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Monday would be Friday. Therefore, August 29 would be a Friday. But the problem says it's a Monday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps the start date is not August 5. Wait, but the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5. Therefore, maybe the problem is incorrect?

Wait, but the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5, and the end date is Monday, August 29. Therefore, the start and end dates are both Mondays. Therefore, the total number of days between them is 25 days. But if August 5 is a Monday, then August 29 is a Friday. Therefore, the problem's end date is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Alternatively, maybe the start date is not August 5. Wait, but the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5. Therefore, perhaps the problem is correct, and I need to find the number of Mondays between those dates, even if the end date is not a Monday. Wait, but the problem says the end date is Monday, August 29. Therefore, maybe the actual dates are different. Maybe the start date is August 5, which is a Monday, and the end date is August 29, which is a Monday. Therefore, the total number of days between them is 25 days. But according to my calculation, that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's think about the number of Mondays between August 5 and August 29 inclusive. Let's assume that August 5 is a Monday. Then the Mondays would be August 5, 12, 19, 26. Then August 26 is a Monday. Then August 27 is Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday. Therefore, the end date is Thursday. Therefore, the problem's end date is incorrect. Therefore, maybe the problem is wrong. But the user says that the end date is Monday, August 29. Therefore, perhaps the start date is not August 5. Alternatively, maybe the start date is August 5, which is a Monday, and the end date is August 29, which is a Monday. Therefore, the total number of days between them is 25 days. But that would mean that August 29 is 25 days after August 5. Let me check that. August 5 plus 25 days is August 29. Let me count: 5 + 25 = 30. August has 31 days, so August 5 + 25 days is August 30. Wait, no. Wait, 5 + 25 = 30. So August 30. Therefore, August 29 is 24 days after August 5. Therefore, the total number of days between August 5 and August 29 inclusive is 25 days. Therefore, if August 5 is a Monday, then August 29 is 24 days later. 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Monday would be Thursday. Therefore, August 29 is a Thursday. Therefore, the problem's end date is incorrect. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, maybe the problem is wrong. But the user is asking for the answer. Therefore, perhaps I need to proceed with the given dates, even if there's a discrepancy. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to find the number of Mondays between August 5 and August 29, inclusive, regardless of the actual days. Wait, but the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5, and the end date is Monday, August 29. Therefore, the user is assuming that August 29 is a Monday. Therefore, perhaps the actual dates are different. Maybe the start date is August 5, which is a Monday, and the end date is August 29, which is a Monday. Therefore, the total number of days between them is 25 days. Therefore, the number of Mondays would be 4 (August 5, 12, 19, 26) plus one more? Wait, but if August 29 is a Monday, then that would be the fifth Monday. But according to the previous calculation, August 26 is a Monday, then adding 3 days would be August 29. Therefore, that would mean that August 29 is a Thursday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is incorrect. But since the user is asking for the answer, maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the start date is Monday, August 5, and the end date is Monday, August 29, and calculate the number of Mondays between them. Therefore, the total number of days is 25. Since 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. Therefore, there are 4 Mondays in the first 28 days (3 weeks), but since it's 25 days, which is 3 weeks and 4 days, the number of Mondays would be 4. Because the first day is Monday, then the next three Mondays are 12, 19, 26. Then the next Monday would be 26 +7 = 33, which is beyond 29. Therefore, only 4 Mondays. But if the end date is August 29, which is a Monday, then that would be the fifth Monday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, maybe the problem is wrong. But since the user is asking for the answer, perhaps I should proceed with the given dates. Alternatively, maybe the start date is not August 5. Wait, maybe the start date is August 5, which is a Monday, and the end date is August 29, which is a Monday. Therefore, the total number of days between them is 25. Therefore, the number of Mondays is 4. But if the end date is a Monday, then that would be the fifth. Therefore, maybe the problem is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should check the actual calendar. Wait, I can't do that, but maybe I can use another method. Let me think. Let's take August 5, 2022. Let me check what day of the week that was. Wait, I remember that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. Wait, if January 1, 2022, is a Sunday, then January 2 is Monday. Then, let's count the number of days in each month. Let's see, August 5, 2022. Let's calculate the day of the week for August 5. Let's count the number of days from January 1 to August 5. January has 31 days, February 28 (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, and August 5. So total days from January 1 to August 5 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 5 (Aug) = let's calculate that. 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +31=212, +5=217. So 217 days from January 1 to August 5. Now, since January 1 is a Sunday, adding 217 days. Let's find the day of the week. 217 divided by 7 is 31 weeks and 0 days. Therefore, 217 days is exactly 31 weeks, so August 5, 2022, is also a Sunday. Wait, but that contradicts the problem's statement that August 5 is a Monday. Therefore, there's a problem here. Therefore, the problem's start date is incorrect. Therefore, the user must have made a mistake. But since the user is asking for the answer, maybe I should proceed with the correct day of the week. Wait, if August 5 is a Sunday, then the problem's start date is wrong. Therefore, maybe the user intended August 5 to be a Monday, but in reality, it's a Sunday. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is different. But since the user says that the start date is Monday, August 5, I need to proceed with that. Therefore, maybe the problem is hypothetical. Therefore, assuming that August 5 is a Monday, and August 29 is a Monday, then the number of Mondays is 4 (August 5, 12, 19, 26) plus August 29. Wait, but that would be 5 Mondays. But according to the previous calculation, if August 5 is Monday, then August 29 is Thursday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, maybe the problem is incorrect. But since the user is asking for the answer, perhaps I should proceed with the given dates. Therefore, the start date is Monday, August 5, and the end date is Monday, August 29. Therefore, the total number of days is 25. The number of Mondays would be 4 (since 25 days is 3 weeks and 4 days, so 3 Mondays plus the first day). Wait, no. If the first day is Monday, then the Mondays are on day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. But if the end date is day 25, then the last Monday would be day 22 (August 22). Then day 29 is beyond. Therefore, there are 4 Mondays. Therefore, the answer is 4. But if the end date is Monday, August 29, then that would be the fifth Monday. Therefore, there's a contradiction.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1950 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1950 divided by 4. 4 times 487 is 1948, so 1950 minus 1948 is 2. That leaves a remainder of 2, so 1950 is not divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check. Let me add the digits: 1+9+5+0=15. Wait, that's for divisibility by 3, not 4. Maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, 1950 divided by 4 is 487.5. Since it's not a whole number, that confirms it's not divisible by 4. So according to the first rule, since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. \n\nBut wait, what about century years?

For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 15 days would get me to May 16. Let me check: May 1 is Sunday, so May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, and so on. So each day increments by one. So May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, and May 16 would be Monday. So that would make May 16, 2022 a Monday. But wait, is May 1, 2022 actually a Sunday?\n\nWait, I need to confirm that. Let me think. If I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then April has 30 days. So April 1 is Friday, April 8 is Friday, April 15 is Friday, April 22 is Friday, and April 29 is Friday. Then May 1 would be the next day, which is Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So if April 1 is Friday, then May 1 is Saturday. But that would mean that May 1 is Saturday, so May 8 is Saturday, May 15 is Saturday, and May 16 would be Sunday. But that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, I think I need to check the actual dates. Wait, maybe I can use another method. Let me think about the year 2022. I know that 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. Let me check the days for some months. For example, if I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday, and so on. Then January 31 would be a Monday (since 31 days later). Wait, January has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Sunday, and January 31 is Monday. So that's correct. Then February 1, 2022 would be Tuesday. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is Tuesday + 27 days. Wait, 28 days later would be the same day of the week. So February 28 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Then March has 31 days. March 1 is Wednesday, March 8 is Wednesday, March 15, 22, 29. March 30 is Thursday, March 31 is Friday. Then April 1 is Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought where I thought April 1 was Friday. So if April 1 is Saturday, then May 1 would be the next month. April has 30 days. So April 1 is Saturday, April 8 is Saturday, April 15, 22, 29. Then April 30 is Sunday. So May 1 is Monday. Wait, that's different from before. So if May 1 is Monday, then May 16 would be 15 days later. So May 1 is Monday, May 8 is Monday, May 15 is Monday, so May 16 is Tuesday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion.

March 1 is Wednesday, March 8 is Wednesday, March 15 is Wednesday, March 22 is Wednesday, March 29 is Wednesday. Then March 30 is Thursday, March 31 is Friday. Then April 1 is Saturday. April has 30 days. April 1 is Saturday, April 8 is Saturday, April 15 is Saturday, April 22 is Saturday, April 29 is Saturday. Then April 30 is Sunday. So May 1 is Monday. Therefore, May 1 is Monday. Then May 16 is 15 days later. So May 1 is Monday, May 8 is Monday, May 15 is Monday, so May 16 is Tuesday. Therefore, May 16, 2022 is Tuesday. But I thought earlier that May 16 was Monday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Friday. Let's see if that aligns with the previous calculations. If May 1 is Monday, then May 8 is Monday, May 15 is Monday, May 16 is Tuesday. Then June 1 is Tuesday (since May has 31 days, so May 31 is Tuesday, June 1 is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Monday, May 8 is Monday, May 15 is Monday, May 16 is Tuesday. Then May 31 is 25 days after May 1. 25 days is 3 weeks and 4 days. So May 1 is Monday, adding 25 days would be Monday + 4 days = Friday. So May 31 is Friday. Then June 1 is Saturday. Then June has 30 days. June 1 is Saturday, June 8 is Saturday, June 15 is Saturday, June 22 is Saturday, June 29 is Saturday. Then July 1 is Sunday. July 4 is Wednesday? Wait, that contradicts the previous thought that July 4 was Monday. So if July 1 is Sunday, then July 4 is Wednesday. But I thought July 4 was Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my previous assumption that May 1 is Monday must be wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation.\n\nSo where did I go wrong? Let me retrace. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 31 is Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 28 is Tuesday. March 1 is Wednesday. March 31 is Friday. April 1 is Saturday. April 30 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. But according to that, July 1 is Sunday. Then July 4 is Wednesday. But I think that July 4, 2022 was actually a Monday. So that suggests that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is Saturday is wrong. Therefore, I need to correct that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another known date. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 is a common year. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 16, 2022 is a Tuesday. But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I know that May 16, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but how can I be sure? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 16, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but I need to find a way to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, and May 16 is Monday. But then July 4 would be... Let's see. May 1 is Sunday. May has 31 days, so May 31 is Tuesday. Then June has 30 days. June 1 is Wednesday. June 30 is Wednesday. July 1 is Thursday. July 4 is Sunday. Wait, that would make July 4 a Sunday. But I thought that July 4 was a Monday. So that's conflicting again. Therefore, I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let me check the number of days between two known dates. For example, if I know that May 16, 2022 is a certain day, and I can find another date that I know the day of the week for, then I can calculate. But since I don't have that, maybe I need to use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year. So the number of days in each month is as follows: January 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, etc.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if I know that a certain date in 2022 is a specific day, I can count forward or backward. For example, if I know that May 16 is a certain day, but I don't. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I know that May 16, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I know that May 16, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but I need to verify this.

Maybe I should try to use another method.\n\nLet me try to use the fact that I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. If that's true, then I can count back to May 16. Let's see. July 4 is Monday. July has 31 days. So July 4 is Monday. July 1 is Friday (since July 4 is Monday, subtract 3 days). Then June 30 is Thursday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is Thursday. Then May 31 is Wednesday. May 31 is Wednesday. Then May 16 is 15 days before May 31. So 15 days before May 31 is May 16. Let's count backwards: May 31 is Wednesday. May 24 is Wednesday. May 17 is Wednesday. May 16 is Tuesday. So that would make May 16, 2022 a Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, if July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Friday. Then June 30 is Thursday. Then May 31 is Wednesday. Then May 16 is Tuesday. So that would be correct. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But earlier calculations were conflicting, but this seems to be a more reliable method because it uses a known date (July 4, 2022) which I think is correct. So I think that May 16, 2022 was a Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [124, "On which weekday did April 5, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week April 5, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because January 1, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no, because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 would start on a Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday? Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Wait, if 2021 started on a Monday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would mean that January 1, 2022 is a Monday plus 1 day, which is Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean that January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. But I think I might be confused here. Let me check another way. Maybe I can look up some known dates. Wait, but since I can't actually look things up, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 5, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about some other dates. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then April 5 would be 4 days later. So Friday plus 4 days would be Tuesday? Wait, but that would make April 5 a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if April 1 was a Friday. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the days of the week for some other dates in 2022.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, if March 1 is a Tuesday, then March 7 is also a Tuesday. Then March 8 is Wednesday. Then March 15 is Tuesday again. Wait, but how does that help me with April 5? Let me think. March has 31 days. So March 31 is 31 days after March 1. Let me calculate how many days from March 1 to April 5. March has 31 days, so from March 1 to April 5 is 31 (March) + 5 (April) = 36 days? Wait, no. Wait, March 1 to March 31 is 30 days (since March 1 is day 1, March 2 is day 2, etc., so March 31 is day 31). Then April 1 is day 32, April 2 is 33, and so on. So April 5 is 31 + 5 = 36 days after March 1. Wait, but March 1 is a Tuesday. So adding 36 days to March 1. Let me calculate 36 days later. Since 7 days is a week, 36 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 1 day. So 5 weeks later is the same day, so adding 1 day. So if March 1 is a Tuesday, then March 1 + 36 days is Tuesday + 1 day = Wednesday. Wait, but that would mean April 5 is a Wednesday? But that contradicts my previous thought where I thought April 1 was a Friday. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another approach. Let me think about the day of the week for April 5, 2022. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. If that's correct, then April 5 would be 4 days later. So Friday + 4 days is Tuesday. But if that's the case, then April 5 is a Tuesday. But earlier calculation with March 1 being Tuesday led me to Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the correct day for March 1, 2022. Let me think. If April 1 is a Friday, then March 27, 2022 was a Friday as well. Because March has 31 days, so March 27 is 27 days before April 1. Wait, March 27 is 27 days before April 1. Let me check how many days that is. March has 31 days, so March 27 is 31 - 27 = 4 days before March 31. So March 27 is 4 days before March 31. So March 27 is 4 days before March 31. So if March 27 is a Friday, then March 31 is a Tuesday. Wait, because adding 4 days to Friday is Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean March 31 is a Tuesday. Then March 31 is a Tuesday. Then April 1 is a Wednesday. But that contradicts the earlier assumption that April 1 is a Friday. So there's a problem here. Therefore, my initial assumption that April 1 is a Friday must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let me think about the day of the week for a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, 2021 started on a Monday. So 2022 would start on a Tuesday. Wait, because 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 is 1 day after Monday, which is Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but that contradicts some other information I might have. Wait, maybe I need to check again. Let me think. If January 1, 2021 was a Monday, then January 1, 2022 would be 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Monday would be Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 is Tuesday. Then, let's count the days for February 1, 2022. January has 31 days. So February 1 is 31 days after January 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Tuesday would be Friday. So February 1, 2022 is a Friday. Then March 1 is 28 days after February 1 (since 2022 is not a leap year). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Friday. Wait, so March 1, 2022 is a Friday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is Friday, March 15 is Friday, March 22 is Friday, March 29 is Friday. Then April 5 is 6 days after March 29. March 29 is Friday, so April 5 is Friday + 6 days. Friday + 1 is Saturday, +2 Sunday, +3 Monday, +4 Tuesday, +5 Wednesday, +6 Thursday. So April 5 would be a Thursday? But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought March 1 was Tuesday. Wait, but according to this, March 1 is Friday. So where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nWait, earlier I thought March 1 was Tuesday, but according to this calculation, March 1 is Friday. So that was the mistake. So if March 1 is Friday, then March 8 is Friday, March 15 is Friday, March 22 is Friday, March 29 is Friday. Then April 5 is 6 days after March 29. So March 29 is Friday, April 5 is Friday + 6 days. Let's count:\n\nMarch 29: Friday\n\nMarch 30: Saturday\n\nMarch 31: Sunday\n\nApril 1: Monday\n\nApril 2: Tuesday\n\nApril 3: Wednesday\n\nApril 4: Thursday\n\nApril 5: Friday\n\nWait, that's 6 days later. Wait, March 29 to April 5 is 6 days. So April 5 would be Friday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought March 1 was Tuesday. So clearly, there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning. So according to this, April 5, 2022 is a Friday. But that seems conflicting with the previous thought where I thought April 1 was a Friday. Wait, but according to this, April 1 is a Monday. So if April 1 is Monday, then April 5 is Friday. That would make sense. But how does that fit with the previous calculation where I thought March 1 was Tuesday? That must have been wrong. So where is the error?\n\nLet me retrace. If January 1, 2022 is Tuesday, then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. So February 1 is Friday. Then March 1 is 28 days after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also Friday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is Friday, March 15 is Friday, March 22 is Friday, March 29 is Friday. Then April 5 is 6 days after March 29. So March 29 is Friday, April 5 is Friday + 6 days. Let's count:\n\nMarch 29: Friday\n\nMarch 30: Saturday\n\nMarch 31: Sunday\n\nApril 1: Monday\n\nApril 2: Tuesday\n\nApril 3: Wednesday\n\nApril 4: Thursday\n\nApril 5: Friday\n\nSo April 5 is Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But I need to confirm this. Alternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, April 1, 2022 is Monday. Then April 5 is Friday. But I need to make sure that this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can check another known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday? Wait, no, according to this calculation, April 1 is Monday. So that would mean that my previous assumption that April 1 was a Friday was wrong. So where did that come from? Maybe I confused the year. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is Tuesday, then February 1 is Friday. March 1 is Friday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. Wait, March has 31 days, so April 1 is 31 days after March 1. Wait, March 1 is Friday. Then March 1 + 31 days is April 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Friday + 3 days is Monday. So April 1 is Monday. Therefore, April 5 is Friday. So that seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But I need to make sure that this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday? Wait, no, according to this, it's Monday. Wait, maybe I can check the actual calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on calculations.

Then April 5 is Friday. Therefore, the answer is Friday. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for another date. For example, April 1, 2022 is Monday.

Wait, if June 2 is Thursday, then May 29 is the previous week. Let me count. June 2 is Thursday. Then May 29 is 2 days before June 1. Wait, June 1 is Wednesday. So May 29 is the day before June 1. So May 29 is Tuesday. Wait, but earlier I thought May 29 was Sunday. That's conflicting. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that July 4 is Monday. If July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Friday. So July 1 is Friday. Then June 30 is Thursday. Then June 23 is Thursday. June 16 is Thursday. June 9 is Thursday. June 2 is Thursday. Then May 29 is Wednesday. Because May 29 is the day before June 1. Wait, June 1 is Wednesday. So May 29 is Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting with previous statements. So if June 1 is Wednesday, then May 29 is Tuesday. Then May 29 is Tuesday. Then May 22 is Tuesday. May 15 is Tuesday. May 8 is Tuesday. May 1 is Tuesday. But that would mean May 1 is Tuesday. Then May 8 is Tuesday, May 15 is Tuesday, May 22 is Tuesday, May 29 is Tuesday. Then June 5 is Tuesday, June 12 is Tuesday, June 19 is Tuesday, June 26 is Tuesday. July 3 is Tuesday, July 4 is Wednesday. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier statement that July 4 is Monday. So this is a problem. Therefore, my previous assumption that June 1 is Wednesday must be wrong. Therefore, I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that May 13, 2022 is a Friday. But how can I confirm that? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2023, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I know that May 13, 2021 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make May 13, 2022 a Saturday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's true, then January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday, January 15 is Sunday, January 22 is Sunday, January 29 is Sunday, February 5 is Sunday, February 12 is Sunday, February 19 is Sunday, February 26 is Sunday, March 5 is Sunday, March 12 is Sunday, March 19 is Sunday, March 26 is Sunday, April 2 is Sunday, April 9 is Sunday, April 16 is Sunday, April 23 is Sunday, April 30 is Sunday. Then May 7 is Sunday. So May 7 is Sunday. Then May 13 is Saturday. Wait, that would make May 13 a Saturday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. So now I'm really confused. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to find another way. Let me think again. If January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then January 1 is Sunday. Then January 2 is Monday, and so on. Then January 31 is a Monday (since 31 days later). Wait, January 1 is Sunday, so January 8 is Sunday, January 15 is Sunday, January 22 is Sunday, January 29 is Sunday. Then February 5 is Sunday. February 12 is Sunday. February 19 is Sunday. February 26 is Sunday. March 5 is Sunday. March 12 is Sunday. March 19 is Sunday. March 26 is Sunday. April 2 is Sunday. April 9 is Sunday. April 16 is Sunday. April 23 is Sunday. April 30 is Sunday. Then May 7 is Sunday. May 14 is Sunday. So May 13 is Saturday. Therefore, May 13, 2022 is a Saturday. But earlier, when I thought that July 4 was Monday, that led to May 13 being Friday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if May 7 is Sunday, then May 13 is Saturday. So that would mean that May 13 is Saturday. But if July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Friday. So July 1 is Friday. Then June 24 is Friday. June 17 is Friday. June 10 is Friday. June 3 is Friday. May 27 is Friday. May 20 is Friday. May 13 is Friday. So that would mean May 13 is Friday. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that May 13 is Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is very confusing. I think I need to find a way to resolve this. Let me check the number of days between May 13, 2021 and May 13, 2022. Since 2022 is not a leap year, there are 365 days between them. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if May 13, 2021 was a Friday, then May 13, 2022 would be a Saturday. But if May 13, 2022 is a Saturday, then May 13, 2021 was a Friday. But I need to confirm what day May 13, 2021 was. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that May 13, 2020 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then 2020 to 2021 is 366 days (leap year), so 52 weeks and 2 days. So May 13, 2021 would be a Sunday. Then 2021 to 2022 is 365 days, so 52 weeks and 1 day. So May 13, 2022 would be a Monday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. So now I'm really confused. I think I need to find a reliable way to figure this out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2023. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I know that May 13, 2022 is a Friday. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2022. Wait, that's not helpful. I think I need to find a way to check. Let me try to use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. If that's correct, then May 13 is Saturday. But if July 4 is Monday, then May 13 is Friday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the number of days between January 1, 2022 (Sunday) and July 4, 2022. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so 28 days. March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 4 is 4 days. So total days from January 1 to July 4 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+31=151, 151+30=181, 181+4=185 days. So 185 days from January 1, 2022. Now, 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then 26 weeks later is also"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the fourth Tuesday in January 2022. State the amount as a number.

Let me start by recalling what day January 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think I remember that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I should check a calendar or use some method to verify. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know some other dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2021, was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding one day to January 1, 2021, would make January 1, 2022, a Sunday? Wait, that contradicts my initial thought. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, 2020 was a leap year, so 2020 had 366 days. So 2020 to 2021 would be 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 days. Therefore, January 1, 2021, would be two days after January 1, 2020. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look up the actual day. Alternatively, I can use an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check with another method. For example, I know that July 4, 2021, was a Monday. Then July 4, 2022, would be two days later because 2021 is not a leap year. So July 4, 2022, would be a Wednesday. Then, if I count back, let's see. Let's count the days from July 4, 2022, to January 1, 2022. Wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me assume that for now. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then the first Tuesday would be the 3rd (since Saturday is 1, Sunday 2, Monday 3, Tuesday 4? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then the days go like this: 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue). So the first Tuesday is the 4th. Then the second Tuesday would be the 11th, third is 18th, fourth is 25th. So the fourth Tuesday would be the 25th. But wait, January has 31 days, so 25th is valid. Therefore, the answer would be 25. But I need to make sure that my initial assumption about January 1, 2022, being a Saturday is correct. Let me check again. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So 2022 would be one day before that. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 would start on Saturday. Because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days later is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2022 starts on Saturday, then 2023 starts on Sunday. That makes sense. Therefore, January 1, 2022, was indeed a Saturday. Therefore, the first Tuesday is the 4th, then 11th, 18th, 25th. So the fourth Tuesday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer is 25. But wait, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that February 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 31 is a Monday (since 31 days later is 4 weeks and 3 days, so Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. So January 29 is Saturday. Then January 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday. So February 1 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So February 1 is Tuesday. Therefore, the first Tuesday in January is the 4th, then 11, 18, 25. So the fourth is 25. Therefore, the answer is 25.

Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I can check an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory or some other method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I know some other dates.

Then, if I can count the days from July to October, maybe I can figure out the days for October.\n\nBut maybe that's too complicated.

Wait, if that's the case, then October 31 is Monday. Then October 30 is Sunday, 29 is Saturday, 28 is Friday. So that would mean that the fourth Friday is the 28th.

Wait, so October 1 would be a Saturday? Because October 7 is Friday, so October 1 is 6 days before, which would be Saturday. So that matches. Therefore, October 1 is Saturday. Therefore, the first Friday is the 7th, then 14th, 21st, 28th. So the fourth Friday is the 28th. Therefore, the answer is 28. But wait, the question says \"fourth Friday of October 2022\". So that would be the 28th. But I need to make sure that there are four Fridays in October. Since October has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days. So there are 4 full weeks (28 days) and 3 extra days. So the first four Fridays would be on the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th. Then the next Friday would be the 35th, which doesn't exist.

So yes, that's correct. So the first Saturday is September 3. Then the next one would be September 10, which is outside the range.

But wait, maybe I'm missing another one. Let me count the days between August 28 and September 8.\n\nLet me calculate the total number of days between those dates. August 28 to August 31 is 4 days (including August 28). Then September 1 to September 8 is 8 days. So total days is 4 + 8 = 12 days.

The end date is Saturday, December 31, 2022. And we need to include both dates in the calculation.\n\nLet me list out the days between those two dates. December 30 is a Friday.

So, the only business day here is Friday, December 30. Wait, but the end date is Saturday, so does that include Saturday? The question says inclusive of both dates.

Let's think about the number of days between the start and end dates. Let me calculate the total days. November has 30 days, so from November 24 to November 30 is 7 days (including the 24th). Then December 1 to December 7 is 7 days. So total days from Nov 24 to Dec 7 inclusive is 7 + 7 = 14 days? Wait, wait.

Then December 1 is Thursday, 2 Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, 6 Tuesday, 7 Wednesday. So December 7 is a Wednesday. So the period includes from Thursday (Nov 24) to Wednesday (Dec 7). So the dates in between are 14 days. Now, how many Wednesdays are there in this period?\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\nNovember 24 is Thursday.

Let me think. November 24, 2022: I remember that November 25, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if November 24 is a Thursday, then November 25 is Friday. So November 30 would be 6 days later. Let me count: Nov 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed). Yes, that's correct. Then Dec 1 is Thu. Then Dec 7 is 7 days later, which would be Wednesday again. So yes, two Wednesdays. So the answer is 2.

First, I should figure out the dates involved and then check each Wednesday in that range.\n\nWait, the start date is April 24, 2022, which is a Sunday. The end date is May 18, 2022, which is a Wednesday. So the period includes from April 24 to May 18, inclusive. I need to count all the Wednesdays in this period.\n\nLet me start by checking the first day. April 24 is a Sunday. So the next day, April 25 is a Monday. Then April 26 is Tuesday, April 27 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday in the range is April 27, 2022. Then each subsequent Wednesday would be 7 days later. Let me list them out.\n\nApril 27 (Wed), May 4 (Wed), May 11 (Wed), May 18 (Wed). Wait, May 18 is the end date, which is a Wednesday. So that's included. So that's four Wednesdays. Let me check if there are any others. Let's count the days between April 24 and May 18.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (since April 24 is day 1, then April 25 is day 2, etc. up to April 30 is day 7). Then May 1 to May 18 is 18 days. So total days from April 24 to May 18 inclusive is 30 - 24 + 1 + 18? Wait, no. Wait, the total number of days between two dates inclusive can be calculated as (end date - start date) + 1.

The problem is: If the first day of the year was a Tuesday, what day of the week will March 26 be? I need to figure out the day of the week for March 26th, given that January 1st is a Tuesday. \n\nFirst, I should recall how many days are in each month. Let me think. January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29, depending on whether it's a leap year. But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about a leap year. Hmm. Since the first day of the year is Tuesday, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Wait, but maybe the question is assuming a non-leap year? Or maybe it's not important? Wait, the problem is in the context of a specific year, but since it's not given, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. If it's a leap year, February would have 29 days, which would affect the total days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check if the year is a leap year. Wait, but how can I know? The problem says \"the first day of the year was a Tuesday\"\u2014so maybe the year is not a leap year? Or maybe it's possible that the year is a leap year. Wait, but the problem is probably expecting a standard answer, so maybe it's a non-leap year. Let me check. For example, if the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. Wait, but that's not possible. For example, if the year is a leap year, then the number of days from January 1st to March 26th would be different. So maybe the problem is assuming a non-leap year. Let me check the months. Let's proceed with non-leap year first.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. Then February has 28 days. March has 31 days. So, to find the day of the week for March 26th, I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 26th, then find the remainder when divided by 7, and add that to Tuesday.\n\nSo, first, let's calculate the total days. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. So adding that, 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 26th is 26 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 26th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 26 (March) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 26 is 85 days. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 31st is day 31. Then February 1st is day 32, and so on. So the total days from January 1st to March 26th is 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But wait, if I count from day 1 (Jan 1) to day 85, then March 26th is day 85. But since the first day is Tuesday, then day 1 is Tuesday. Then day 85 is how many days later?\n\nTo find the day of the week, we can compute 85 - 1 = 84 days later. Because day 1 is Tuesday, so day 2 is 1 day later, etc. So 84 days later. Then 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. So adding 12 weeks to Tuesday would still be Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean March 26th is also a Tuesday? But that seems odd. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 8th is also Tuesday (since 7 days later). So each week cycles every 7 days. So if the total number of days from January 1 to March 26 is 85 days, then the day of the week would be (85 - 1) mod 7 days after Tuesday. Wait, because day 1 is Tuesday, so day 1 + n days is (Tuesday + n days). So the number of days between day 1 and day 85 is 84 days. So 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. So 84 days later is the same day of the week. Therefore, March 26th would be Tuesday. But that seems like maybe the answer is Tuesday. But wait, that seems too easy. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. So adding 28 days, that's 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 26th is 26 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. So that's correct. So 85 days. So day 85 is 84 days after day 1. 84 divided by 7 is 12. So 12 weeks. So same day. So Tuesday. But that seems like maybe the answer is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1st as Tuesday. Then January 8th is Tuesday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Wait, so March 26th would be 26th of March. Let's see. Let's count the number of days from January 1 to March 26. Let's check the dates. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is day 1. Then February 1 is day 32. March 1 is day 32 + 28 = day 60 (since February has 28 days). Then March 26 is 26 days after March 1. So March 1 is day 60. So March 26 is day 60 + 25 = day 85. So that's correct. So day 85. So 85 days from January 1. So 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 1 day. Wait, wait, 7*12 is 84. So 85 is 84 +1. So 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day. So if day 1 is Tuesday, then day 85 is 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. Wait, this contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, what's the problem here?\n\nWait, earlier I thought that 84 days later is the same day, but here, 85 days from day 1 is 84 days later. Wait, no. Wait, if day 1 is Tuesday, then day 1 + 1 day is day 2, which is Wednesday. So day 1 + 84 days is day 85. So 84 days later. So 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks. So 84 days later is same day. So day 85 is Tuesday. But according to the other approach, March 26 is day 85. But according to the step-by-step counting, March 26 is day 85. But when I thought of 85 days from day 1, that's 84 days later. So that would be same day. But when I thought of 85 days from day 1, that's 84 days later. So that's same day. But then why when I thought of March 26 as day 60 + 25 = day 85, and then 85 days from day 1 is 84 days later. So that would be Tuesday. But then why when I thought of the step-by-step counting, I thought that March 26 is 12 weeks and 1 day? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in that step. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if day 1 is Tuesday, then day 1 + 7 days is day 8, which is Tuesday again. So day 8 is Tuesday. Then day 15, 22, 29, etc. So day 29 is Tuesday. Then day 29 + 7 = day 36 (February 5th?), wait, maybe I need to check the actual dates. Let me try to count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday (day 1)\nJanuary 8: Tuesday (day 8)\nJanuary 15: Tuesday (day 15)\nJanuary 22: Tuesday (day 22)\nJanuary 29: Tuesday (day 29)\nFebruary 5: Tuesday (day 36)\nFebruary 12: Tuesday (day 43)\nFebruary 19: Tuesday (day 50)\nFebruary 26: Tuesday (day 57)\nMarch 5: Tuesday (day 64)\nMarch 12: Tuesday (day 71)\nMarch 19: Tuesday (day 78)\nMarch 26: Tuesday (day 85)\n\nAh! So according to this, March 26 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So the answer is Tuesday. But earlier when I thought of 85 days from day 1, I thought that 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day, but that's wrong. Because 7*12 is 84, so 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day. But that would mean that day 85 is 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. But according to the step-by-step counting, it's Tuesday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, the confusion is between the number of days from day 1 to day 85. If day 1 is Tuesday, then day 1 + 1 day is day 2 (Wednesday). So the number of days between day 1 and day 85 is 84 days. So 84 days later. So 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks. So 84 days later is same day. Therefore, day 85 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So the mistake was in the previous thought where I thought that 85 days from day 1 is 84 days later. But that's correct. So 85 days from day 1 is day 85, which is 84 days after day 1. So that's 12 weeks, same day. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But why when I thought of 85 days as 12 weeks and 1 day, that was wrong? Because 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day, but that would be if you start counting from day 1 as day 0. Wait, maybe I confused the way of counting. Let me think again. If day 1 is Tuesday, then day 1 + 7 days is day 8, which is Tuesday. So day 8 is 7 days after day 1. So day 8 is Tuesday. So day 1 + 7 days = day 8. So day 1 + 84 days is day 85. Which is 12 weeks later. So day 85 is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. So the correct answer is Tuesday. But why did I think earlier that 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day? Because 85 divided by 7 is 12.142... So 12*7 is 84, so 85 is 84 +1. So that would be 12 weeks and 1 day. But that's the number of days from day 1 to day 85. Wait, but if day 1 is Tuesday, then day 85 is 84 days later. So 84 days is 12 weeks. So day 85 is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. So the correct answer is Tuesday. But maybe I need to check with another method. Let me check the actual dates. For example, if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 2 is Wednesday, etc. Let's check March 26. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Tuesday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 is 3 days after Tuesday, which is Friday. Wait, that's a different approach. So if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 + 31 days is February 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 is Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. Then February has 28 days. So March 1 is 28 days after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also Friday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 26 is 25 days after March 1. 25 days is 3 weeks and 4 days. So March 1 is Friday, adding 3 weeks (21 days) is still Friday. Then 4 days more: Friday + 4 days is Tuesday. So March 26 is Tuesday. So that's the same answer. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. So the correct answer is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [124, "How many Wednesdays are there from Friday, December 2, 2022 to Wednesday, December 7, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

So I need to count all the Wednesdays between these two dates, including both the start and end dates.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the days of the week for each date in this range. Let me start by noting the starting date: Friday, December 2, 2022. Then the next day is Saturday, December 3, 2022. Then Sunday, December 4. Then Monday, December 5. Then Tuesday, December 6. And the next day is Wednesday, December 7. So the end date is Wednesday, December 7.\n\nSo the dates in question are from the 2nd (Friday) to the 7th (Wednesday). Let me list each day and check if it's a Wednesday.\n\nStarting with December 2: Friday. Not a Wednesday. Then December 3: Saturday. No. December 4: Sunday. No. December 5: Monday. No. December 6: Tuesday. No. December 7: Wednesday. Yes. So that's one Wednesday. Wait, but wait, is there another one? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the start date is Friday the 2nd. So the first Wednesday after that would be the 7th? Let me count the days between them. From Friday the 2nd to the next Wednesday. Let's see: Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4), Monday (5), Tuesday (6), Wednesday (7). So yes, the 7th is the first Wednesday in this period. But the start date is the 2nd, which is a Friday. So the only Wednesday in this range is the 7th. But wait, the end date is inclusive. So the 7th is included. So that's one Wednesday. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of days between the two dates and see how many weeks there are. Let's see. From December 2 to December 7 is 6 days. Because 7 minus 2 is 5 days, but since it's inclusive, it's 6 days total. Wait, no. Wait, if you have two dates, the number of days between them inclusive is (end date - start date + 1). So December 2 to December 7 is 7 - 2 + 1 = 6 days. So there are 6 days in total. Now, since the start date is a Friday, the days would be:\n\nDay 1: Friday (2nd)\n\nDay 2: Saturday (3rd)\n\nDay 3: Sunday (4th)\n\nDay 4: Monday (5th)\n\nDay 5: Tuesday (6th)\n\nDay 6: Wednesday (7th)\n\nSo in those 6 days, only the 6th day is a Wednesday. Therefore, the count is 1. So the answer should be 1. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another way. Let me check what day of the week December 7, 2022, was. Wait, the user said that the end date is Wednesday, December 7. So that's correct. So the only Wednesday in that period is the 7th. Therefore, the answer is 1. But wait, maybe I should check if there's another Wednesday in between. For example, if the start date was a Wednesday, then there would be two. But since the start date is Friday, the next Wednesday is the 7th. So yes, only one.

The problem is: If today is Thursday, February 3, 2022, what day of the week will it be in 84 days? I need to find the weekday name in full.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 84 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 84 divided by 7 is exactly 12. So that means 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. Since 12 weeks is 84 days, that would mean that adding 84 days to Thursday would still be Thursday, right? Because each week cycles every 7 days. So adding 7 days would be the same day, so 12 times that would be the same day. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, the original date is February 3, 2022. Let me think. 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're adding 84 days, maybe I need to check if the date crosses into different months and if there are any months with 31 days or something. But wait, the problem is not asking for the actual date, just the day of the week. So maybe the number of days is exactly 12 weeks, so the day of the week would be the same. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this. Let me try adding 7 days to the original date. February 3 plus 7 days is February 10, which is also a Thursday. Then adding another 7 days would be February 17, Thursday again. So each week, it's the same day. So 12 weeks later would be 84 days, so the same day. Therefore, the answer should be Thursday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose I have 84 days. Let me divide 84 by 7. 7 times 12 is 84. So that's exactly 12 weeks. So no remainder. Therefore, the day of the week is the same. So the answer is Thursday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by counting the days step by step. Let's see. Let's take the original date as Thursday, February 3, 2022. Let's add 84 days. Let me break it down into months. \n\nFebruary has 28 days in 2022. So from February 3 to February 28 is 25 days (since 28 - 3 = 25, but including the start day? Wait, no. If I start on February 3, then adding 25 days would take me to February 28. Wait, 3 + 25 days is 28th. So that's 25 days. Then March has 31 days. April has 30, May 31, etc. But maybe this is getting complicated. But since the total is 84 days, maybe I can check if the total days are correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 84 divided by 7 is 12. So regardless of the actual dates, the day of the week would be the same. So even if the date is in a different month, the day of the week would be the same. So the answer is Thursday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's take the original date, add 84 days, and see. Let me try to calculate the actual date. \n\nStarting from February 3, 2022. Let's add 84 days. \n\nFirst, February has 28 days. So from February 3 to February 28 is 25 days (since 28 - 3 = 25, but if you include the start day, it's 25 days later? Wait, no. If today is February 3, then adding 1 day is February 4. So adding 25 days would be February 28. So that's 25 days. Then March has 31 days. So adding 31 days would take us to April 1. Wait, but 25 + 31 = 56 days. Then April has 30 days. So adding 30 days would take us to May 1. 56 + 30 = 86 days. Wait, but 84 days is 2 days less than 86. So 84 days would be May 1 minus 2 days, which is April 30. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nWait, starting from February 3, 2022. Let's add 25 days to get to February 28. Then March has 31 days. So adding 31 days would take us to March 31 (since 25 + 31 = 56 days). Then April has 30 days. So adding 30 days would take us to May 1 (56 + 30 = 86 days). But 84 days is 2 days before May 1. So that would be April 30. Wait, but April 30 is 84 days after February 3? Let me check. \n\nWait, February 3 + 25 days is February 28. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days would be March 31 (25 + 31 = 56 days). Then adding 28 days (since 84 - 56 = 28) would take us to April 28 (since March 31 + 28 days is April 28). Wait, but April has 30 days. So 28 days after March 31 is April 28. So that's 56 + 28 = 84 days. So the date would be April 28, 2022. \n\nNow, what day of the week is April 28, 2022? Well, if the original date is February 3, 2022, which is a Thursday. Let me check if that's correct. Wait, I need to confirm that. Wait, the problem says that today is Thursday, February 3, 2022. So that's given. So if I add 84 days, which is 12 weeks, then the day should be Thursday. But if I check the actual date, April 28, 2022, what day was that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. Let me think. Let's check the day of the week for April 28, 2022. Let's see. For example, if I know that February 3 is Thursday, then adding 84 days. But maybe I can check the actual day. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. So regardless of the actual date, adding 12 weeks would be the same day. Therefore, the answer is Thursday. \n\nBut maybe I should check with another approach. Let's take the original date, February 3, 2022. Let's add 7 days: February 10, 2022. That's a Thursday. Then 14 days later is February 17, Thursday. 21 days: February 24, Thursday. 28 days: March 3, Thursday. 35 days: March 10, Thursday. 42 days: March 17, Thursday. 49 days: March 24, Thursday. 56 days: March 31, Thursday. 63 days: April 7, Thursday. 70 days: April 14, Thursday. 77 days: April 21, Thursday. 84 days: April 28, Thursday. \n\nSo that's 12 weeks.

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each day.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. October 3, 2022 is a Monday. Then October 4 is Tuesday, 5 is Wednesday, 6 is Thursday, 7 is Friday. October 8 is Saturday, 9 is Sunday. Then October 10 is Monday again. So the week cycles every 7 days.\n\nSo from October 3 (Monday) to October 25 (Tuesday). Let me calculate the total days first. The difference between October 25 and October 3 is 22 days (since 25-3=22). But since both dates are inclusive, the total days would be 22 + 1 = 23 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have two dates, the number of days between them inclusive is (end date - start date) + 1. So October 3 to October 4 is 2 days (3 and 4).

Another 7 days.\n\nWeek 4: 24 (Mon), 25 (Tue). That's 2 days.\n\nSo total days: 7 + 7 + 7 + 2 = 23 days. Correct.\n\nNow, weekends are Saturday and Sunday. Let's count how many Saturdays and Sundays are in this period.\n\nLooking at the weeks:\n\nWeek 1: Sat (8) and Sun (9) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 2: Sat (15) and Sun (16) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 3: Sat (22) and Sun (23) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 4: 24 is Monday, 25 is Tuesday. No weekends here.\n\nSo total weekends: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 days.\n\nTherefore, business days would be total days (23) minus weekends (6) = 17 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me list each day from 3 to 25 and count the business days.\n\nStarting with October 3 (Mon) as day 1. Then:\n\n3: Mon (business)\n4: Tue (business)\n5: Wed (business)\n6: Thu (business)\n7: Fri (business)\n8: Sat (non)\n9: Sun (non)\n10: Mon (business)\n11: Tue (business)\n12: Wed (business)\n13: Thu (business)\n14: Fri (business)\n15: Sat (non)\n16: Sun (non)\n17: Mon (business)\n18: Tue (business)\n19: Wed (business)\n20: Thu (business)\n21: Fri (business)\n22: Sat (non)\n23: Sun (non)\n24: Mon (business)\n25: Tue (business)\n\nNow count the business days. Let's count each line:\n\nMon (3), Tue (4), Wed (5), Thu (6), Fri (7) \u2192 5 days.\n\nThen next week: Mon (10), Tue (11), Wed (12), Thu (13), Fri (14) \u2192 5 days.\n\nNext week: Mon (17), Tue (18), Wed (19), Thu (20), Fri (21) \u2192 5 days.\n\nThen the last two days: Mon (24), Tue (25) \u2192 2 days.\n\nTotal: 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 17 days. So that's 17 business days. So the answer should be 17.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate it using another method. Let's see. The total days are 23. The number of weekends is 6. So 23-6=17. That matches. So that's correct.\n\nAnother way: Let's calculate the number of weeks and days. From October 3 to October 25 is 22 days difference. So 22 days is 3 weeks (21 days) and 1 day. But since the start is Monday, adding 3 weeks would take us to October 24 (since 3 weeks from October 3 is October 10, 17, 24). Then October 25 is one day after that. So the total days are 3 weeks (21 days) plus 2 days (October 24 and 25). But that's not directly helpful. But maybe the number of weekends in 3 weeks is 3*2=6 days. Then the remaining 2 days (October 24 and 25) are both business days. So total weekends are 6, so business days are 23-6=17. Same answer.\n\nSo I think 17 is correct. Therefore, the answer is 17.\n</think>", "17"], [124, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Thursday, February 10, 2022 to Saturday, March 12, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Provide the count as a number.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many business days there are from Thursday, February 10, 2022, to Saturday, March 12, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates involved. The start date is February 10, 2022, which is a Thursday. The end date is March 12, 2022, which is a Saturday. The question says inclusive of both dates, so both the start and end dates are counted.\n\nI need to count all the days from February 10 to March 12, then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of weeks and then add the remaining days. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe breaking it down into months would help. February 2022 has 28 days, right? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So from February 10 to February 28, that's 28 - 10 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to calculate the days in February first.\n\nWait, let's start by calculating the total number of days from February 10 to March 12 inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom February 10 to February 28: February 10 is the first day. February has 28 days, so from the 10th to the 28th inclusive is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Wait, 28 minus 10 is 18, plus 1 is 19. So that's 19 days in February.\n\nThen March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total days from February 10 to March 12 inclusive is 19 + 12 = 31 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, if February 10 is day 1, then February 11 is day 2, ..., February 28 is day 19. Then March 1 is day 20, March 2 is 21, ..., March 12 is day 31. So total 31 days. That seems right.\n\nNow, out of these 31 days, how many are weekends? Let's find the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nFirst, let's check the starting date: February 10 is a Thursday. So the next day, February 11 is Friday, 12 is Saturday, 13 is Sunday. Then February 14 is Monday, and so on.\n\nSo in February, starting from February 10 (Thursday), the weekends would be:\n\nFebruary 12 (Saturday), 13 (Sunday), then 19 (Saturday), 20 (Sunday), 26 (Saturday), 27 (Sunday). Wait, let me check each week.\n\nWait, February 10 is Thursday. So the first week in February would have:\n\nWeek 1: Feb 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun). So that's 4 days. Then the next week starts on Feb 14 (Mon) to Feb 18 (Fri). Then next week is Feb 19 (Sat) to Feb 23 (Wed). Wait, but February has 28 days. Let me list all the weekends in February.\n\nSo starting from Feb 10 (Thu):\n\nWeek 1: Sat (12), Sun (13)\n\nWeek 2: Sat (19), Sun (20)\n\nWeek 3: Sat (26), Sun (27)\n\nThen the next week would be Sat (March 4) and Sun (March 5), but March is after the end date of March 12. So in February, the weekends are 12,13,19,20,26,27. That's 6 days.\n\nThen in March, the weekends would be March 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun), 11 (Sat), 12 (Sun). Wait, but the end date is March 12, which is a Saturday. Wait, March 12 is Saturday. So March 12 is included. So in March, the weekends would be March 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun), 11 (Sat), 12 (Sun). But wait, March 12 is the end date. So that's 4 days in March.\n\nWait, but let me check the dates again. Let's check March 1, 2022. Since February 28 is a Monday (since February 10 is Thursday, adding 18 days: 18 days later. 18 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 4 days. So Thursday + 4 days is Monday. So February 28 is a Monday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. So March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 2 is Wednesday, March 3 is Thursday, March 4 is Friday, March 5 is Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if March 1 is Tuesday, then March 4 is Friday. Then March 5 is Saturday. So March 5 is Saturday. Then March 6 is Sunday. Then March 7 is Monday. Then March 11 is Friday, March 12 is Saturday. Wait, so March 12 is Saturday. So in March, the weekends would be March 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun). But since our end date is March 12, which is Saturday, so March 5, 6, and 12 are weekends. Wait, March 12 is included. So that's three weekends in March? Wait, March 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat). Wait, March 12 is Saturday. So that's three days. Wait, but March 13 would be Sunday, but that's beyond the end date. So in March, the weekends are March 5, 6, and 12. So that's three days.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought March 11 was Friday, March 12 Saturday. So March 5 is Saturday, March 6 Sunday, March 12 Saturday. So that's three days. So total weekends in the entire period would be 6 (February) + 3 (March) = 9 days. Therefore, total business days would be 31 total days minus 9 weekends = 22 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nFirst, let's check the weekends in February. Starting from Feb 10 (Thursday). The first weekend is Feb 12 (Saturday) and 13 (Sunday). Then next weekend is Feb 19 (Saturday) and 20 (Sunday). Then next is Feb 26 (Saturday) and 27 (Sunday). So that's 6 days. Then in March, the first weekend is March 5 (Saturday) and 6 (Sunday). Then March 12 is Saturday. So that's two more weekends (March 5,6) and March 12. Wait, March 12 is Saturday. So that's three days. So total weekends are 6 + 3 = 9. So 31 total days minus 9 weekends is 22 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check the dates again. Let's list all the dates from Feb 10 to March 12 and count the weekends.\n\nStarting with Feb 10 (Thu) to March 12 (Sat). Let's list each day and check if it's a weekend.\n\nBut that might take time, but maybe necessary to verify.\n\nFirst, February 10 is Thursday. So:\n\nFeb 10: Thu (business)\nFeb 11: Fri (business)\nFeb 12: Sat (weekend)\nFeb 13: Sun (weekend)\nFeb 14: Mon (business)\nFeb 15: Tue (business)\nFeb 16: Wed (business)\nFeb 17: Thu (business)\nFeb 18: Fri (business)\nFeb 19: Sat (weekend)\nFeb 20: Sun (weekend)\nFeb 21: Mon (business)\nFeb 22: Tue (business)\nFeb 23: Wed (business)\nFeb 24: Thu (business)\nFeb 25: Fri (business)\nFeb 26: Sat (weekend)\nFeb 27: Sun (weekend)\nFeb 28: Mon (business)\nMarch 1: Tue (business)\nMarch 2: Wed (business)\nMarch 3: Thu (business)\nMarch 4: Fri (business)\nMarch 5: Sat (weekend)\nMarch 6: Sun (weekend)\nMarch 7: Mon (business)\nMarch 8: Tue (business)\nMarch 9: Wed (business)\nMarch 10: Thu (business)\nMarch 11: Fri (business)\nMarch 12: Sat (weekend)\n\nNow, let's count the weekends. The weekends are:\n\nFeb 12, 13, 19, 20, 26, 27, 5, 6, 12. Wait, that's 9 days. So that's correct. So 9 weekends. So total days is 31, so 31 - 9 = 22 business days.\n\nBut wait, the end date is March 12, which is a Saturday. So that's included. So the count is correct. So the answer should be 22.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by counting the business days directly. Let's see.\n\nFrom Feb 10 (Thu) to March 12 (Sat). Let's count the business days.\n\nFirst, in February:\n\nFrom Feb 10 (Thu) to Feb 28 (Mon). Let's count the business days here.\n\nFeb 10 (Thu) to Feb 13 (Sun) is 4 days, but weekends are 12 and 13. So business days from 10 to 13: 10,11,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28. Wait, maybe this approach is confusing. Alternatively, since we already listed all the days and found 9 weekends, maybe that's the easiest way.\n\nBut according to the list above, the weekends are 9 days. So 31 total days minus 9 is 22. So the answer is 22.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's calculate the number of weeks between the dates. From Feb 10 to March 12 is 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, which would have 4*5=20 business days. Then the remaining 3 days are Feb 28 (Mon), March 1 (Tue), March 2 (Wed). All business days. So 20 + 3 = 23. Wait, but that contradicts the previous answer of 22. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this method is wrong because the remaining 3 days may include weekends. Wait, but according to the previous list, the total days are 31. So 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. But the 3 days would be Feb 28 (Mon), March 1 (Tue), March 2 (Wed). All business days. So that would be 20 + 3 = 23. But according to the previous count, it's 22. So there's a discrepancy here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the total days. Let me check again. How many days from Feb 10 to March 12 inclusive?\n\nLet me calculate the number of days between those dates. Let's use the formula: (end date - start date) + 1.\n\nBut I need to check the actual number of days. Let's check the dates.\n\nFebruary 10 to February 28 is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total 19 + 12 = 31 days. That's correct. So 31 days.\n\nBut according to the weeks method, 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. But 28 + 3 = 31. So that's correct. But why the discrepancy in the business days?\n\nBecause the 4 weeks would have 4*5=20 business days. Then the remaining 3 days (Feb 28, March 1, March 2) are all business days. So 20 + 3 = 23. But according to the previous count, there are 9 weekends, so 31-9=22. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a mistake here. Because the 4 weeks would be 28 days, but the start date is Thursday, Feb 10. So the first week (Feb 10-16) would be 7 days. Then the next week (Feb 17-23), then Feb 24-30 (but February only has 28 days). Wait, maybe the weeks are not aligned properly. Let me think again.\n\nIf the start date is Thursday, Feb 10, then the first week (Feb 10-16) includes 7 days. Then the next week is Feb 17-23 (7 days). Then the next week is Feb 24-30 (but February only has 28 days, so Feb 24-28 is 5 days). Then March 1-3 is 3 days. So total days would be 7 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 22 days? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the total days from Feb 10 to March 12 is 31 days. So maybe the weeks method is not the best here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that 4 weeks is 28 days. But if the start date is Thursday, then the first week (Feb 10-16) is 7 days. Then the next week (Feb 17-23) is 7 days. Then the next week (Feb 24-30) is 7 days, but February only has 28 days. So Feb 24-28 is 5 days. Then March 1-3 is 3 days. So total days would be 7 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 22 days? Wait, that's not adding up. Wait, 7+7 is 14, plus 5 is 19, plus 3 is 22. But that's only 22 days, but we know there are 31 days. So this approach is wrong. Therefore, the weeks method is not being applied correctly here.\n\nSo the correct way is to count the total days as 31, and then subtract the weekends. According to the list of days, there are 9 weekends. So 31-9=22. But according to the other approach, the weeks method, I thought there was a discrepancy. But maybe I made a mistake in that approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the list of weekends. Let me check again the list of weekends:\n\nFrom the list above, the weekends are:\n\nFeb 12, 13 (2 days)\n\nFeb 19, 20 (2 days)\n\nFeb 26, 27 (2 days)\n\nMarch 5, 6 (2 days)\n\nMarch 12 (1 day)\n\nTotal: 2+2+2+2+1=9 days. So that's correct. So 9 weekends. So 31-9=22 business days. Therefore, the answer is 22.\n\nBut why does the other approach give 23? Because that approach was wrong. Because when I said 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days, but that's not correct. Because the 4 weeks would be 28 days, but the start date is Thursday, so the first week is 7 days (Thu to next Wed), but the next weeks would be different. However, the problem is that the 3 days after 28 days (Feb 28) would be March 1, 2, 3. But in reality, the total days from Feb 10 to March 12 is 31 days. So 28 days would be from Feb 10 to Feb 27 (inclusive?), but that's not correct. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the weeks method. Let me try again. Let's count the number of business days by counting the number of weeks and the remaining days.\n\nFrom Feb 10 (Thursday) to March 12 (Saturday). Let's see how many full weeks there are and the remaining days.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of days between the two dates. As established, 31 days.\n\nNow, 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days. So the first 28 days would be 4 weeks. Then the remaining 3 days are March 1, 2, 3. But wait, the start date is Feb 10. So adding 28 days to Feb 10 would be Feb 28 (since 28 days later is Feb 28). Then March 1, 2, 3 are the next three days. But the end date is March 12. So the remaining days after 28 days (Feb 28) are March 1 to March 12, which is"], [124, "Name the day of the week for 01/17/2022. Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week January 17, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because 2020 was a leap year, so January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2021 would be 365 days later, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding one day to Wednesday would make 2021 start on a Thursday? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 2020 was a leap year, so February had 29 days. So 2020 started on a Wednesday. Then 2021 would be 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2020 started on a Wednesday, then 2021 would start on a Thursday. Then 2022 would be 365 days after that, which is another 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on a Friday? Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here. Alternatively, maybe I should check an actual calendar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me think. If I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then I can count forward. Let's see. January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is also Saturday, 15th, 22nd, etc. So January 17th would be 16 days after January 1. Wait, January 1 is day 1. So January 17 is day 17. Let me count the days from January 1 to January 17. Since each week has 7 days, 17 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 3 days. So if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 2 weeks (14 days) would still be Saturday. Then adding 3 days would be Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. Wait, that would make January 17 a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a known reference. Wait, I can't access the internet, but maybe I can recall that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me think of another way. For example, if I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Wait, no, 2020 started on a Wednesday. Then 2021 started on a Thursday. So January 1, 2021 was a Friday? Wait, no. Wait, 2020 started on a Wednesday. Then 2021 would start on a Thursday. So January 1, 2021 was a Thursday. Then 2022 would start on a Friday. Wait, that would mean that January 1, 2022 was a Friday. But that contradicts my previous thought. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual days. Let me think of some other dates. For example, I know that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Wait, if that's the case, then July 4, 2021 is Monday. Then July 4, 2022 would be 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So July 4, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that December 25, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, if that's true, then December 25, 2021 is Saturday. Then December 25, 2022 would be 365 days later, which is 52 weeks and 1 day, so Sunday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me try to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then 2022 would be one year before that. So 2022 started on a Saturday. Because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days later is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 started on a Sunday, then 2022 started on a Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So that would mean that January 17, 2022 is 16 days later. Wait, January 1 is day 1. So January 17 is day 17. 17 - 1 = 16 days after January 1. 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday? Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1 is Saturday, then adding 7 days is January 8 (Saturday), 15 (Saturday), 22 (Saturday). So January 15 is Saturday. Then January 16 is Sunday, January 17 is Monday. So that would make January 17, 2022 a Monday. But earlier when I thought of adding 16 days, I thought that 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days, so Saturday + 2 days is Monday. So that would be correct. So that would mean that the answer is Monday. But I need to make sure that January 1, 2022 was indeed a Saturday. Because if that's wrong, then the answer would be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that February 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday, January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, January 4 is Tuesday. Then January 4 is Tuesday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Tuesday would be Friday. But that contradicts the idea that February 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, that can't be right. So maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Therefore, I need to correct that.\n\nWait, if February 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then January 1 would be 31 days before that. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So if February 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 would be Tuesday minus 3 days, which is Saturday. Wait, that would mean that January 1 is Saturday. But according to that, February 1 is Tuesday. But if January 1 is Saturday, then January 1 + 31 days is February 1. Let me check that. January has 31 days. So January 1 + 31 days is February 1. So if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 31 days would be 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So that would make February 1 a Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is correct. Therefore, January 17 is 16 days after January 1. 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Therefore, January 17, 2022 was a Monday. But wait, I thought earlier that January 15 was Saturday, so 16th is Sunday, 17th is Monday. That's correct. So the answer should be Monday.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I'm not making any mistakes here. Let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check another date. For example, January 24, 2022 would be 23 days after January 1. 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Wait, but January 24 is 23 days after January 1. Wait, January 1 is day 1, so January 24 is day 24. 24 - 1 = 23 days. So 23 days is 3 weeks (21 days) and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. So January 24 is Monday. Then January 25 is Tuesday, 26 is Wednesday, 27 is Thursday, 28 is Friday, 29 is Saturday, 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday. Wait, but that would mean that January 31 is Monday. But that's not possible because January 1 is Saturday, so January 8 is Saturday, 15 is Saturday, 22 is Saturday, 29 is Saturday. So January 29 is Saturday, 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday. So that's correct. Therefore, January 31 is Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. So that's correct.

First, I should figure out what day of the week each of these dates falls on. Let me start by checking the dates.\n\nWait, I remember that December 26, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, maybe I should check a calendar or use some method to verify. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know certain dates. For example, December 26, 2022: if I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday, then December 26 would be a Monday. Wait, but I need to be sure. Let me think. Let's take a known date. For example, December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, maybe I should use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that December 26, 2022 is a Monday. Let me check that. Let me think of some other dates. For example, December 26, 2022. If I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday, then December 26 would be a Monday. But how do I know that? Maybe I can check by using the fact that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to rely on my memory or logical calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Wait, if that's true, then December 1 is Thursday. Then December 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday, 5 is Monday, 6 is Tuesday, 7 is Wednesday, 8 is Thursday. So December 8 is Thursday. Then adding 7 days each week. So December 15 is Thursday, 22 is Thursday, 29 is Thursday. Wait, but December 29 would be a Thursday. Then December 30 would be Friday. So if that's the case, then the dates from December 26 to December 30 would be:\n\nDecember 26: Monday\n\nDecember 27: Tuesday\n\nDecember 28: Wednesday\n\nDecember 29: Thursday\n\nDecember 30: Friday\n\nSo in that case, between December 26 and 30 inclusive, there is one Thursday, which is December 29. Therefore, the answer would be 1. But wait, let me check again. Wait, if December 26 is Monday, then the next Thursday would be December 29. So that's one occurrence. So the total is 1. But I need to make sure that my initial assumption that December 26 is a Monday is correct. Because if that's wrong, then the answer would be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's think about the week of December 26. Let's say that December 26 is Monday. Then the next day is Tuesday (27), Wednesday (28), Thursday (29), Friday (30). So that's correct. So from 26 to 30, the Thursdays are only on the 29th. So the answer is 1. But maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the day of the week for December 26, 2022. Let me try to calculate it using some method. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So December 31, 2022 is the day before that. So December 31, 2022 is a Saturday. Then December 30 is Friday, December 29 is Thursday, December 28 is Wednesday, December 27 is Tuesday, December 26 is Monday. So that's correct. Therefore, December 26 is a Monday. Therefore, the dates from 26 to 30 include one Thursday on the 29th. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. And I need to answer with the complete weekday name, like Monday, Tuesday, etc. Alright, so I need to figure out what day of the week April 3rd falls on if January 1st is a Wednesday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st.\" So maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year unless specified otherwise? Or maybe the problem is designed so that it doesn't matter? Wait, but if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't mention it, maybe I should assume it's a common year with 28 days in February. But I need to check if that's correct. Wait, but maybe the problem is designed in a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Or maybe the problem is in a specific year. Wait, but the problem is general. Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check. Let me think. If January 1 is Wednesday, then February 1 would be 31 days later. Since 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Wednesday would make February 1st a Saturday. Then March 1st would be 28 days later (if non-leap year) which is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1st would be the same day as February 1st, which is Saturday. Wait, no. Wait, if February has 28 days, then March 1st is 28 days after February 1st. 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks, so same day. So March 1st would be Saturday. Then April 1st would be 31 days after March 1st. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday would be Tuesday. So April 1st is Tuesday. Then April 3rd would be two days after that, so Thursday. Wait, but wait, let me check again. Let me go step by step.\n\nJanuary 1 is Wednesday. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is day 0 (Wednesday). Then January 8 is also Wednesday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Thursday, January 31 is Friday. So February 1 is Saturday. Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year). So February 28 is the last day of February. Then March 1 is Saturday. March has 31 days. So March 1 is Saturday. March 8, 15, 22, 29 are also Saturdays. Then March 30 is Friday, March 31 is Saturday. Then April 1 is Sunday? Wait, wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, if March 1 is Saturday, then March 1 is Saturday. Then March 1 + 7 days is March 8, which is Saturday. Then March 15, 22, 29. Then March 29 is Saturday. March 30 is Sunday, March 31 is Monday. Then April 1 is Tuesday. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, so earlier I thought that April 1 would be Tuesday. But in this case, March 1 is Saturday, so March 31 is Monday. Then April 1 is Tuesday. So April 3 would be Thursday. But earlier when I thought of adding 3 days to Saturday (February 1) to get March 1, that was correct. Wait, but then March 1 is Saturday. Then March 1 + 28 days is March 29, which is Saturday again. Then March 30 is Sunday, March 31 is Monday. So April 1 is Tuesday. Then April 3 is Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday. So the answer would be Thursday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let me count the days from January 1 to April 3. Let's do that. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March has 31 days. So up to March 31, that's 31 + 28 + 31 = 90 days. Then April 3 is 3 days after March 31. So total days from January 1 to April 3 is 90 + 3 = 93 days. Wait, but January 1 is day 0. So day 1 is January 2, etc. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the number of days between January 1 and April 3. Let me think. If January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is 3 + 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, the total days from January 1 to April 3 is (31 days in January) + (28 days in February) + (31 days in March) + 3 days in April. Wait, but that would be 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. But since January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is 93 days later. So 93 days after Wednesday. Now, since 7 days a week, 93 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 2 days. So 13 weeks is 91 days, so 93 days is 13 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Wednesday would be Friday. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nWait, this is a problem. So according to this calculation, 93 days later is 2 days after Wednesday, which is Friday. But earlier, when I counted step by step, I thought April 3 was Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nLet me check again. Let's count the days step by step. January 1 is Wednesday. Let's count the days:\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday (day 0)\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (day 7)\n\nJanuary 15: Wednesday (day 14)\n\nJanuary 22: Wednesday (day 21)\n\nJanuary 29: Wednesday (day 28)\n\nThen January 30: Thursday (day 29)\n\nJanuary 31: Friday (day 30)\n\nFebruary 1: Saturday (day 31)\n\nFebruary 2: Sunday (day 32)\n\nFebruary 3: Monday (day 33)\n\nFebruary 4: Tuesday (day 34)\n\nFebruary 5: Wednesday (day 35)\n\nFebruary 6: Thursday (day 36)\n\nFebruary 7: Friday (day 37)\n\nFebruary 8: Saturday (day 38)\n\nFebruary 9: Sunday (day 39)\n\nFebruary 10: Monday (day 40)\n\nFebruary 11: Tuesday (day 41)\n\nFebruary 12: Wednesday (day 42)\n\nFebruary 13: Thursday (day 43)\n\nFebruary 14: Friday (day 44)\n\nFebruary 15: Saturday (day 45)\n\nFebruary 16: Sunday (day 46)\n\nFebruary 17: Monday (day 47)\n\nFebruary 18: Tuesday (day 48)\n\nFebruary 19: Wednesday (day 49)\n\nFebruary 20: Thursday (day 50)\n\nFebruary 21: Friday (day 51)\n\nFebruary 22: Saturday (day 52)\n\nFebruary 23: Sunday (day 53)\n\nFebruary 24: Monday (day 54)\n\nFebruary 25: Tuesday (day 55)\n\nFebruary 26: Wednesday (day 56)\n\nFebruary 27: Thursday (day 57)\n\nFebruary 28: Friday (day 58)\n\nSo February 28 is Friday. Then March 1 is Saturday (day 59). March 1 is Saturday.\n\nMarch 8: Saturday (day 66)\n\nMarch 15: Saturday (day 73)\n\nMarch 22: Saturday (day 80)\n\nMarch 29: Saturday (day 87)\n\nMarch 30: Sunday (day 88)\n\nMarch 31: Monday (day 89)\n\nApril 1: Tuesday (day 90)\n\nApril 2: Wednesday (day 91)\n\nApril 3: Thursday (day 92)\n\nWait, so according to this step-by-step count, April 3 is Thursday. But according to the other method, 93 days later is 93 mod 7 = 93 /7 is 13*7=91, 93-91=2. So 2 days after Wednesday is Friday. But that contradicts the step-by-step count. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! Wait, the problem is in the calculation of the number of days. If January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is day 92 (since from day 0 to day 92 is 93 days later). Wait, because day 0 is January 1, day 1 is January 2, ..., day 92 is April 3. So the total days between January 1 and April 3 is 92 days. So 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 13*7=91, 92-91=1. So adding 1 day to Wednesday is Thursday. Which matches the step-by-step count. So the mistake was in the previous calculation where I thought it was 93 days. So the correct number of days is 92. So 92 mod 7 is 1, so adding 1 day to Wednesday is Thursday. Therefore, the answer is Thursday.\n\nSo the step-by-step count shows that April 3 is Thursday. Therefore, the answer should be Thursday. But why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought that the total days from January 1 to April 3 is 93, but that's incorrect. Because if January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is day 92. So the total days between them is 92 days. So 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Wednesday gives Thursday. Therefore, the correct answer is Thursday.\n\nSo the answer is Thursday.\n</think>", "Thursday"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 10 to Tuesday, June 14, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays directly. But maybe the first approach is better.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate the total days? Let me check the dates. Let's break it down month by month. April 10 to April 30, then May 1 to May 31, then June 1 to June 14.\n\nFirst, April 10 is a Sunday. Let me check what day of the week each date is. Wait, maybe I need to know the days of the week for each date in the period. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. But maybe I need to check how many weekends are in each month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that from April 10 (Sunday) to June 14 (Tuesday) is a certain number of days. Let me calculate the total days first. Let's see:\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 10 to April 30 is 30 - 10 = 20 days. But since April 10 is included, that's 20 days plus 1 (the starting day) equals 21 days? Wait, no. Wait, if I have April 10 to April 30 inclusive, that's 30 - 10 + 1 = 21 days. Then May has 31 days, and June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total days would be 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check again. April 10 to April 30: 30 - 10 = 20 days between them, but including both ends, it's 21 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 21 + 31 = 52 days. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total is 52 + 14 = 66 days. So total days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is 66 days. \n\nNow, out of these 66 days, how many are weekends? Let's find the number of Saturdays and Sundays. \n\nBut since April 10 is a Sunday, let's check the days. Let me list the days of the week for each month. \n\nStarting with April 10, 2022: Sunday. Then April 11 is Monday, 12 Tuesday, 13 Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, etc. \n\nSo in April, the first week starts on April 10 (Sunday). Let's see how many Saturdays and Sundays are in April. \n\nApril 10 is Sunday. So the next Sunday is April 17, 24, and 31. Wait, April 30 is a Monday? Wait, let me check. April 10 is Sunday. April 17 is Sunday (10+7). April 24 is Sunday, and April 31 is Sunday. Wait, but April has 30 days. So April 30 is a Monday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, if April 10 is Sunday, then April 17 is Sunday, 24 is Sunday, and 31 would be Sunday. But April only has 30 days, so April 31 is not a real date. Therefore, the last Sunday in April is April 24. Then April 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, April 10 is Sunday. Let me count the days step by step. \n\nApril 10: Sunday\n\nApril 11: Monday\n\nApril 12: Tuesday\n\nApril 13: Wednesday\n\nApril 14: Thursday\n\nApril 15: Friday\n\nApril 16: Saturday\n\nApril 17: Sunday\n\nApril 18: Monday\n\nApril 19: Tuesday\n\nApril 20: Wednesday\n\nApril 21: Thursday\n\nApril 22: Friday\n\nApril 23: Saturday\n\nApril 24: Sunday\n\nApril 25: Monday\n\nApril 26: Tuesday\n\nApril 27: Wednesday\n\nApril 28: Thursday\n\nApril 29: Friday\n\nApril 30: Saturday\n\nWait, so April 30 is a Saturday. So in April, the Sundays are 10, 17, 24. That's three Sundays. Then Saturdays are 16, 23, 30. Three Saturdays. So in April, there are 3 Saturdays and 3 Sundays. So that's 6 weekend days in April. \n\nThen May. Let's check May. May 1, 2022. Since April 30 is a Saturday, May 1 is a Sunday. Wait, April 30 is Saturday, so May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, etc. So May 1 is Sunday. So May has 31 days. Let's find the number of Sundays and Saturdays in May. \n\nMay 1 is Sunday. Then Sundays are 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's five Sundays. Saturdays would be the day before each Sunday. So May 7, 14, 21, 28, and then the next Saturday would be May 31? Wait, May 31 is the last day of May. Let me check. May 1 is Sunday. So May 7 is Saturday (the first Saturday). Then 14, 21, 28, and then 31? Wait, May 28 is a Saturday. Then May 29 is Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. Wait, so May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, the Saturdays in May are 7, 14, 21, 28. That's four Saturdays. So in May, there are 5 Sundays and 4 Saturdays. So that's 9 weekend days. \n\nThen June. June 1 is a Wednesday (since May 31 is Tuesday, so June 1 is Wednesday). Wait, May 31 is Tuesday, so June 1 is Wednesday. Let's check the days in June. The period we are considering ends on June 14. So June 1 is Wednesday. Let's find the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in June from June 1 to June 14. \n\nJune 1: Wednesday\n\nJune 2: Thursday\n\nJune 3: Friday\n\nJune 4: Saturday\n\nJune 5: Sunday\n\nJune 6: Monday\n\nJune 7: Tuesday\n\nJune 8: Wednesday\n\nJune 9: Thursday\n\nJune 10: Friday\n\nJune 11: Saturday\n\nJune 12: Sunday\n\nJune 13: Monday\n\nJune 14: Tuesday\n\nSo in June, from June 1 to June 14, the weekends are June 4 (Saturday), 5 (Sunday), 11 (Saturday), 12 (Sunday). So that's four weekend days. \n\nSo total weekends in the entire period: April (6) + May (9) + June (4) = 19. \n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the total days are 66. So if there are 19 weekend days, then the number of weekdays would be 66 - 19 = 47. But wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check again. \n\nApril: 3 Sundays and 3 Saturdays. That's 6. Correct. \n\nMay: 5 Sundays and 4 Saturdays. 9. Correct. \n\nJune: 4 weekend days (June 4,5,11,12). Correct. \n\nTotal 6+9+4=19. \n\nSo 66 total days minus 19 weekend days equals 47 weekdays. \n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the number of each weekday. \n\nStarting from April 10 (Sunday) to June 14 (Tuesday). \n\nLet me list the days. \n\nFirst, April 10 is Sunday. So the first day is Sunday. Then the next days. \n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of each weekday. \n\nIn April, from April 10 to April 30 (21 days). \n\nApril 10 is Sunday. Let's count how many Mondays, Tuesdays, etc. \n\nApril 10: Sunday\n\nApril 11: Monday\n\nApril 12: Tuesday\n\nApril 13: Wednesday\n\nApril 14: Thursday\n\nApril 15: Friday\n\nApril 16: Saturday\n\nApril 17: Sunday\n\nApril 18: Monday\n\nApril 19: Tuesday\n\nApril 20: Wednesday\n\nApril 21: Thursday\n\nApril 22: Friday\n\nApril 23: Saturday\n\nApril 24: Sunday\n\nApril 25: Monday\n\nApril 26: Tuesday\n\nApril 27: Wednesday\n\nApril 28: Thursday\n\nApril 29: Friday\n\nApril 30: Saturday\n\nSo in April, the days:\n\nSundays: 10,17,24 (3)\n\nSaturdays: 16,23,30 (3)\n\nMondays: 11,18,25 (3)\n\nTuesdays: 12,19,26 (3)\n\nWednesdays: 13,20,27 (3)\n\nThursdays: 14,21,28 (3)\n\nFridays: 15,22,29 (3)\n\nSo in April, each weekday (Monday-Friday) occurs 3 times, and weekends 3 each. So total 3*5=15 weekdays in April. \n\nThen May has 31 days. May 1 is Sunday. So the days in May:\n\nSundays: 1,8,15,22,29 (5)\n\nSaturdays: 7,14,21,28 (4)\n\nMondays: 2,9,16,23,30 (5)\n\nTuesdays: 3,10,17,24,31 (5)\n\nWednesdays: 4,11,18,25 (4)\n\nThursdays: 5,12,19,26 (4)\n\nFridays: 6,13,20,27 (4)\n\nWait, but May has 31 days. Let me check the count again. \n\nWait, May 1 is Sunday. So May 2 is Monday. So Mondays are 2,9,16,23,30. That's 5 Mondays. \n\nTuesdays: 3,10,17,24,31. That's 5 Tuesdays. \n\nWednesdays: 4,11,18,25. That's 4 Wednesdays. \n\nThursdays: 5,12,19,26. 4 Thursdays. \n\nFridays: 6,13,20,27. 4 Fridays. \n\nSaturdays: 7,14,21,28. 4 Saturdays. \n\nSundays: 1,8,15,22,29. 5 Sundays. \n\nSo in May, the weekdays (Monday-Friday) are 5+5+4+4+4 = 22. \n\nThen June 1 to June 14. June 1 is Wednesday. \n\nJune 1: Wednesday\n\nJune 2: Thursday\n\nJune 3: Friday\n\nJune 4: Saturday\n\nJune 5: Sunday\n\nJune 6: Monday\n\nJune 7: Tuesday\n\nJune 8: Wednesday\n\nJune 9: Thursday\n\nJune 10: Friday\n\nJune 11: Saturday\n\nJune 12: Sunday\n\nJune 13: Monday\n\nJune 14: Tuesday\n\nSo in June, from June 1 to June 14, the weekdays are:\n\nWednesdays: 1,8 (2)\n\nThursdays: 2,9 (2)\n\nFridays: 3,10 (2)\n\nMondays: 6,13 (2)\n\nTuesdays: 7,14 (2)\n\nSaturdays: 4,11 (2)\n\nSundays: 5,12 (2)\n\nSo the weekdays (Monday-Friday) in this period are 2+2+2+2+2 = 10. \n\nSo total weekdays: April (15) + May (22) + June (10) = 47. \n\nSo that matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 47. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. For example, using the total days (66) minus the number of weekends (19) gives 47. \n\nYes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to calculate it manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then 2022 would be one year before. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday? Because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 would start on Sunday minus 1 day, which is Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check again. If 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 would start on Sunday minus 1 day, which is Saturday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, let's count the days from January 1, 2022 (Saturday) to December 20, 2022. Let's see. Let's break it down into months.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then, January 31 is 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So January 31 would be Saturday + 2 days = Monday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28 is also a Monday. March has 31 days. March 31 is 31 days after February 28. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 31 would be Monday + 3 days = Thursday. April has 30 days. April 30 is 30 days after March 31. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 30 is Thursday + 2 days = Saturday. May has 31 days. May 31 is 31 days after April 30. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So May 31 is Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. June has 30 days. June 30 is 30 days after May 31. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So June 30 is Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday. July has 31 days. July 31 is 31 days after June 30. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So July 31 is Thursday + 3 days = Sunday. August has 31 days. August 31 is 31 days after July 31. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So August 31 is Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. September has 30 days. September 30 is 30 days after August 31. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So September 30 is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. October has 31 days. October 31 is 31 days after September 30. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So October 31 is Friday + 3 days = Monday. November has 30 days. November 30 is 30 days after October 31. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So November 30 is Monday + 2 days = Wednesday. Then December 1 is Thursday. Then December 20 is 19 days after December 1. Let's count that. December 1 is Thursday. December 8 is Thursday again (7 days later). Then December 15 is Thursday, and December 22 is Thursday. So December 20 is two days before December 22. So December 22 is Thursday, so December 21 is Wednesday, and December 20 is Tuesday. Therefore, December 20, 2022 was a Tuesday.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that again. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, and so on. Then January 31 is 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. That seems correct. Then February 28 is Monday. March 31 is Thursday. April 30 is Saturday. May 31 is Tuesday. June 30 is Thursday. July 31 is Sunday. August 31 is Wednesday. September 30 is Friday. October 31 is Monday. November 30 is Wednesday. December 1 is Thursday. Then December 20 is 19 days after December 1. Let's count 19 days. 19 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 5 days. So Thursday + 5 days is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, December 20, 2022 was a Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [124, "Is 2014 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2014 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me check that again.\n\nFirst, check if 2014 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2014 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2014 minus 2000 is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3.5. So that's not a whole number. Therefore, 2014 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should verify that again. 4 times 503 is 2012, right? So 2012 is a leap year. Then 2012 +4 is 2016, so 2014 would be two years after 2012, so not divisible by 4. So that would mean 2014 isn't a leap year. \n\nBut wait, what about the century years? Well, 2014 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So the only rule that applies here is the first one: divisible by 4. Since 2014 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. So the answer should be No.\n</think>", "No"], [124, "In a year where Sunday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 11. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find out what day of the week April 11th is, given that January 1st is a Sunday. Hmm, I need to figure out the number of days between January 1st and April 11th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are in each month from January to April. January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think we can assume it's not a leap year. So February has 28 days. March has 31 days, and April has 30 days. But we need the days up to April 11th.\n\nSo starting from January 1st (Sunday), let's count the days step by step. January has 31 days, so January 1st is day 0 (Sunday). Then, the next month is February, which has 28 days. So February 1st would be day 31 (since January has 31 days). Then March has 31 days, so March 1st is day 31 + 28 = 59. Then April 1st would be day 59 + 31 = 90. Wait, but April 11th is 11 days after April 1st. So total days from January 1st to April 11th is 90 + 11 = 101 days.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days up to February 28th. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 59 + 31 = 90 days up to March 31st. Then April 1st is day 91, right? Because March has 31 days, so March 31st is day 90, so April 1st is day 91. Then April 11th is 11 days after that, so 91 + 11 = 102 days total from January 1st. Wait, but that contradicts my previous calculation. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me think again. If January 1st is day 0 (Sunday), then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So January 1st is day 0. Then January 31st is day 30 (since 31 days in January, but day 0 is the first day). Wait, maybe I need to clarify: if January 1st is day 0, then the number of days from January 1st to April 11th is 101 days? Or 102?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of days between the two dates. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so adding that gives 59 + 31 = 90 days. Then April 1st is 90 days after January 1st. Then April 11th is 11 days after that, so 90 + 11 = 101 days. So total days from January 1st to April 11th is 101 days. But since January 1st is a Sunday, we need to find what day of the week is 101 days later.\n\nBut wait, if January 1st is day 0 (Sunday), then day 1 is January 2nd, which is Monday. So each day after that adds one. So the day of the week can be calculated by taking the total number of days (101) modulo 7. Because 7 days a week. So 101 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7*14=98, so 101-98=3. So 101 days later is 3 days after Sunday. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Wait, but wait. Wait, if day 0 is Sunday, then day 1 is Monday, day 2 is Tuesday, day 3 is Wednesday. So 101 days later would be Wednesday. So April 11th is a Wednesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is Sunday. Let's count the days in each month:\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to Feb 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90 days. Then April 1 is 91 days from Jan 1. Then April 11 is 91 + 10 = 101 days. Wait, because April 1 is day 91, so April 2 is 92, ..., April 11 is 91 + 10 = 101. So that's correct. So 101 days from Jan 1.\n\nNow, 101 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 3 days. So 14*7=98, 101-98=3. So 3 days after Sunday is Wednesday. So April 11th is a Wednesday. But wait, let me check with another method. Maybe using a calendar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the days for each month. Let's see. January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26, April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Wait, so April 2 is a Sunday. Then April 9 is Sunday, April 16 is Sunday. So April 11 is 11-9=2 days before April 16. So April 16 is Sunday, so April 11 is Saturday? Wait, that contradicts the previous answer. Wait, this is confusing. Which is correct?\n\nWait, if April 2 is Sunday, then April 1 is Saturday. Then April 2 is Sunday. So April 11 is 10 days after April 1. April 1 is Saturday. Then April 2 is Sunday, April 3 is Monday, April 4 is Tuesday, April 5 is Wednesday, April 6 is Thursday, April 7 is Friday, April 8 is Saturday, April 9 is Sunday, April 10 is Monday, April 11 is Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. So according to this, April 11 is Tuesday. But according to the first calculation, it was Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a contradiction here. So where is the mistake?\n\nLet me check the first method again. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 1 is day 0. Then January 8 is day 7 (Sunday again). Then January 15 is day 14 (Sunday). January 22 is day 21 (Sunday). January 29 is day 28 (Sunday). Then February 5 is day 35 (Sunday). February 12 is day 42 (Sunday). February 19 is day 49 (Sunday). February 26 is day 56 (Sunday). March 5 is day 63 (Sunday). March 12 is day 70 (Sunday). March 19 is day 77 (Sunday). March 26 is day 84 (Sunday). April 2 is day 91 (Sunday). So April 2 is Sunday. Therefore, April 1 is Saturday. Then April 1 is Saturday. Then April 11 is 10 days after April 1. Let's count:\n\nApril 1: Saturday\n\nApril 2: Sunday\n\nApril 3: Monday\n\nApril 4: Tuesday\n\nApril 5: Wednesday\n\nApril 6: Thursday\n\nApril 7: Friday\n\nApril 8: Saturday\n\nApril 9: Sunday\n\nApril 10: Monday\n\nApril 11: Tuesday\n\nSo according to this, April 11 is Tuesday. But according to the first calculation, 101 days from Sunday is Wednesday. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because the first calculation was wrong. Let me check again. The total days from January 1 to April 11 is 101 days. But if January 1 is day 0, then day 0 is Sunday. Then day 1 is January 2, which is Monday. So the day of the week is (day number) mod 7. So 101 mod 7 is 3. So day 3 is Wednesday. But according to the step-by-step count, April 11 is Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the total number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to April 11.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to Feb 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90 days. Then April 1 is 91 days. April 11 is 91 + 10 = 101 days. So that's correct. So 101 days from January 1. But according to the step-by-step count, April 11 is Tuesday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when you count the days from January 1 to April 11, you need to consider that January 1 is day 1, not day 0. Wait, maybe that's the mistake. If January 1 is day 1 (Sunday), then the number of days from January 1 to April 11 is 101 days. But if you calculate (101 - 1) days later, which is 100 days. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nIf January 1 is day 1 (Sunday), then the number of days between January 1 and April 11 is 101 days. But the number of days after January 1 is 100 days. Because if you have day 1 as Jan 1, then day 2 is Jan 2, etc. So the number of days between Jan 1 and April 11 is 101 days, but the number of days after Jan 1 is 100 days. So when calculating the day of the week, you need to take 100 days after Sunday. Because Jan 1 is day 1 (Sunday), so adding 100 days would be the day of the week. So 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 2 days after Sunday is Tuesday. Which matches the step-by-step count. So the mistake was in the first calculation where I considered day 0 as Jan 1. So the correct way is to count the number of days after Jan 1, which is 100 days. So 100 mod 7 is 2, so Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Therefore, April 11 is Tuesday.\n\nSo the correct answer is Tuesday. Therefore, the initial mistake was in the first calculation where I considered day 0 as Jan 1, leading to 101 days, but the correct approach is to count the days after Jan 1, which is 100 days. So the answer is Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [124, "Between Tuesday, January 25, 2022 and Tuesday, March 29, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)?

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me check the dates. Let's start by finding the total number of days between the two dates.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate the number of days between two dates? Well, I can use a calendar or maybe break it down into months. Let's see. January 25 to January 31 is 7 days (including the 25th). Then February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. Wait, but adding those up: 7 (Jan 25-31) + 28 (Feb) + 29 (Mar 1-29) = 7 + 28 is 35, plus 29 is 64 days total. Wait, but that's from Jan 25 to March 29 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if I take Jan 25 to Jan 31, that's 7 days (since inclusive). Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days would be 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days. But wait, let me check that again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 25, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let me check what day of the week March 29, 2022, is. Wait, maybe that's helpful. But maybe I can just calculate the total days. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that from Jan 25 to March 29 is 64 days. But I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to compute it manually. Let's see. January has 31 days. So from Jan 25 to Jan 31 is 31 - 25 + 1 = 7 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days is 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 64 days.\n\nNow, I need to find how many of those are business days. So subtract the number of weekends. But how many weekends are there in this period?\n\nAlternatively, since the start date is a Tuesday (Jan 25, 2022), maybe I can figure out the days of the week for each month and count the weekends.\n\nLet me check. January 25, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let's confirm that. Wait, I can check that. For example, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday. So January 25 would be 24 days later. Let's calculate 24 days from January 1. 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So January 1 + 3 weeks is January 25, which would be Saturday + 3 days. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So yes, January 25 is a Tuesday. So that's correct.\n\nSo starting on Tuesday, January 25. Let's figure out the days in each month.\n\nFirst, January 25 to January 31: 7 days. Let's list them:\n\nJan 25: Tuesday\n\nJan 26: Wednesday\n\nJan 27: Thursday\n\nJan 28: Friday\n\nJan 29: Saturday\n\nJan 30: Sunday\n\nJan 31: Monday\n\nSo in January, from the 25th to the 31st, there are 7 days. The weekends here are Saturday (29th) and Sunday (30th). So that's 2 weekend days.\n\nThen February 2022 has 28 days. Since 2022 is not a leap year. February 1, 2022, is a Tuesday (since January 31 is Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday). Let me check that. January 31 is Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 2 is Wednesday, and so on. So February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks. So each week has 2 weekends. So 4 weeks would have 8 weekend days. So in February, there are 8 weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nThen March 1, 2022, is a Wednesday (since February 28 is a Monday, because February 1 is Tuesday, and 28 days is 4 weeks, so February 28 is Tuesday + 27 days. 27 days is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. So March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday, March 2 is Thursday, March 3 is Friday, March 4 is Saturday, March 5 is Sunday, March 6 is Monday, etc. Now, March 29 is the end date. Let's check how many days are in March from March 1 to March 29. That's 29 days. Let's see how many weekends are in that period.\n\nMarch 1 is Wednesday. Let's list the weekends in March. The first weekend would be March 4 (Saturday) and March 5 (Sunday). Then next weekend is March 11, 12; March 18, 19; March 25, 26. Then March 29 is the end date. So March 25 and 26 are weekends. Then March 29 is a Tuesday. So in March, the weekends are:\n\nMarch 4-5, 11-12, 18-19, 25-26. That's 4 weekends, each with 2 days, so 8 days. But wait, March 29 is the end date. So March 29 is a Tuesday. So the last weekend in March is March 25 and 26. So that's 8 days. So March has 8 weekend days.\n\nWait, but March has 29 days. Let me check again. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in March 2022.\n\nMarch 1 is Wednesday. So March 4 is Saturday (1+3 days). Then March 5 is Sunday. Then March 11 is Saturday (4+7 days), March 12 Sunday. March 18 Saturday, 19 Sunday. March 25 Saturday, 26 Sunday. Then March 27 is Monday, 28 Tuesday, 29 Wednesday. So yes, the weekends in March are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays, totaling 8 days. So March has 8 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period: January (2) + February (8) + March (8) = 18 days. So total business days would be total days (64) minus 18, which is 46.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Wait, total days is 64. If there are 18 weekend days, then 64 - 18 = 46 business days. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check again.\n\nIn January, from 25th to 31st: 7 days. The weekends are 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun) \u2192 2 days. Correct.\n\nFebruary has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks. So 4 weeks \u00d7 2 days = 8 weekend days. Correct.\n\nMarch has 29 days. The weekends are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays, which is 8 days. Correct. So total 2 + 8 + 8 = 18. So 64 - 18 = 46. So the answer is 46?\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's count the number of weeks and the remaining days.\n\nTotal days: 64. 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. Because 9\u00d77=63, so 64 is 9 weeks and 1 day. So 9 weeks would have 9\u00d75=45 business days. Then the remaining 1 day is the 64th day. What day is that?\n\nSince the first day is Tuesday (Jan 25), the 63rd day would be the same as the first day, which is Tuesday. Then the 64th day is Wednesday. So the remaining day is a Wednesday, which is a business day. So total business days would be 45 + 1 = 46. That matches the previous calculation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 46.\n</think>", "46"], [124, "If a meeting is scheduled on the last Saturday of December 2022, on which day of the month does it occur?

Wait, if December 21 is a Wednesday, then December 20 is Tuesday, December 19 is Monday, and so on. Let me count backwards. Let's take December 21 as Wednesday.

Therefore, the answer is 31. But wait, let me check again. Let me think of another way. Let's take December 1, 2022. If December 31 is a Saturday, then December 1 is 30 days before. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if December 31 is a Saturday, then December 1 would be a Saturday minus 2 days, which is Thursday. So December 1 is a Thursday. That matches with my previous thought. So that's correct. Therefore, the last Saturday is December 31. Therefore, the answer is 31. But wait, maybe I should check another date. For example, if December 1 is a Thursday, then December 2 is Friday, December 3 is Saturday. So the first Saturday is the 3rd. Then the next ones would be 10th, 17th, 24th, and 31st. So that's five Saturdays in December. So the last one is the 31st. Therefore, the answer is 31. So the answer should be 31. But wait, the question says \"last Saturday of December 2022\". So if December 31 is a Saturday, then that's the last one. Therefore, the answer is 31. So I think that's correct.\n</think>", "31"], [124, "What day of the week was November 15, 2022? Write out the full weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week November 15, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to go back to 2022. Let me check. Wait, maybe I should find a reference date that I know. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Wait, I think 2022 started on a Sunday. Let me check that. Wait, if January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Monday. But I thought that 2022 was a leap year? No, 2022 is not a leap year. So 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Monday. But I need to confirm if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that November 15, 2022 is a certain number of days from a known date. Let's say, for example, I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Wait, October 1, 2022: Let me think. If I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then November 15 would be 31 (October has 31 days) + 15 = 46 days later. Wait, but October has 31 days, so from October 1 to October 31 is 30 days. Then November 15 is 15 days into November. So total days from October 1 to November 15 is 31 (October) - 1 (since October 1 is the starting day) + 15 = 31 + 15 -1 = 45 days? Wait, maybe I should count the days between October 1 and November 15. Let me think again. If October 1 is day 0, then October 2 is day 1, and so on. So October has 31 days, so October 1 to October 31 is 30 days (since October 1 is day 0). Then November 1 is day 31, November 2 is day 32, etc. So November 15 would be day 31 + 14 = day 45. So 45 days after October 1. If October 1 is a Saturday, then adding 45 days. Let's calculate how many weeks and days that is. 45 divided by 7 is 6 weeks (42 days) and 3 days. So adding 6 weeks would bring it back to Saturday, then 3 days later would be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So November 15 would be a Tuesday? Wait, but I'm not sure if October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Maybe I need to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday (since July 4 is 3 days after July 1). Then July 1 is Friday. Then August 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So August 1 would be Friday + 3 days = Monday. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. Then August 5 is Friday. So August 1 is 4 days before August 5, which would be Monday. Wait, August 1 would be a Monday? Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is 3 days before that. So July 1 is Monday minus 3 days, which is Friday. Then July 1 is Friday. Then August 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Friday would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So August 1 would be a Monday? Wait, but that would mean that August 1 is a Monday. Then August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. Then September 5 is Monday. September 12 is Monday, September 19 is Monday, September 26 is Monday. Then October 3 is Monday. October 10 is Monday, October 17 is Monday, October 24 is Monday, October 31 is Monday. Then November 7 is Monday. November 14 is Monday, so November 15 would be Tuesday. Wait, that seems to align with the previous calculation. So if November 15 is Tuesday, then that would be the answer. But I need to confirm if July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If that's correct, then I can count the days from January 1 to November 15. Let's see. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Sunday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 15. So adding up the days from January 1 to November 15. Let's calculate the total days. January: 31, February: 28, March: 31, April: 30, May: 31, June: 30, July: 31, August: 31, September: 30, October: 31, November: 15. Wait, but we need to count up to November 15. So the total days from January 1 to November 15 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 15 (Nov). Let me add these up step by step. \n\nJan: 31\nFeb: 31 + 28 = 59\nMar: 59 + 31 = 90\nApr: 90 + 30 = 120\nMay: 120 + 31 = 151\nJun: 151 + 30 = 181\nJul: 181 + 31 = 212\nAug: 212 + 31 = 243\nSep: 243 + 30 = 273\nOct: 273 + 31 = 304\nNov: 304 + 15 = 319 days. \n\nSo November 15 is 319 days after January 1, 2022. Since January 1 is a Sunday, we can calculate 319 days later. Now, 319 divided by 7 is 45 weeks and 4 days (since 45*7=315, 319-315=4). So 45 weeks later is the same day, Sunday, plus 4 days. Sunday + 1 is Monday, +2 Tuesday, +3 Wednesday, +4 Thursday. So November 15, 2022 would be a Thursday? Wait, but this contradicts the previous calculation where I thought it was Tuesday. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let me verify the total number of days from January 1 to November 15. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\nOctober: 31 (304)\nNovember: 15 (319). Yes, that's correct. So 319 days. Now, 319 divided by 7 is 45*7=315, remainder 4. So 4 days after Sunday is Thursday. But earlier, when I used July 4 as Monday, I thought November 15 was Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that. How can I verify that? Well, I can check an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that 2022 started on a Sunday. Let me think. For example, if I know that January 1, 2023 is a Monday, then 2022 would have started on a Sunday. Because 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on Monday, then 2022 started on Sunday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then according to that, November 15 is 319 days later, which is 45 weeks and 4 days. So Sunday + 4 days is Thursday. But earlier, when I used July 4 as Monday, I thought November 15 was Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the July 4 calculation. Let me check that again. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then July 1 is Friday. Then August 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Friday would be Monday. So August 1 is Monday. Then August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. September 5 is Monday. September 12 is Monday, September 19 is Monday, September 26 is Monday. October 3 is Monday. October 10 is Monday, October 17 is Monday, October 24 is Monday, October 31 is Monday. November 7 is Monday, November 14 is Monday, so November 15 is Tuesday. But according to the other method, it's Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nHmm. There's a discrepancy here. I need to resolve this. Let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, if November 15 is Thursday, then December 25 would be 40 days later. Let me check. November has 30 days, so November 15 to November 30 is 15 days. Then December 1 to December 25 is 25 days. Total 15 + 25 = 40 days. 40 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 5 days. So if November 15 is Thursday, then adding 5 days would be Tuesday. But if December 25 is Sunday, then that would be conflicting. So that suggests that November 15 is not Thursday. Therefore, my first calculation must be wrong. Alternatively, maybe December 25, 2022 was not a Sunday. Let me think. Wait, I think that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but if November 15 is Tuesday, then adding 40 days would be 5 weeks and 5 days. Tuesday + 5 days is Sunday. So that would align. So that suggests that November 15 is Tuesday. Therefore, the first method must have an error. Where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check the total days again. From January 1 to November 15, 2022. Let me count the days again. January has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28 days (total 59). March 31 (90). April 30 (120). May 31 (151). June 30 (181). July 31 (212). August 31 (243). September 30 (273). October 31 (304). November 15 (319). So that's correct. So 319 days. Now, if January 1 is Sunday, then 319 days later is 319 mod 7. Let me calculate 319 divided by 7. 7*45 is 315. 319-315=4. So 4 days after Sunday is Thursday. But according to the other method, it's Tuesday. So there's a conflict. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that. How can I verify that? Well, I can use another known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 is a Monday. So if 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on Monday, then 2022 must have started on Sunday. Because 365 days is 52 weeks (364 days) plus 1 day. So if 2022 started on Sunday, then 2023 would start on Monday. That seems correct. So that part is correct. Therefore, the problem must be in the other calculation. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the July 4 calculation. Let me check that again. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is Friday. Then August 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Friday would be Monday. So August 1 is Monday. Then August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. September 5 is Monday. September 12 is Monday, September 19 is Monday, September 26 is Monday. October 3 is Monday. October 10 is Monday, October 17 is Monday, October 24 is Monday, October 31 is Monday. November 7 is Monday, November 14 is Monday, so November 15 is Tuesday. But according to the other method, it's Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe July 4, 2022 was not a Monday. Let me think. If I can find another way to check. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday. So that's correct. So July 4 is Monday. Then the other calculation is correct. Therefore, November 15 is Tuesday. But why does the other method give Thursday? Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the total days from January 1 to November 15 is not 319. Let me check again. Let me count the days step by step. January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28 days (total 31+28=59). March 31 (59+31=90). April 30 (90+30=120). May 31 (120+31=151). June 30 (151+30=181). July 31 (181+31=212). August 31 (212+31=243). September 30 (243+30=273). October 31 (273+31=304). November 15 (304+15=319). So that's correct. So 319 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then 319 days later is Thursday. But according to the other method, it's Tuesday. So there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when I count the days from January 1 to November 15, I'm including January 1 as day 1, but when calculating the number of days between two dates, sometimes it's different. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then adding 319 days would be day 319. But if January 1 is day 1, then adding 318 days. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the number of days between the two dates. Let me clarify. If I want to find the"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the third Thursday in December 2022. Write the total number. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the day of the month for the third Thursday in December 2022. Let me start by recalling what date December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me see if I can count the days from there.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to look up the calendar for December 2022. But since I can't actually look it up right now, I need to calculate it. Let me think. Let's start by figuring out what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. If I can find that, then I can count the Thursdays.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Wait, if that's the case, then the first Thursday is the 1st. Then the second Thursday would be the 8th, and the third would be the 15th. So the third Thursday would be December 15, 2022. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, if December 1 is a Thursday, then adding 7 days would be the next Thursday, which is the 8th. Then another 7 days is the 15th. So the third Thursday would be the 15th. But I need to make sure that December 1, 2022, was indeed a Thursday. Let me try to confirm this.\n\nAnother way: Let's take a known date. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 1 would be 20 days earlier. Let me count backwards. December has 31 days, so December 21 is the 21st. If I subtract 20 days, that would be December 1. Let's see: 21 minus 20 is 1. So if December 21 is a Wednesday, then December 1 would be 20 days before. Since each week is 7 days, 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So subtracting 2 weeks (14 days) from December 21 would be December 7, which is also a Wednesday. Then subtracting another 6 days would be December 1. So December 1 would be Wednesday minus 6 days. Let's count: Wednesday minus 1 day is Tuesday, minus 2 is Monday, minus 3 is Sunday, minus 4 is Saturday, minus 5 is Friday, minus 6 is Thursday. So December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Therefore, the first Thursday is the 1st, second is 8th, third is 15th. So the answer should be 15. But wait, the question says \"third Thursday\", so that would be the 15th. But I need to make sure that December 2022 actually has three Thursdays. Since December has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days. So there are 4 Thursdays in December. Wait, 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks (28 days) and 3 days. So the first Thursday is the 1st, then 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th. Wait, that's five Thursdays? Wait, no. Wait, 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's five Thursdays. Wait, but 29 plus 7 is 36, which is beyond December. So December 2022 has five Thursdays. So the third one is the 15th. Therefore, the answer is 15. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If December 1 is a Thursday, then the Thursdays are 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. So the third is 15. So the answer is 15. Therefore, the answer should be 15. But I need to make sure that December 1, 2022, was indeed a Thursday. Alternatively, maybe I can check another way. For example, I know that December 31, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me check that. If December 31 is a Saturday, then December 31 minus 7 days is December 24, which would also be a Saturday. Then December 17 is Saturday, December 10 is Saturday, December 3 is Saturday, and December 24 is Saturday. Wait, but if December 1 is a Thursday, then December 24 would be 23 days later. 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Thursday would be Saturday. So that matches. So December 24 is Saturday. Then December 31 is 7 days later, which is also Saturday. So that's correct. Therefore, December 1 is a Thursday. Therefore, the third Thursday is the 15th. So the answer is 15.\n</think>", "15"], [124, "If today is Friday, March 11, 2022, what day of the week was it 58 days ago? Provide the full name of the weekday.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking what day of the week it was 58 days ago, given that today is Friday, March 11, 2022. I need to figure out the day by counting back 58 days from today.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 58 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks with a remainder. 7 times 8 is 56, so 58 minus 56 is 2. So that means 58 days ago is the same as 8 weeks and 2 days ago. Since 8 weeks is exactly 56 days, subtracting that from 58 leaves 2 days. So if today is Friday, then 58 days ago would be 2 days before Friday.\n\nWait, but wait. If I go back 8 weeks, that's 56 days, so that would still be a Friday. Then subtracting 2 more days. So Friday minus 1 day is Thursday, minus another day is Wednesday. So 58 days ago would be Wednesday? But wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, but the problem is about the day of the week, not the actual date. So even if there are different months, the day of the week would just be calculated based on the number of days. But maybe I should verify this with another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count backwards step by step. Let's see. Let's start from March 11, 2022, which is a Friday. Let's subtract 58 days. But maybe breaking it down into months. Let's see, March has 31 days. So March 11 minus 11 days would be March 1. Then March 1 is 11 days before March 11. Then March 1 is a Thursday? Wait, no. Wait, March 11 is Friday. So March 10 is Thursday, March 9 is Wednesday, etc. So March 1 would be 10 days before March 11. Wait, March 11 minus 10 days is March 1. So March 1 is a Thursday? Wait, March 11 is Friday. So March 11 minus 1 day is Thursday (March 10), minus another day is Wednesday (March 9), and so on. So March 1 would be 10 days before March 11. So 10 days before Friday is Friday minus 10 days. Let me think. 7 days before is Friday again, so 10 days before would be 3 days before Friday. So Friday minus 3 days is Tuesday? Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I should count each day. Let's see:\n\nMarch 11 is Friday.\n\nMarch 10: Thursday\n\nMarch 9: Wednesday\n\nMarch 8: Tuesday\n\nMarch 7: Monday\n\nMarch 6: Sunday\n\nMarch 5: Saturday\n\nMarch 4: Friday\n\nMarch 3: Thursday\n\nMarch 2: Wednesday\n\nMarch 1: Tuesday\n\nWait, so March 1 is a Tuesday? Wait, that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if March 11 is Friday, then March 1 is 10 days earlier. Let me count 10 days back. Let's count 7 days back: March 11 minus 7 days is March 4, which is Friday. Then 3 more days back: March 3 (Thursday), March 2 (Wednesday), March 1 (Tuesday). So yes, March 1 is Tuesday. So that's 10 days before March 11. So if I subtract 58 days, that's 58 days. So 58 days ago would be 58 days before March 11. Let me see. Let's break it down into weeks and days. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks (56 days) and 2 days. So 56 days before March 11 is March 11 minus 56 days. Let's see, March 11 minus 56 days. Since March has 31 days, March 11 minus 56 days. Let's subtract 56 days. Let's think in terms of months. Let's subtract 56 days. Let's see, 56 days is 8 weeks. So 56 days before March 11 is March 11 minus 56 days. Let's subtract 56 days. Let's see, March 11 minus 56 days. Let's subtract 31 days (March) to get to March 11 - 31 days = February 11, 2022. Then subtract another 25 days. Wait, 31 + 25 is 56. So February 11 minus 25 days. Wait, February 2022. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So February 11 minus 25 days. Let's subtract 25 days from February 11. Let's go back 25 days. February 11 minus 25 days. Let's subtract 28 days would be January 12, 2022. But since we need to subtract 25 days, that's 3 days less than 28 days. So January 12 minus 3 days is January 9, 2022. Wait, but that would be 28 days before February 11. So 25 days before February 11 is 3 days after January 9? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I should count backwards. Let's take February 11, 2022. Subtract 25 days. Let's count backwards. February 11 minus 1 day is February 10. Then subtract 25 days. Let's see, February has 28 days. So February 11 minus 25 days is February 11 - 25 days. Let's subtract 25 days from February 11. Let's subtract 28 days would be January 12, so 25 days is 3 days before that. So January 12 minus 3 days is January 9. So that would be January 9, 2022. So March 11 minus 56 days is January 9, 2022. Then, since 58 days ago is 56 days plus 2 days, so January 9 plus 2 days. Wait, no. Wait, 58 days ago is 56 days before March 11 (which is January 9) plus 2 more days. Wait, no. Wait, if 56 days before March 11 is January 9, then 58 days before March 11 is January 9 minus 2 days. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because 58 days ago is 56 days before plus 2 days. Wait, no. Wait, if today is March 11, then 56 days ago is March 11 minus 56 days. Then 58 days ago is that date minus 2 days. So if March 11 minus 56 days is January 9, then 58 days ago is January 9 minus 2 days, which is January 7, 2022. But then, what day of the week is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the day of the week for January 9, 2022. Wait, but I need to find the day of the week 58 days ago. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 58 days ago is 8 weeks and 2 days. So if today is Friday, then 8 weeks ago is also a Friday. Then 2 days before that would be Wednesday. So that would be Wednesday. But according to the previous calculation, if 58 days ago is January 7, 2022, then what day of the week is that?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check the actual day of the week for January 7, 2022. Let me think. Let's check the date. Wait, March 11, 2022 is a Friday. Let me check what day of the week January 7, 2022 was. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's check the number of days between January 7 and March 11. Let's calculate that. January has 31 days, so from January 7 to January 31 is 24 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so 28 days. Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. So total days from January 7 to March 11 is 24 + 28 + 11 = 63 days. Wait, but that's 63 days. So if January 7 is X days, then March 11 is X + 63 days. But March 11 is Friday. So if 63 days later is Friday, then January 7 would be 63 days before Friday. 63 divided by 7 is 9 weeks, so 63 days is exactly 9 weeks. So that would mean that January 7 is also a Friday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where 58 days ago was January 7. Wait, but according to this, January 7 is a Friday. But according to the first method, 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday, which is Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a mistake in my previous calculations. Let me check again. If March 11 is Friday, then 63 days later is March 11 + 63 days. Let's check that. 63 days is 9 weeks, so same day. So March 11 + 63 days is March 11 + 9 weeks = March 11 + 63 days. Let's add 63 days to March 11. March has 31 days, so March 11 + 20 days is March 31 (since 31-11=20). Then 63-20=43 days left. April has 30 days, so April 30 is 30 days. 43-30=13 days into May. So May 13. So March 11 + 63 days is May 13, 2022. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should use another way. Alternatively, maybe I should check the actual date. Wait, but I don't have a calendar here. Alternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for January 7, 2022. Let me think. If March 11 is Friday, then let's count backwards. Let's take March 11 (Friday). Let's go back 28 days (4 weeks) to February 11, which is also a Friday. Then go back another 28 days to January 11, which is also a Friday. Then go back 28 days to December 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Then go back 28 days to November 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Then go back 28 days to October 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Then go back 28 days to September 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Then go back 28 days to August 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Then go back 28 days to July 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Then go back 28 days to June 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Then go back 28 days to May 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Then go back 28 days to April 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Then go back 28 days to March 11, 2021, which is a Friday. Wait, but this seems like a lot. But maybe I'm not getting the right dates. Alternatively, maybe I should check the day of the week for January 7, 2022. Let's think. If March 11 is Friday, then March 1 is 10 days before, which we previously thought was Tuesday. Wait, earlier calculation said March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. Then February 28 is 27 days before March 1. Wait, 27 days is 3 weeks and 6 days. So February 28 is 6 days before Tuesday. So February 28 is 6 days before Tuesday. So Tuesday minus 6 days is Friday (since 7 days is a week). Wait, no. Wait, if March 1 is Tuesday, then February 28 is the day before, which is Monday. Wait, that's conflicting with previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck. If March 11 is Friday, then March 10 is Thursday, March 9 is Wednesday, March 8 is Tuesday, March 7 is Monday, March 6 is Sunday, March 5 is Saturday, March 4 is Friday, March 3 is Thursday, March 2 is Wednesday, March 1 is Tuesday. So March 1 is Tuesday. Then February 28 is the day before March 1, which is Monday. So February 28 is Monday. Then February 28 is Monday. Then February 28 minus 28 days is January 28, which is also a Monday. Then January 28 is Monday. Then January 28 minus 28 days is December 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then December 28 minus 28 days is November 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then November 28 minus 28 days is October 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then October 28 minus 28 days is September 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then September 28 minus 28 days is August 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then August 28 minus 28 days is July 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then July 28 minus 28 days is June 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then June 28 minus 28 days is May 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then May 28 minus 28 days is April 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then April 28 minus 28 days is March 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then March 28 minus 28 days is February 28, 2021, which is Monday. Then February 28 minus 28 days is January 28, 2021, which is Monday. So that's a lot of Mondays. But how does this help me?\n\nWait, if January 28 is Monday, then January 28 is Monday. Then January 28 plus 2 days is January 30, which is Wednesday. Then January 30 plus 2 days is January 31, which is Thursday. Then February 1 is Friday. Wait, but that's conflicting with earlier. Wait, if January 28 is Monday, then January 29 is Tuesday, January 30 is Wednesday, January 31 is Thursday. Then February 1 is Friday. So that's correct. So February 1 is Friday. Then February 1 is Friday. Then February 2 is Saturday, February 3 is Sunday, February 4 is Monday, February 5 is Tuesday, February 6 is Wednesday, February 7 is Thursday, February 8 is Friday, February 9 is Saturday, February 10 is Sunday, February 11 is Monday. Wait, but earlier I thought February 11 was Friday. Wait, this is conflicting. Wait, if February 1 is Friday, then February 11 is 10 days later. 10 days later would be Friday + 10 days. 7 days is a week, so 10 days is 3 days after Friday. So Friday + 3 days is Monday. So February 11 is Monday. But earlier, when I thought March 1 is Tuesday, then March 1 minus 28 days is February 1, which is Friday. Wait, but according to this, February 1 is Friday. Then March 1 is 31 days after February 1. Wait, February has 28 days, so March 1 is 28 days after February 1. So March 1 is 28 days after February 1, which is Friday. So March 1 is Friday. But earlier I thought March 1 was Tuesday. That's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me start over. If March 11 is Friday, then March 1 is 10 days before. Let's count backwards from March 11. March 11 is Friday. March 10 is Thursday, March 9 is Wednesday, March 8 is Tuesday, March 7 is Monday, March 6 is Sunday, March 5 is Saturday, March 4 is Friday, March 3 is Thursday, March 2 is Wednesday, March 1 is Tuesday. So March 1 is Tuesday. But according to the other calculation, if February 1 is Friday, then March 1 is 28 days later, which is also Friday. So that's conflicting. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error"], [124, "Name the day of the week for 10/16/2022. Give the weekday name in full.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 16, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because I remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days, so 2021 started on a Wednesday plus 366 days. Since 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days, so adding two days to Wednesday would make January 1, 2021 a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 started on a Saturday. Wait, that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I should use another approach. Let me check the actual day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 is the date in question. But maybe I can use a reference date that I know. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. July 4, 2022. If I can confirm that, then I can count the days from there to October 16.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me check. If I can find the day of the week for a date in 2022 that I know, then I can work from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to calculate it manually. Let me try to recall. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday? Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, I think that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, here's a way: Let's take a date that I know. For example, I know that March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, March 14, 2022. Let me think. If I can remember that March 14, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count the days from there to October 16. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then April 1 is Friday. Then, April has 30 days, so April 1 is Friday, April 8 is Friday, April 15 is Friday, April 22 is Friday, April 29 is Friday. Then May 6 is Friday. Then May 13 is Friday, May 20 is Friday, May 27 is Friday. June 3 is Friday. June 10 is Friday, June 17 is Friday, June 24 is Friday, June 30 is Friday. July 7 is Friday. July 14 is Friday, July 21 is Friday, July 28 is Friday. August 4 is Friday. August 11 is Friday, August 18 is Friday, August 25 is Friday. September 1 is Friday. September 8 is Friday, September 15 is Friday, September 22 is Friday, September 29 is Friday. October 6 is Friday. Then October 13 is Friday. October 20 is Friday. So October 16 would be three days before October 20, which is Friday. So October 16 would be Tuesday? Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, if October 6 is Friday, then October 13 is Friday, so October 16 is three days after October 13, which would be Monday? Wait, no. Wait, October 13 is Friday. Then October 14 is Saturday, October 15 is Sunday, October 16 is Monday. So if that's correct, then October 16, 2022 was a Monday. But I'm not sure if my assumption that April 1, 2022 was a Friday is correct. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's use Zeller's Congruence. The formula for Zeller's Congruence for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for October 16, 2022, the month is 10, so we don't need to adjust. So m = 10, q = 16, year is 2022. So K = 22, J = 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (16 + floor((13*(10 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each part:\n\nFirst, floor((13*(11))/5) = floor(143/5) = floor(28.6) = 28\n\nThen floor(22/4) = 5 (since 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, floor is 5)\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all together:\n\n16 + 28 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 16 + 28 is 44, plus 22 is 66, plus 5 is 71, plus 5 is 76, plus 100 is 176.\n\nNow 176 mod 7. Let's divide 176 by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 176 - 175 is 1. So h = 1.\n\nAccording to Zeller's Congruence, h=1 corresponds to Sunday (since 0 is Saturday, 1 is Sunday). So that would mean October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. But earlier when I tried to count from April 1, 2022 as Friday, I got Monday. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula is h = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWait, maybe I missed a term. Let me check the formula again. Oh, wait, the formula is:\n\nh = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWait, but in the calculation above, I added 5*J, which is 5*20=100. That's correct. So the calculation is correct. So h=1 is Sunday. But then why did my previous counting from April 1 give me Monday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that April 1, 2022 was a Friday is wrong. Let me check that again. Let's try to calculate April 1, 2022 using Zeller's Congruence.\n\nFor April 1, 2022: q=1, m=4, K=22, J=20.\n\nh = (1 + floor(13*(4+1)/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate:\n\nfloor(13*5/5) = floor(13) = 13\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5, floor(20/4)=5, 5*20=100.\n\nSo total is 1 + 13 + 22 +5 +5 +100 = 1+13=14, +22=36, +5=41, +5=46, +100=146.\n\n146 mod 7. 7*20=140, 146-140=6. So h=6. According to the formula, h=6 is Friday (since 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, 4=Wednesday, 5=Thursday, 6=Friday). So April 1, 2022 was a Friday. That matches my previous assumption. Then if April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. May 6 is Friday. May 13, 20, 27. June 3, 10, 17, 24, 30. July 7, 14, 21, 28. August 4, 11, 18, 25. September 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. October 6, 13, 20, 27. So October 6 is Friday. Then October 13 is Friday. October 16 is three days after October 13, which would be Monday. But according to Zeller's Congruence, October 16 is Sunday. There's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's calculation for October 16. Let me check again.\n\nFor October 16, 2022:\n\nq=16, m=10, K=22, J=20.\n\nh = (16 + floor(13*(10+1)/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nfloor(13*(11)/5) = floor(143/5) = 28.6 \u2192 28.\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5, floor(20/4)=5, 5*20=100.\n\nSo total is 16 + 28 + 22 +5 +5 +100 = 16+28=44, +22=66, +5=71, +5=76, +100=176. 176 mod 7. 7*25=175, 176-175=1. So h=1, which is Sunday. But according to the previous count, it should be Monday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the counting. Let me check again. If April 1 is Friday, then April 1 is Friday. Then April 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. May 6 is Friday. May 13 is Friday. May 20 is Friday. May 27 is Friday. June 3 is Friday. June 10 is Friday. June 17 is Friday. June 24 is Friday. June 30 is Friday. July 7 is Friday. July 14 is Friday. July 21 is Friday. July 28 is Friday. August 4 is Friday. August 11 is Friday. August 18 is Friday. August 25 is Friday. September 1 is Friday. September 8 is Friday. September 15 is Friday. September 22 is Friday. September 29 is Friday. October 6 is Friday. October 13 is Friday. October 16 is three days after October 13. October 13 is Friday, so October 14 is Saturday, October 15 is Sunday, October 16 is Monday. So according to this, it's Monday. But Zeller's says Sunday. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's formula. Let me check the formula again. Wait, the formula for Zeller's Congruence is:\n\nh = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nBut wait, some sources say that the formula is different. For example, some versions use h = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7, but others might have different conventions. Wait, maybe the formula is different for January and February. Wait, in the formula, if the month is January or February, they are treated as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. But in this case, October is month 10, so no adjustment is needed. So the formula should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the Zeller's formula for October 16, 2022.\n\nq = 16\n\nm = 10\n\nK = 22 (year is 2022, so K = 22)\n\nJ = 20 (floor(2022 / 100) = 20)\n\nSo:\n\nfloor(13*(10 + 1)/5) = floor(143/5) = 28.6 \u2192 28\n\nfloor(K/4) = floor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(J/4) = floor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*J = 5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n16 + 28 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 16 + 28 is 44, plus 22 is 66, plus 5 is 71, plus 5 is 76, plus 100 is 176.\n\n176 divided by 7 is 25*7=175, remainder 1. So h=1.\n\nAccording to the formula, h=1 is Sunday. But according to the count from April 1, it's Monday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula uses a different day numbering. Let me check the definition of h. According to Zeller's Congruence, h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday). So if h=1, that's Sunday. But according to the count, it's Monday. So there's a discrepancy. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the count. Let me check another date. For example, let's check April 1, 2022. According to Zeller's formula, h=6, which is Friday. So that's correct. Then if April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. May 6 is Friday. May 13 is Friday. May 20 is Friday. May 27 is Friday. June 3 is Friday. June 10 is Friday. June 17 is Friday. June 24 is Friday. June 30 is Friday. July 7 is Friday. July 14 is Friday. July 21 is Friday. July 28 is Friday. August 4 is Friday. August 11 is Friday. August 18 is Friday. August 25 is Friday. September 1 is Friday. September 8 is Friday. September 15 is Friday. September 22 is Friday. September 29 is Friday. October 6 is Friday. October 13 is Friday. October 16 is three days after October 13. October 13 is Friday, so October 14 is Saturday, October 15 is Sunday, October 16 is Monday. So according to this, October 16 is Monday. But Zeller's formula says Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's formula. Let me check another date. For example, let's check October 13, 2022. According to the count, it's Friday. Let's apply Zeller's formula to October 13, 2022.\n\nq=13, m=10, K=22, J=20.\n\nh = (13 + floor(13*(10+1)/5) +"], [124, "What day of the week was November 28, 2022? Answer with the weekday's name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week November 28, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, actually, I think that might not be correct. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I should check a different known date. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that might not be right either. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. Let me try to count the days from a known date. Let's say I know that November 28, 2022 is the target date. Let me think of a date that I know the weekday for. For example, I know that December 24, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but how do I know that? Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then working backward from there. Let me check. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then, November 28, 2022 would be... Let's count the days between November 28 and December 31. Let's see: November has 30 days, so from November 28 to November 30 is 2 days (29th and 30th). Then December has 31 days. So total days from November 28 to December 31 is 2 + 31 = 33 days. Wait, but if December 31 is a Saturday, then November 28 would be 33 days before that. Since 33 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 5 days. So subtracting 5 days from Saturday. Saturday minus 5 days is Monday. Wait, because Saturday minus 1 day is Friday, minus 2 is Thursday, minus 3 is Wednesday, minus 4 is Tuesday, minus 5 is Monday. So that would mean November 28, 2022 was a Monday? But I need to confirm if my assumption that December 31, 2022 was a Saturday is correct.\n\nWait, if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be the day before, which is Saturday. That seems correct. So if that's the case, then November 28 would be 33 days before December 31. Let me check the calculation again. From November 28 to November 30 is 2 days (28th to 29th is 1 day, 29th to 30th is another day, so total 2 days). Then December 1 to December 31 is 31 days. So total days from November 28 to December 31 is 2 + 31 = 33 days. So 33 days before December 31 is November 28. So 33 days is 4 weeks and 5 days. So subtracting 5 days from Saturday. Saturday minus 5 days is Monday. So that would mean November 28, 2022 was a Monday. But I need to make sure that my initial assumption about January 1, 2023 being a Sunday is correct. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. Because 2022 is not a leap year, so 2022 has 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. Wait, but I thought that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, so 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then 2022 is 365 days, so 52 weeks and 1 day, so January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. So that seems correct. Therefore, December 31, 2022 is a Saturday. Therefore, November 28, 2022 is 33 days before that. So 33 days is 4 weeks and 5 days. So subtracting 5 days from Saturday. Saturday minus 5 days is Monday. Therefore, November 28, 2022 was a Monday. But wait, I should check another way to confirm. Let me try another approach. Let's take a known date in November 2022. For example, I know that November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, if that's the case, then November 28 would be 27 days later. Let me check. If November 1 is Tuesday, then adding 7 days would be November 8 (Tuesday), 15 (Tuesday), 22 (Tuesday), and then 29 would be Tuesday. So November 29 is Tuesday, so November 28 would be Monday. That matches the previous result. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be Monday. But wait, I need to confirm that November 1, 2022 was indeed a Tuesday. How can I check that? Well, if I know that December 31, 2022 is a Saturday, then November 1 is 30 days before December 31. Wait, November has 30 days, so November 1 is 30 days before December 1. Wait, maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, if I know that November 28 is Monday, then November 29 is Tuesday, November 30 is Wednesday, December 1 is Thursday. Then December 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday, 5 is Monday, etc. Wait, but if December 31 is Saturday, then December 31 is Saturday. Let me check that. If December 1 is Thursday, then December 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. So December 29 is Thursday. Then December 30 is Friday, 31 is Saturday. That's correct. So December 31 is Saturday. Then November 28 is 33 days before that. So if November 28 is Monday, then November 29 is Tuesday, which would be 1 day after. So that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is Monday.\n</think>", "Monday"], [124, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, August 14, 2022 to Sunday, October 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Write the total number.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from August 14, 2022 (Sunday) to October 16, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the extra days. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down month by month. Let's check each month's days and count the business days.\n\nStarting with August. August 14 is a Sunday. Let's list the dates from August 14 to August 31. Wait, August has 31 days. So August 14 is Sunday. Then August 15 is Monday, 16 Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday, 20 Saturday, 21 Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo from August 14 to August 31, how many days? Let's calculate. August 14 to August 31 is 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days. Wait, 31 minus 14 is 17, plus 1 is 18 days. So 18 days in total. Now, how many of those are business days?\n\nAugust 14 is Sunday. Then the next days:\n\nAugust 14: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 15: Monday (business)\nAugust 16: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 17: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 18: Thursday (business)\nAugust 19: Friday (business)\nAugust 20: Saturday (non-business)\nAugust 21: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 22: Monday (business)\nAugust 23: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 24: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 25: Thursday (business)\nAugust 26: Friday (business)\nAugust 27: Saturday (non-business)\nAugust 28: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 29: Monday (business)\nAugust 30: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 31: Wednesday (business)\n\nSo from August 14 to August 31, that's 18 days. Let's count the business days. Let's see:\n\nFrom August 15 to August 19: 5 days (Mon-Fri) \u2013 that's 5 business days.\n\nThen August 22-26: another 5 days (Mon-Fri) \u2013 5 more.\n\nThen August 29-31: 3 days (Mon, Tue, Wed) \u2013 3 business days.\n\nTotal for August: 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 business days. Wait, but wait, August 14 is Sunday, which is excluded. Then August 15 is Monday, so the first week has 5 business days (Mon-Fri) starting on the 15th. Then the next week starts on the 22nd, which is Monday again. Then the next week starts on the 29th. So that's three weeks? Wait, but August has 31 days. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks and days. From August 14 (Sunday) to August 21 (Sunday) is 8 days (including both). That's one week (7 days) plus one day. Wait, August 14 is Sunday, then August 15 is Monday, and August 21 is Sunday again. So from August 14 to August 21 is 8 days. So that's 1 week (7 days) plus 1 day. So in that period, the business days would be from Monday to Friday (5 days) in the first week (August 15-19) and then the next week (August 22-26) is another 5 days. Then August 29-31 is 3 days. So total 5 + 5 + 3 = 13. That seems right.\n\nNow moving on to September. September has 30 days. Let's check the dates. The next day after August 31 is September 1, which is Thursday. Wait, August 31 is Wednesday. So September 1 is Thursday. Wait, August 31 is Wednesday? Wait, earlier I thought August 31 was Wednesday. Let me check again. August 14 is Sunday. Then August 15 is Monday. August 16 Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday, 20 Saturday, 21 Sunday, 22 Monday, 23 Tuesday, 24 Wednesday, 25 Thursday, 26 Friday, 27 Saturday, 28 Sunday, 29 Monday, 30 Tuesday, 31 Wednesday. Yes, August 31 is Wednesday. So September 1 is Thursday. So September starts on Thursday.\n\nSo September 1 is Thursday. Then September 2 is Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, etc. So September has 30 days. Now, how many business days in September?\n\nFrom September 1 to September 30. Let's count the number of days. 30 days. Now, since September 1 is Thursday, the first week (September 1-7) would have 5 business days (Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun? Wait no. Wait, business days are Monday-Friday. So in the first week, September 1 is Thursday, 2 Friday, 3 Saturday (non-business), 4 Sunday (non-business), 5 Monday, 6 Tuesday, 7 Wednesday. So from September 1 to 7, the business days are 1 (Thu), 2 (Fri), 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed). That's 5 business days. Then the next weeks would be 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, and 29-30.\n\nWait, but September has 30 days. So from September 1 to 30, that's 30 days. Let's break it down into weeks. Each week has 5 business days. How many full weeks are there? Let's see. From September 1 to September 7 is 7 days. Then 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, and then 29-30. So that's 4 full weeks (each 7 days) plus 2 days. Wait, 4 weeks would be 28 days. So 28 days plus 2 days (September 29 and 30). So total 30 days.\n\nSo the full weeks would be 4 weeks, each with 5 business days. So 4 * 5 = 20. Then the remaining two days: September 29 and 30. September 29 is a Thursday (since September 28 is Wednesday, 29 is Thursday, 30 is Friday). So September 29 is Thursday (business), 30 is Friday (business). So that's 2 more business days. So total business days in September would be 20 + 2 = 22.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because the first week (Sep 1-7) has 5 business days. Then each subsequent week (Sep 8-14, 15-21, 22-28) would also have 5 business days each. Then the last two days (Sep 29-30) are business days. So that's 4 weeks (each 5) plus 2 days. So 4*5=20 + 2=22. That seems correct.\n\nNow moving on to October. The next month is October. The start date is October 1, 2022. Wait, the original question is up to October 16, 2022. So October 16 is the end date. Let's check what day October 1 is. Since September 30 is Friday (from previous calculation). So October 1 is Saturday. Wait, September 30 is Friday, so October 1 is Saturday. Then October 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday, 4 Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, 11 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 13 Thursday, 14 Friday, 15 Saturday, 16 Sunday. Wait, but the end date is October 16, which is Sunday. So from October 1 (Saturday) to October 16 (Sunday). Let's count the business days in October from October 1 to October 16 inclusive.\n\nFirst, let's check the dates. October 1 is Saturday, 2 Sunday, 3 Monday, 4 Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, 11 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 13 Thursday, 14 Friday, 15 Saturday, 16 Sunday.\n\nSo from October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. Now, how many business days are there here?\n\nBusiness days are Monday-Friday. So let's list them:\n\nOctober 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri) \u2013 that's 5 days.\n\nThen October 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue), 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri) \u2013 another 5 days.\n\nThen October 16 is Sunday, which is non-business. So the remaining days are October 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 15 (Sat). So those are non-business. So the business days are the two weeks (5 + 5) = 10 days. Wait, but October 16 is included. Wait, the period is from October 1 to October 16 inclusive. So October 16 is Sunday, which is non-business. So the business days are the two weeks (October 3-7 and 10-14) plus any days in the third week. Wait, October 15 is Saturday, 16 is Sunday. So the third week would be October 15-16, which are non-business. So total business days in October would be 5 + 5 = 10.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. From October 1 to October 16:\n\nDays:\n\n1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri), 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue), 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri), 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun).\n\nSo business days are 3,4,5,6,7 (5 days), 10,11,12,13,14 (5 days). That's 10 days. So October has 10 business days.\n\nSo adding up the business days for each month:\n\nAugust: 13\n\nSeptember: 22\n\nOctober: 10\n\nTotal: 13 + 22 + 10 = 45.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because the original period is from August 14 (Sunday) to October 16 (Sunday). So August 14 is included, and October 16 is included. So in August, we had 13 business days. In September, 22. In October, 10. So total 13+22=35, plus 10 is 45. But let me check if there's any mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days between the two dates and subtract the weekends. Let's try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of days from August 14 to October 16 inclusive.\n\nAugust has 31 days. So from August 14 to August 31 is 18 days (as calculated before). Then September has 30 days, and October 16 days. So total days is 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days. Wait, 18 + 30 is 48, plus 16 is 64. So total 64 days.\n\nNow, how many weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are in these 64 days? Then subtract that from 64 to get business days.\n\nBut how to calculate the number of weekends?\n\nAlternatively, since we know the start date is Sunday (August 14) and end date is Sunday (October 16), maybe we can find the number of weeks and the extra days.\n\nFrom August 14 to October 16 is 64 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. Because 9*7=63, so 64 is 9 weeks and 1 day. But since the start and end dates are both Sundays, that might be a full 9 weeks plus one day. Wait, but if you start on Sunday and end on Sunday, the total days would be 7*weeks. But 64 days is not a multiple of 7. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, August 14 is day 1 (Sunday). Then August 15 is day 2 (Monday), and so on. Let me check the total days. August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. Then September has 30 days, so 18 + 30 = 48. Then October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So total 48 + 16 = 64 days. So 64 days in total.\n\nNow, how many weekends are in 64 days? Well, each week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). So 9 weeks would be 9*2=18 weekend days. Then there's 1 extra day (since 64-63=1). The extra day is the 64th day. Since the first day is Sunday (August 14), the 63rd day would be the same as the first day of the week, which is Sunday. Then the 64th day is the next day, which is Monday. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, if the first day is Sunday (day 1), then day 7 is Saturday (the first week ends on Saturday). Then day 8 is Sunday again. So each week is 7 days. So 9 weeks would be 63 days. So day 63 is the same as day 1 (Sunday) plus 62 days. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, since the start date is Sunday, August 14, and the end date is Sunday, October 16. Let's check how many weeks between them. Let's see:\n\nFrom August 14 (Sunday) to August 21 (Sunday) is 8 days (1 week and 1 day). Then August 21 to August 28 is another week (7 days), August 28 to September 4 is another week, September 4 to September 11, September 11 to September 18, September 18 to September 25, September 25 to October 2, October 2 to October 9, October 9 to October 16. Wait, that's 10 weeks? Wait, August 14 to August 21 is 8 days (1 week and 1 day). Then each subsequent week is 7 days. Let me count the number of weeks between August 14 and October 16.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weekends. Since the start is Sunday, and the end is Sunday, the total number of weekends would be 9 weeks (each with 2 weekend days) plus the first day (Sunday) and the last day (Sunday). Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nIf the total days are 64, and the first day is Sunday, then the days would be:\n\nWeek 1: Sunday (day 1), Monday (2), Tuesday (3), Wednesday (4), Thursday (5), Friday (6), Saturday (7) \u2013 7 days.\n\nWeek 2: Sunday (8), Monday (9), ..., Saturday (14) \u2013 7 days.\n\n...\n\nEach week has 7 days. So 9 weeks would be 63 days. Then day 63 is Saturday (since day 7 is Saturday, day 14 is Saturday, etc. So day 63 is Saturday. Then day 64 is Sunday. So the 64th day is Sunday. So in the 9 weeks, there are 9 Saturdays and 9 Sundays. So 18 weekend days. Then the 64th day is Sunday, which is a weekend day. So total weekend days would be 18 + 1 (the 64th day) = 19? Wait, no. Wait, in the 9 weeks (63 days), there are 9 Saturdays and 9 Sundays. Then the 64th day is Sunday, which is another Sunday. So total weekend days would be 9 + 9 + 1 = 19? Wait, but that can't be. Because in 63 days, there are 9 weeks, each with 2 weekend days. So 9*2=18. Then the 64th day is a Sunday, which is a weekend day. So total weekend days would be 18 + 1 = 19. Therefore, total business days would be 64 - 19 = 45. Which matches the previous total of 45. So that's a good check.\n\nSo according to this, the answer is"], [124, "Count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week it was 70 days before Friday, September 2, 2022. Let me start by understanding the problem. The question is asking to count backward 70 days from that date and find the corresponding weekday. The answer should be the full weekday name, like \"Monday\" or something like that.\n\nFirst, I should confirm the date in question. The starting point is Friday, September 2, 2022. Let me check if that's correct. Wait, September 2, 2022, was indeed a Friday. Let me verify that. Well, I can check a calendar or use some method to confirm. But since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then, counting forward, but maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 70 days is exactly 10 weeks (since 7 days per week). Wait, 70 divided by 7 is 10. So 70 days is exactly 10 weeks. If that's the case, then subtracting 70 days would be the same as subtracting 10 weeks. Since a week has 7 days, subtracting 10 weeks would land on the same day of the week. Therefore, if September 2, 2022, is a Friday, then 70 days before that would also be a Friday. But wait, that seems too straightforward. However, maybe there's a catch here. Because sometimes when you subtract days, especially across month boundaries, the number of days in each month can affect the calculation. But wait, if it's exactly 10 weeks, then regardless of the months, the day of the week should be the same. So maybe the answer is Friday again. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Let me check if 70 days is indeed exactly 10 weeks. 7 times 10 is 70, so yes. So subtracting 70 days would be the same as subtracting 10 weeks. Therefore, the day of the week should be the same. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But wait, maybe the problem is that the starting date is not a Friday? Wait, the problem says that the starting date is Friday, September 2, 2022. So if that's correct, then subtracting 70 days would be the same day of the week. Therefore, the answer is Friday. But maybe I should verify this by actually counting backward 70 days. Let me try that. Let's start from September 2, 2022. Let's subtract 70 days. Let's break it down. Let's subtract 7 days at a time. Each week is 7 days. So 70 days is 10 weeks. So subtracting 7 days 10 times. So September 2 minus 7 days is August 26, 2022. Then August 26 minus 7 days is August 19, 2022. Then August 12, 2022. August 5, 2022. July 29, 2022. July 22, 2022. July 15, 2022. July 8, 2022. July 1, 2022. June 24, 2022. Wait, that's 10 times. Wait, but each time I subtract 7 days. So starting from September 2, subtract 7 days each time. Let me count the number of steps. Let me list them:\n\n1. September 2 - 7 days = August 26 (1st week)\n2. August 26 - 7 = August 19 (2nd)\n3. August 19 -7 = August 12 (3rd)\n4. August 12 -7 = August 5 (4th)\n5. August 5 -7 = July 29 (5th)\n6. July 29 -7 = July 22 (6th)\n7. July 22 -7 = July 15 (7th)\n8. July 15 -7 = July 8 (8th)\n9. July 8 -7 = July 1 (9th)\n10. July 1 -7 = June 24 (10th)\n\nSo after 10 weeks, which is 70 days, the date would be June 24, 2022. Now, I need to check what day of the week June 24, 2022, was. But since I know that September 2, 2022, is a Friday, and if I subtract 10 weeks, then June 24 should also be a Friday. But wait, maybe I should check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for June 24, 2022. Let me think. Let's see, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, because July 1, 2022, is the 1st day of the month. Let me check. Wait, if July 1 is a Friday, then July 8 is also a Friday, and so on. But earlier, I had subtracted 7 days from July 8 to get July 1. So if July 1 is a Friday, then July 8 is a Friday. But wait, if July 1 is a Friday, then July 1 minus 7 days is June 24. So June 24 would be a Friday as well. Therefore, that would confirm that June 24, 2022, is a Friday. Therefore, the answer is Friday. But wait, maybe I should check if July 1, 2022, is indeed a Friday. Let me think. Let's take September 2, 2022, which is a Friday. Let's count the days from July 1 to September 2. Let's see. July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days. So from July 1 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September 1 is 32 days, September 2 is 33 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, July 1 to July 31 is 31 days. Then August 1 to August 31 is another 31 days. So July 1 to August 31 is 31 + 31 = 62 days. Then September 1 is 63 days, September 2 is 64 days. Wait, but September 2 is 64 days after July 1. So if September 2 is a Friday, then July 1 would be 64 days before that. Wait, but 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day. Because 7*9=63, so 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day. Therefore, if September 2 is a Friday, then July 1 would be 64 days before, which is 9 weeks and 1 day earlier. So subtracting 9 weeks (63 days) would bring us to July 1, which would be 63 days before September 2. Then, subtracting one more day would be June 30. Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I need to check this again. Let me think. If September 2 is a Friday, then September 2 minus 63 days is July 1. Because 63 days is 9 weeks. So July 1 would be a Friday as well. Then, subtracting one more day (64 days) would be June 30, which would be a Thursday. But earlier, I thought that July 1 is a Friday. So that would mean that June 24 is 7 days before July 1, which would be a Friday minus 7 days, which is also a Friday. Wait, but if July 1 is a Friday, then June 24 is 7 days before, so that would be a Friday. But according to the previous calculation, if September 2 is a Friday, then July 1 is a Friday, and June 24 is also a Friday. Therefore, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is Friday. But maybe I should check another way. Let me check the actual day of the week for June 24, 2022. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. So January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then, let's count the number of days from January 1, 2022, to June 24, 2022. Let's calculate that. January has 31 days, February 28 (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 24. So total days from January 1 to June 24 is:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (from Jan 1 to Jan 31)\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 24\n\nTotal days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 24 = Let's compute that step by step.\n\n31 + 28 = 59\n\n59 + 31 = 90\n\n90 + 30 = 120\n\n120 + 31 = 151\n\n151 + 24 = 175 days.\n\nSo June 24, 2022, is 175 days after January 1, 2022. Now, since January 1, 2022, is a Sunday, we can find the day of the week by calculating 175 days later. Since each week has 7 days, 175 divided by 7 is 25 weeks exactly. So 25 weeks later would be the same day of the week. Therefore, June 24, 2022, would be a Sunday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous conclusion that it's a Friday. Wait, this is a problem. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct? Let me check again. Wait, if January 1, 2022, is a Sunday, then adding 7 days would be January 8, which is also a Sunday. So 175 days is 25 weeks, so 25*7=175. Therefore, June 24, 2022, would be a Sunday. But earlier, I thought that June 24 is a Friday. So which is correct? There's a mistake here. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022, is a Sunday is incorrect. Let me check that. Wait, I think I might be wrong here. Let me recall. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Let me check that. If July 1, 2022, is a Friday, then January 1, 2022, would be how many days before that? Let's calculate the number of days from January 1 to July 1, 2022. January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 1. So total days from January 1 to July 1 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 1? Wait, no. Wait, from January 1 to July 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July 1)? No, that's not right. Wait, the number of days from January 1 to July 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181. So July 1 is 181 days after January 1, 2022. So if July 1 is a Friday, then January 1, 2022, would be 181 days before that. 181 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 6 days. So 181 days is 25 weeks (175 days) plus 6 days. Therefore, if July 1 is a Friday, then January 1 would be 6 days before Friday. So Friday minus 6 days is Saturday (Friday -1 is Thursday, -2 Wednesday, -3 Tuesday, -4 Monday, -5 Sunday, -6 Saturday). Therefore, January 1, 2022, would be a Saturday. But earlier I thought it was a Sunday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my initial assumption that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday was wrong. Therefore, the correct day is Saturday. Therefore, the calculation for June 24, 2022, being 175 days after January 1, 2022, would be 175 days later. Since 175 is 25 weeks, then if January 1 is a Saturday, then 25 weeks later would be also a Saturday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion that July 1 is a Friday. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to resolve this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's take the known date of September 2, 2022, which is a Friday. Let's count backward 70 days. Let's do this step by step. Let's subtract 70 days from September 2, 2022. Let's break it down into months. September has 30 days. So September 2 minus 70 days. Let's subtract 30 days first. September 2 minus 30 days is August 3 (since September 2 minus 30 days is August 3, 2022). Then subtract another 30 days: August 3 minus 30 days is July 4, 2022. Then subtract another 10 days: July 4 minus 10 days is June 24, 2022. So that's 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. So June 24, 2022, is 70 days before September 2, 2022. Now, if September 2 is a Friday, then June 24 should be the same day of the week. But earlier, when I tried to calculate using January 1, I got conflicting results. So maybe I need to check the day of the week for June 24, 2022, using another method. Let's try to find the day of the week for June 24, 2022. Let's take a known date. For example, July 1, 2022, is a Friday. Let's check that. If July 1 is a Friday, then June 24 is 7 days before that, which would be a Friday minus 7 days, which is also a Friday. Therefore, June 24, 2022, is a Friday. Therefore, that would mean that my previous calculation where I thought January 1 was a Saturday is correct. So if July 1 is a Friday, then June 24 is a Friday. Therefore, the answer is Friday. But then why did the calculation with January 1, 2022, being a Saturday lead to June 24 being a Saturday? That must be an error in that calculation. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022, is a Saturday, then adding 175 days (which is 25 weeks) would be 25 weeks later, which is also a Saturday. But if June 24 is a Friday, then that would mean that my calculation of the number of days from January 1 to June 24 is wrong. Let me recalculate that. January 1 to June 24: January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 24. So total days: 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 24 (June) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +24=175. So that's correct. So 175 days. If January 1 is a Saturday, then 175 days later is 25 weeks later, which is also a Saturday. But according to the other method, June 24 is a Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong. Let me check the day of the week for July 1, 2022. If July 1 is a Friday, then June 24 is a Friday. Let me check another date. For example, July 1, 2022, is"], [124, "In a year where Saturday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 27. Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find out what day of the week March 27 falls on, given that January 1st is a Saturday. Hmm, I need to figure out the number of days between January 1st and March 27th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, I should confirm the dates. January has 31 days, so January 1st is a Saturday. Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I'll assume it's not a leap year. So February has 28 days. March 27th is the target date.\n\nSo, from January 1st to March 27th, how many days is that? Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that to January's 31 days gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March. Wait, but wait, if we're starting from January 1st, then the total days from January 1st to March 27th would be 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 27 (March) = 86 days? Wait, but wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, etc. So the total number of days from January 1st to March 27th inclusive would be 31 + 28 + 27? Wait, no. Wait, if you count from January 1st to January 31st, that's 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March. But if we're counting from January 1st to March 27th, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 27 (Mar) = 86 days. But wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 1st is day 1, and March 27th is day 86. But wait, maybe I need to check that again. Let me think. For example, January 1 is day 1. Then January 2 is day 2, ..., January 31 is day 31. Then February 1 is day 32, and February 28 is day 31 + 28 = 59. Then March 1 is day 60, and March 27 is day 60 + 26 = 86. Wait, because March 1 is day 60, so March 27 is 27 days after March 1, which would be day 60 + 26 = 86? Wait, no. Wait, if March 1 is day 60, then March 2 is day 61, so March 27 is day 60 + 26 = 86. Yes, that's correct. So total days from January 1 to March 27 is 86 days.\n\nBut wait, if January 1 is day 1, then the number of days between January 1 and March 27 is 85 days? Because if you count from day 1 to day 86, that's 85 days later. Wait, this is a common confusion. Let me clarify. If I have two dates, the number of days between them is calculated as (end date - start date). So if January 1 is day 1, then March 27 is 86 days after January 1. But when calculating the number of days between them, if you include both start and end dates, it's 86 days. But when calculating the difference, it's 85 days. Wait, but in terms of how many days have passed since January 1, March 27 is 85 days later. Because January 1 is day 0, then day 1 is January 2. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of modulo 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of days from January 1 to March 27, then take that number modulo 7 to find the day of the week. Since January 1 is a Saturday, which is day 0. Then each day after that adds 1. So if the total days is N, then the day of the week is (Saturday + N) mod 7. Wait, but if January 1 is Saturday, then January 1 is day 0 (Saturday), January 2 is day 1 (Sunday), etc. So if March 27 is N days after January 1, then the day of the week is (Saturday + N) mod 7. But how to compute N?\n\nWait, let's get back. Let's count the days from January 1 to March 27. Let's do it step by step. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. So adding that, 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 27 is 27 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 27 is 31 + 28 + 27 = 86 days. But wait, if January 1 is day 1, then March 27 is day 86. But if we consider that January 1 is day 0, then March 27 is day 85. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. If January 1 is day 1 (Saturday), then January 2 is day 2 (Sunday), ..., January 31 is day 31 (Saturday again? Wait, 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday. Wait, that's different. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 1 is day 1 (Saturday). Then January 8 is day 8 (Saturday). Then day 15, 22, 29. Then day 30 is Sunday, day 31 is Monday. So that's correct. So March 27 is 86 days after January 1? Wait, but if January 1 is day 1, then day 86 would be March 27. But how many days is that? Let me check. January has 31 days, so from day 1 to day 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so day 31 + 28 = day 59. Then March 1 is day 60. Then March 27 is day 60 + 26 = day 86. So yes, March 27 is day 86. So the number of days between January 1 and March 27 is 85 days (since day 1 is January 1, day 86 is March 27, so 85 days later). Wait, but when you count the days between two dates, the difference is (end - start). So if start is day 1, end is day 86, then the difference is 85 days. So that's correct. So the total number of days between January 1 and March 27 is 85 days. So now, since January 1 is Saturday, adding 85 days to that. Now, since each week has 7 days, we can compute 85 mod 7. Let's calculate that. 7*12=84, so 85-84=1. So 85 mod 7 is 1. So that means 85 days later is 12 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 1 day would be Sunday. Therefore, March 27 would be a Sunday? Wait, but wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought where January 31 is Monday. Let me check again. Let me check the days step by step. Let's take January 1 as Saturday. Then January 1 is Saturday. January 8 is Saturday (7 days later). January 15 is Saturday, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday. So that's correct. Then February 1 is Tuesday. Wait, because January 31 is Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday. Then February has 28 days. So February 28 is 28 days after January 1. Let's check. January 1 is day 1 (Saturday). Then February 1 is day 32. Wait, but earlier calculation said that day 86 is March 27. Wait, maybe I need to check the total days again. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 31 is day 31. Then February 1 is day 32. Then February 28 is day 31 + 28 = day 59. Then March 1 is day 60. March 27 is day 60 + 26 = day 86. So the total days from January 1 to March 27 is 85 days later. So 85 days after Saturday. So 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (84 days) and 1 day. So 85 days later is 1 day after Saturday, which is Sunday. So March 27 is Sunday. But wait, let me check with another approach. Let's count the days step by step. Let's take January 1 as Saturday. Then January 1: Saturday. January 8: Saturday. January 15: Saturday. January 22: Saturday. January 29: Saturday. Then February 5: Saturday. February 12: Saturday. February 19: Saturday. February 26: Saturday. Then March 5: Saturday. March 12: Saturday. March 19: Saturday. March 26: Saturday. So March 26 is Saturday. Then March 27 is Sunday. Oh! So that's correct. So March 27 is Sunday. Therefore, the answer should be Sunday. So the answer is Sunday.\n</think>", "Sunday"], [124, "On which weekday did October 8, 2022 fall?

Alternatively, I can use some known dates to calculate.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think. If I can find a known date in 2022, maybe I can count forward or backward. Let me recall that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that.

For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. July 4, 2022: if July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then July 11 would be Monday again. Then August 1 would be a Monday as well? Wait, no, because July has 31 days. So July 4 is Monday, July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday, and August 1 is Monday. Wait, but that would mean August 1, 2022 was a Monday. Then August 1 is Monday, so August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. Then September 5 is Monday, September 12 is Monday, September 19 is Monday, September 26 is Monday. Then October 3 is Monday. So October 3, 2022 was a Monday. Then October 4 is Tuesday, October 5 is Wednesday, October 6 is Thursday, October 7 is Friday, October 8 is Saturday. So that would mean October 8, 2022 was a Saturday. But wait, I thought that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So if October 1 is Saturday, then October 8 is also Saturday. That seems to match. So that would be Saturday. But I need to make sure that my assumption that July 4, 2022 was a Monday is correct. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I can find the number of days between October 8, 2022 and January 1, 2023, then I can calculate the day of the week. Let's see. October 8, 2022 to October 31, 2022 is 23 days (since 31-8=23). Then November has 30 days, December has 31 days, and January 1 is 1 day. So total days from October 8 to January 1 is 23 + 30 + 31 + 1 = 85 days. Wait, but that's from October 8 to January 1, 2023. Wait, but if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then October 8, 2022 would be 85 days before that. So 85 days before Sunday. Let me calculate 85 divided by 7. 7*12=84, so 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day.

Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can break down the months involved. February 1 to April 20. Let's check each month's days. \n\nFirst, February 2022. Since 2022 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. But the start date is February 1, which is a Tuesday.

Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week May 21, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because I remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days, so 2021 started on a Wednesday plus 366 days. Wait, 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So if 2020 started on a Wednesday, then 2021 would start on Wednesday + 2 days, which is Friday. Wait, but I think that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is a known date. Wait, but I need to figure it out. Let me think again. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, if May 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then adding 20 days would get to May 21. Let me check. Wait, 20 days later. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, and May 22 is Sunday. Therefore, May 21 would be Saturday. Wait, but that would mean May 21 is Saturday. But I need to confirm if May 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday. Wait, maybe I'm wrong here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's take a date I know for sure. For example, I know that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Wait, but that's 2021. Let me check. Wait, July 4, 2021 was a Sunday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should use another method. Let me think about the day of the week for a specific date in 2022. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Wait, let me think. Let me check the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then April 1 is Friday. Then April 8 is Friday, April 15 is Friday, April 22 is Friday, and April 29 is Friday. Then May 6 is Friday. Then May 13 is Friday, May 20 is Friday, and May 27 is Friday. So May 21 would be 6 days before May 27. So May 27 is Friday, subtract 6 days: May 26 is Thursday, 25 Wednesday, 24 Tuesday, 23 Monday, 22 Sunday, 21 Saturday. So that would make May 21, 2022 a Saturday. But I need to confirm if April 1, 2022 was indeed a Friday. Wait, maybe I can check that. Let me think. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then March 1, 2022 would be a Friday minus 28 days (which is 4 weeks), so March 1 is also a Friday. Wait, but March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe my assumption is wrong. Therefore, I need to correct that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let me think about the day of the week for a specific date. For example, I know that May 21, 2022 is a Saturday. But how can I confirm that? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's true, then January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Sunday. February 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26, April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7, 14, 21, 28. So May 7 is Sunday, then May 14 is Sunday, May 21 is Sunday. Wait, that would mean May 21 is Sunday. But that contradicts my previous conclusion. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to check the actual day. Wait, but since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday. So 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 started on Monday + 1 day, which is Tuesday. Wait, that would mean January 1, 2022 was a Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 would start on Monday + 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Monday would be Tuesday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think about the day of the week for a specific date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if that's true, then July 4 is Monday. Let's count backwards. June 27 is Monday, June 20 is Monday, June 13, 6, 30 (May 30 is Monday). Wait, May 30 is Monday. Then May 23 is Monday, May 16, 9, 2. So May 2 is Monday. Then May 9 is Monday, 16, 23, 30. So May 23 is Monday. Then May 21 would be Saturday. Wait, that would make May 21 a Saturday. But if July 4 is Monday, then May 23 is Monday. So May 21 is Saturday. So that would be the answer. But how do I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday? Wait, I think that's correct. Because I remember that July 4, 2021 was a Sunday, so July 4, 2022 would be a Monday. So that's correct. Therefore, May 21, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, the answer is Saturday.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I thought that January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then May 21 would be Sunday. But that contradicts. So which is correct? Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday, then January 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Tuesday, 12, 19, 26. March 5 is Tuesday, 12, 19, 26, April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7 is Tuesday, 14, 21, 28. So May 21 is Tuesday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. So now I'm really confused. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use Zeller's Congruence. Let me try that. Zeller's Congruence formula for Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, so for May 21, 2022, m is 5, q is 21, year is 2022. So K is 22, J is 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (21 + floor((13*(5 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each part:\n\nfloor((13*6)/5) = floor(78/5) = floor(15.6) = 15\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all together:\n\n21 + 15 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 21 + 15 is 36, +22 is 58, +5 is 63, +5 is 68, +100 is 168.\n\nNow 168 mod 7 is 0. Since h=0 corresponds to Saturday. Therefore, according to Zeller's Congruence, May 21, 2022 is a Saturday. So that's the answer. Therefore, the correct answer is Saturday.\n\nBut earlier when I thought that January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then May 21 would be Tuesday. But that must be wrong. So where is the mistake here? Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday, then January 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Tuesday, 12, 19, 26. March 5 is Tuesday, 12, 19, 26, April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7 is Tuesday, 14, 21, 28. So May 21 is Tuesday. But according to Zeller's Congruence, it's Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday must be wrong. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the day of the week for 2021. Let me check. I thought that 2021 started on a Monday. Let me check that. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days, so 2021 started on Wednesday + 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. Therefore, January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 started on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, that's different from my previous thought. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Saturday, 12, 19, 26. March 5 is Saturday, 12, 19, 26, April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7 is Saturday, 14, 21, 28. So May 21 is Saturday. Which matches the Zeller's Congruence result. Therefore, my earlier mistake was in thinking that 2021 started on Monday, but actually, 2020 started on Wednesday, so 2021 started on Friday. Therefore, 2022 started on Saturday. Therefore, May 21, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, the correct answer is Saturday.\n</think>", "Saturday"], [124, "Determine if the year 2028 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2028 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2028 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2028 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2028 minus 2000 is 28. 28 divided by 4 is 7. So 500 + 7 is 507. That means 2028 divided by 4 is 507 with no remainder. So that's good, it's divisible by 4.\n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 2028 divided by 100 is 20.28, which is not an integer. So it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition (divisible by 400) doesn't apply here. \n\nSince it's divisible by 4 and not a century year, according to the rules, 2028 should be a leap year. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me verify 2028 divided by 4 again. 4 times 500 is 2000, 4 times 507 is 2028. Yes, that's correct. So no error there. And since it's not a century year, the rule is straightforward. So the answer should be Yes.\n</think>", "Yes"], [124, "Count the occurrences of Monday from Sunday, August 14 to Monday, August 15, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Hmm, so the start date is Sunday, and the end date is the next day, Monday. Let me think about the days in between.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. August 14, 2022 is a Sunday. Then August 15 is a Monday. So the period includes both dates. Now, the question is asking for the number of Mondays in this range. \n\nSince the start date is Sunday, August 14, the next day is Monday, August 15. So that's the first Monday in the range. Then, since the end date is August 15, which is a Monday, that's the only Monday in this period. Wait, but wait, the start date is Sunday, so the first day is Sunday, then the next day is Monday. So from August 14 to August 15 inclusive, there are two days. So the Mondays would be August 15th. So that's one occurrence. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's another Monday in between. But August 14 is Sunday, so the next day is Monday, August 15. Then August 16 would be Tuesday. So between August 14 and 15, inclusive, there's only one Monday. So the answer should be 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual calendar. Let me think. Let me check the days again. August 14, 2022 is a Sunday. So August 15 is Monday.

So 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Because 2022 has 365 days, so subtracting one day from Sunday would be Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, let's check February 1, 2022. January has 31 days, so 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 would be 3 days after Saturday, which is Tuesday. So February 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Then March 1 is 28 days after February 1 (since 2022 is not a leap year). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 is a Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 is a Sunday. Then June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So June 1 is a Wednesday. Then July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So July 1 is a Friday. Wait, so July 1, 2022 is a Friday. Then July 4 is 3 days later, which would be Monday. So July 4, 2022 is a Monday. That seems correct. Then August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So July 1 is Friday, adding 3 days would make August 1 a Monday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation where I thought July 1 was Saturday. Wait, but according to this, July 1 is Friday. So if July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday.

Then August 27 is 5 days after August 22. So August 22 is Monday, August 23 is Tuesday, 24 Wednesday, 25 Thursday, 26 Friday, 27 Saturday. Wait, so August 27, 2022 would be a Saturday? But earlier I thought that August 26 was Saturday. Wait, but according to this, August 22 is Monday, so August 27 is Saturday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought August 26 was Saturday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in that earlier calculation. Let me check again.\n\nIf July 1 is Friday, then July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. Then August 5 is Friday. Then August 6 is Saturday, August 7 is Sunday, August 8 is Monday. So August 8 is Monday. Then August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. So August 22 is Monday. Then August 23 is Tuesday, 24 Wednesday, 25 Thursday, 26 Friday, 27 Saturday. So August 27 is Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday. But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, if August 22 is Monday, then August 22 is Monday. Let's check if that's correct. If July 1 is Friday, then July 1 is Friday. Then July 4 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. Then August 8 is Monday. Then August 15 is Monday. Then August 22 is Monday. That seems correct. So August 22 is Monday. Then August 27 is 5 days later, which is Saturday. Therefore, August 27, 2022 is a Saturday. But I need to make sure that my initial assumption that July 1 is Friday is correct. Because if that's wrong, then the entire calculation is wrong.\n\nEarlier, I thought that January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. March 1 is Tuesday. April 1 is Friday. May 1 is Sunday. June 1 is Wednesday. July 1 is Friday. That seems correct. Because from May 1 (Sunday) to June 1 is 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. Then July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. So July 1 is Friday. That seems correct. Therefore, the calculation is correct. Therefore, August 27, 2022 is Saturday. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when I check online, I remember that August 27, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that August 27, 2022 is 5 days after August 22. If August 22 is Monday, then August 27 is Saturday. But if I can find another date that I know, like August 22, 2022. For example, if I know that August 22, 2022 is a Monday, then that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that August 15, 2022 was a Monday.

Then August 23 is Tuesday, 24 Wednesday, 25 Thursday, 26 Friday, 27 Saturday. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, August 27, 2022 is a Saturday.

For example, if I know that July 4, 2022, was a Monday, then July 1 would be three days before that. So July 4 is Monday, so July 3 is Sunday, July 2 is Saturday, July 1 is Friday. Yes, that matches. So that's correct. Therefore, the first Tuesday is July 5th. So the answer should be 5. But wait, the question says \"the first Tuesday of July 2022\". So if July 1 is Friday, then the first Tuesday is the 5th. So the answer is 5. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any other possibility.

The problem says that January 1st is a Sunday, and I need to find out what day of the week January 21st is. Hmm, right. So first, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 21st. Let me think. Well, January 1st is day 1, so January 21st would be 20 days later, right? Because from the 1st to the 21st is 20 days difference.\n\nWait, but when you count days, if you start on day 1 (Sunday), then adding days would go like: day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, day 3 Tuesday, and so on. So each week has 7 days. So to find out what day of the week it is, I can divide the number of days after January 1st by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the 21st is from Sunday.\n\nSo 20 days later. Let me divide 20 by 7. 7 times 2 is 14, which leaves a remainder of 6. So 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So that means 21st is 6 days after Sunday. Let me count: Sunday (0), Monday (1), Tuesday (2), Wednesday (3), Thursday (4), Friday (5), Saturday (6). So 6 days after Sunday is Saturday. Wait, but wait, if January 1 is Sunday, then adding 7 days would be the next Sunday. So 14 days later is also a Sunday. Then 14 + 6 = 20 days. So 20 days later is 2 weeks and 6 days. So starting from Sunday, adding 6 days would be Saturday. So January 21st is a Saturday?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me count the days step by step. Let's list out the dates:\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Sunday (another 7 days)\n\nJanuary 22: Sunday (another 7 days). Wait, but that would be January 22nd. So January 21st is one day before that. So if January 22 is Sunday, then January 21st is Saturday. Yes, that matches my previous conclusion. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days from January 1 to January 21. Let's see. From 1st to 21st is 20 days. So 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks (14 days) and 6 days. So 2 weeks later is the same day, Sunday. Then 6 days after Sunday is Saturday. Yep, that's the same answer. So I think that's correct.

Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2015 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2015 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2015 minus 2000 is 15. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75. So that's not a whole number. Therefore, 2015 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check again. 4 times 503 is 2012, right? Then 2012 plus 4 is 2016. So 2015 is between those two, so yes, not divisible by 4. So that would mean it's not a leap year. But wait, what about the century years? Well, 2015 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So the only rule that applies here is the first one. Since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2022 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2022 divided by 4. 4 times 505 is 2020, so 2022 minus 2020 is 2. That leaves a remainder of 2, so 2022 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check. Let me add the last two digits, 22, and see if that's divisible by 4. 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, which isn't a whole number. So that confirms it. 2022 isn't divisible by 4.\n\nBut wait, what about the century years? The rule is that if a year is divisible by 100, it's not a leap year unless it's also divisible by 400. However, 2022 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So even if it were divisible by 4, which it isn't, the century rule wouldn't apply here. But since it's not divisible by 4 at all, the answer is no. \n\nSo, putting it all together: 2022 isn't divisible by 4, so it's not a leap year.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yes, that seems right. So if that's the case, then each subsequent date can be calculated by adding days.\n\nBut maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use another approach. Let's think about some known dates in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. July 4, 2022. If I can remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then maybe I can work backwards. Let's see. June has 30 days. So July 4 is 30 days after June 30. Wait, no. Wait, June has 30 days, so June 30 is 30 days before July 1. So July 4 is 4 days after July 1. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the number of days between June 26 and July 4. Let's see. June 26 to June 30 is 4 days (27th, 28th, 29th, 30th). Then July 1 is 1 day, July 2 is 2, July 3 is 3, July 4 is 4. So from June 26 to July 4 is 4 + 4 = 8 days. Wait, that's 8 days. So if July 4 is a Monday, then June 26 would be 8 days before that. Let's count backwards. July 4 is Monday. July 3 is Sunday, July 2 is Saturday, July 1 is Friday. Then June 30 is Thursday. June 29 is Wednesday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 27 is Monday, June 26 is Sunday. Wait, that would mean June 26, 2022 was a Sunday? But I'm not sure if July 4, 2022 was actually a Monday. Maybe I should check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 25 days to June 1 would get to June 26. Let me check. 25 days later. Since 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So if June 1 is Wednesday, then adding 3 weeks (21 days) would be June 22, which is also Wednesday. Then adding 4 days: June 23 is Thursday, 24 is Friday, 25 is Saturday, 26 is Sunday. So that would make June 26 a Sunday. But I need to confirm if June 1, 2022 was indeed a Wednesday. How can I check that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let's count the days from January 1 to June 26. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, February 28 (since 2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 26. So total days from January 1 to June 26 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 26 (June) = let's calculate that. 31 + 28 is 59. 59 + 31 is 90. 90 + 30 is 120. 120 + 31 is 151. 151 + 26 is 177 days. So 177 days from January 1, 2022. Now, since January 1 is a Sunday, adding 177 days. Let's divide 177 by 7 to find the number of weeks and days. 7*25 is 175, so 177 is 25 weeks and 2 days. So 25 weeks later is also a Sunday, then adding 2 days would be Monday and Tuesday. Wait, so that would mean that June 26 is a Tuesday? But that contradicts the previous calculation. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, there must be a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again. Let me recount the days from January 1 to June 26. January has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February is 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90. April has 30 days, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120. May has 31 days, so up to May 31 is 120 + 31 = 151. Then June 26 is 26 days into June. So total days from January 1 to June 26 is 151 + 26 = 177. That's correct. So 177 days. Now, 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks (175 days) and 2 days. So if January 1 is a Sunday, then adding 175 days is also a Sunday. Then adding 2 days would be Monday (175 + 1) and Tuesday (175 + 2). Therefore, June 26 would be a Tuesday. But earlier, when I thought that June 1 was a Wednesday, adding 25 days (which is 3 weeks and 4 days) would make June 26 a Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is conflicting. There must be an error in one of the assumptions. Let me check the assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. How can I verify that? Maybe I can check a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. That seems correct. So that part is correct. Then the calculation of 177 days from January 1, 2022 would be 25 weeks and 2 days. So June 26 would be a Tuesday. But then why did the other method give Sunday?\n\nWait, maybe the other method was wrong. Let me check again. If June 1 is a Wednesday, then adding 25 days would be June 26. Let me check that. June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 8 is Wednesday (7 days later), June 15 is Wednesday, June 22 is Wednesday. Then June 23 is Thursday, 24 Friday, 25 Saturday, 26 Sunday. So that would be Sunday. But according to the other calculation, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption that June 1 is a Wednesday is wrong. Let me check. If January 1 is Sunday, then let's calculate June 1. Let's count the days from January 1 to June 1. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 1. So total days from January 1 to June 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 1 (June 1) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 31 is 151, plus 1 is 152. So 152 days from January 1. 152 divided by 7 is 21 weeks (147 days) and 5 days. So 21 weeks later is Sunday, then adding 5 days would be Friday (Sunday + 1 is Monday, +2 Tuesday, +3 Wednesday, +4 Thursday, +5 Friday). So June 1 would be a Friday. Wait, that contradicts the previous assumption that June 1 was a Wednesday. So that must mean that my previous assumption was wrong. Therefore, the correct day for June 1 is Friday. Then adding 25 days (June 1 to June 26) would be 25 days. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So Friday + 4 days is Tuesday. So June 26 would be Tuesday. That matches the first calculation. So that means the earlier assumption that June 1 was a Wednesday was incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is Tuesday?\n\nBut then why did I think that June 1 was a Wednesday? Maybe I confused the year. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is Sunday, then June 1 is Friday. So that would mean that June 26 is Tuesday. But then, if July 4 is Monday, then June 26 would be Sunday. But that contradicts. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another known date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday. Let me check that. July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. So that's correct. So July 4 is Monday. Then, as before, June 26 is 8 days before July 4. So July 4 is Monday. Subtract 8 days: July 4 minus 7 days is July 1 (Friday), minus 1 more day is June 30 (Thursday). Then June 29 (Wednesday), June 28 (Tuesday), June 27 (Monday), June 26 (Sunday). Wait, that's conflicting again. So according to this, June 26 is Sunday. But according to the other calculation, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is very confusing. There must be a mistake in one of the calculations. Let me check the days again. Let's start from January 1, 2022 as Sunday. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Sunday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days after January 1. Let's check: January 1 is day 1 (Sunday). January 2 is day 2 (Monday), ..., January 29 is day 29 (Sunday). Then February 1 is day 30 (Monday). February 2 is day 31 (Tuesday), ..., February 28 is day 30 + 27 = 57 days. Wait, 30 (Jan 31) + 28 (Feb 28) = 58 days. Wait, maybe I should count the days from January 1 to February 28. January has 31 days, so February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. So day 59 is February 28. Then March 1 is day 60. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 60 + 30 = 90. April 1 is day 91. April has 30 days, so April 30 is day 91 + 29 = 120. May 1 is day 121. May has 31 days, so May 31 is day 121 + 30 = 151. June 1 is day 152. So June 1 is day 152. Now, day 1 is Sunday. So day 152 is what day of the week? 152 divided by 7 is 21 weeks (147 days) and 5 days. So 147 days is 21 weeks, so day 147 is Sunday. Then day 148 is Monday, 149 Tuesday, 150 Wednesday, 151 Thursday, 152 Friday. So June 1 is Friday. Therefore, June 1 is Friday. Then June 26 is 25 days later. 25 days is 3 weeks (21 days) and 4 days. So Friday + 4 days is Tuesday. Therefore, June 26 is Tuesday. But earlier, when I thought that July 4 is Monday, and June 26 is 8 days before July 4, that would be Sunday. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, if July 1 is Friday (day 152 + 30 days (June has 30 days) + 1 day (July 1) = day 152 + 30 = 182? Wait, no. Wait, June 1 is day 152. June has 30 days, so June 30 is day 152 + 29 = 181. Then July 1 is day 182. So day 182 is July 1. If day 182 is Friday, then July 4 is day 182 + 3 = 185. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks (182) and 3 days. So day 182 is Friday, day 183 is Saturday, 184 Sunday, 185 Monday. So July 4 is Monday. That's correct. Then June 26 is 8 days before July 4. So July 4 is day 185. Subtract 8 days: 185 - 8 = 177. So day 177 is June 26. What day is day 177? Let's calculate. 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks (175) and 2 days. So day 175 is Sunday (since day 1 is Sunday). Then day 176 is Monday, day 177 is Tuesday. Therefore, June 26 is Tuesday. So that matches the previous calculation. So why did I think earlier that June 26 was Sunday? Because I thought that June 26 was 8 days before July 4, which is Monday. But if July 4 is Monday, then June 26 is 8 days before, which would be 8 days before Monday. Let's count backwards: July 4 (Monday) minus 1 day is July 3 (Sunday), minus 2 is July 2 (Saturday), minus 3 is July 1 (Friday), minus 4 is June 30 (Thursday), minus 5 is June 29 (Wednesday), minus 6 is June 28 (Tuesday), minus 7 is June 27 (Monday), minus 8 is June 26 (Sunday). Wait, that's conflicting. But according to the day count, day 177 is Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. If July 4 is day 185, then June 26 is day 177. But when I count backwards from July 4, I must have made a mistake. Let me check again. July 4 is day 185. Let's count backwards 8 days:\n\nJuly 4 (185) - 1 = July 3 (184) - 2 = July 2 (183) - 3 = July 1 (182) - 4 = June 30 (181) - 5 = June 29 (180) - 6 = June 28 (179) - 7 = June 27 (178) - 8 = June 26 (177). So June 26 is day 177. Now, day 177 is Tuesday. But when I count backwards from July 4 (Monday), I thought that June 26 would be Sunday. But that's wrong. Because when I count backwards, I must have made a mistake in the days. Let me check the days again. If July 1 is Friday (day 182), then July 2 is Saturday (183), July 3 is Sunday (184), July 4 is Monday (185). Then June 30 is Thursday (181), June 29 is Wednesday (180), June 28 is Tuesday (179), June 27 is Monday (178), June 26 is Sunday (177)? Wait, but according to the day count, day 177 is Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. What's the problem?\n\nWait, day 177 is June 26.

Wait, if you start on July 31, then August has 31 days, so from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September has 30 days, so from August 31 to September 30 is 30 days. Then October 1 is 1 day, and October 2 is another day. Wait, but that would be 31 (July 31 to August 31) + 30 (September) + 2 (October 1 and 2) = 63 days? Wait, but that can't be right.

No, that's getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that July 31 is day 1, then August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, no. Wait, if July 31 is day 1, then August 1 is day 2, August 2 is day 3, etc. So August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 1 + 31 = 32. Then September has 30 days, so September 30 is day 32 + 30 = 62. Then October 1 is day 63, October 2 is day 64. So total days from July 31 to October 2 inclusive is 64 days. Wait, that seems right.

Wait, if July 31 is day 1, then August 1 is day 2, August 2 is day 3, ..., August 31 is day 32. Then September 1 is day 33, and so on. So September 30 is day 32 + 30 = 62. Then October 1 is day 63, October 2 is day 64. So total days is 64. So that's 64 days in total.\n\nNow, the problem is to count the number of weekdays (Monday-Friday) in these 64 days, including both start and end dates. The start date is Sunday, July 31, and the end date is Sunday, October 2.\n\nSo, the first day is Sunday. Let's list the days of the week for each date. Let's start from July 31 (Sunday) and go up to October 2 (Sunday). Let's see:\n\nJuly 31: Sunday (start)\nAugust 1: Monday\nAugust 2: Tuesday\nAugust 3: Wednesday\nAugust 4: Thursday\nAugust 5: Friday\nAugust 6: Saturday\nAugust 7: Sunday\nAugust 8: Monday\n... and so on.\n\nSo, each week has 5 weekdays (Monday-Friday) and 2 weekends (Saturday and Sunday). But since the total number of days is 64, which is 9 weeks and 1 day (since 7*9=63, so 64 is 63 +1). Wait, 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. So 9 weeks is 63 days, plus 1 day. So that would mean that there are 9 full weeks and one extra day.\n\nIn each full week, there are 5 weekdays. So 9 weeks would have 9*5=45 weekdays. Then the extra day is the 64th day, which is October 2, which is a Sunday. So that day is a weekend. Therefore, the total weekdays would be 45 + 0 (since the extra day is a weekend) = 45? But wait, wait. Wait, the first day is Sunday (July 31), which is a weekend. Then the next day is Monday (August 1), which is a weekday. So in the first week (July 31 to August 7), there are 7 days. Let's check:\n\nJuly 31: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 1: Monday (weekday)\nAugust 2: Tuesday (weekday)\nAugust 3: Wednesday (weekday)\nAugust 4: Thursday (weekday)\nAugust 5: Friday (weekday)\nAugust 6: Saturday (weekend)\nAugust 7: Sunday (weekend)\n\nSo in this first week, there are 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri) and 2 weekends (Sun and Sat). So that's 5 weekdays. Then the next week (August 8 to August 14) would be the same. So each week has 5 weekdays. So 9 weeks would be 45 weekdays. But wait, the total days are 64, which is 9 weeks (63 days) plus 1 day. So the 64th day is October 2, which is a Sunday. So that day is a weekend. Therefore, the total weekdays would be 45. But wait, but the first day is Sunday, which is a weekend. So in the first week, the first day is Sunday, and the last day of the first week is August 7 (Sunday). Then the next week starts on August 8 (Monday). So the 9 weeks would be from July 31 to August 27 (since 7*9=63 days, so July 31 + 63 days is August 27? Wait, maybe I need to check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check how many weekends are in the 64 days. Since each week has 2 weekends, 9 weeks would have 18 weekend days. Then the extra day is a Sunday, which is another weekend. So total weekends would be 18 + 1 = 19. Therefore, total weekdays would be 64 - 19 = 45. So that's 45 weekdays. But wait, but the start and end dates are both Sundays. So maybe that's correct. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between July 31 and October 2.\n\nFirst, July 31 is Sunday. So the next day is Monday, August 1. Let's find the first Monday, which is August 1. Then the last day is October 2, which is Sunday. Let's find the last Friday before October 2. October 2 is Sunday, so the previous Friday is September 30. Wait, September 30 is a Friday? Let me check. Wait, August 1 is Monday. Let's check the days for August.\n\nAugust 1: Monday\nAugust 2: Tuesday\nAugust 3: Wednesday\nAugust 4: Thursday\nAugust 5: Friday\nAugust 6: Saturday\nAugust 7: Sunday\nAugust 8: Monday\n... and so on.\n\nSo each week cycles. Let's find the number of Mondays. From August 1 to October 2, how many Mondays are there?\n\nWell, August has 31 days. August 1 is Monday. So the Mondays in August are 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Mondays. Then September has 30 days. September 1 is a Saturday (since August 31 is a Sunday, so September 1 is Monday? Wait, wait. Wait, August 31 is a Sunday. So September 1 is Monday. Wait, August 1 is Monday, August 7 is Sunday, August 8 is Monday. So August 31 is Sunday. Then September 1 is Monday. So September 1 is Monday. Then the Mondays in September are 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Mondays. Then October 1 is Monday. October 2 is Sunday. So in October, the Mondays would be October 1 (but October 2 is Sunday, so October 1 is Monday, but October 2 is the end date. So October 1 is a Monday, but October 2 is Sunday. So in October, there is one Monday (October 1). So total Mondays: 5 (August) + 5 (September) + 1 (October) = 11 Mondays.\n\nSimilarly, Tuesdays: August 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (August has 31 days, so August 30 is Tuesday). Then September 1 is Monday, so September 2 is Tuesday. So September 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5 Tuesdays. Then October 1 is Monday, so October 2 is Sunday. So October has no Tuesdays. So total Tuesdays: 5 +5 = 10? Wait, August 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5), September 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5), and October has none. So total 10 Tuesdays.\n\nWait, but wait, August 30 is Tuesday. Then September 1 is Monday, so September 2 is Tuesday. So September 2 is Tuesday. Then September 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5. So total 5+5=10. Correct.\n\nWednesdays: August 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 (August 31 is Wednesday? Wait, August 31 is Sunday. Wait, August 3 is Wednesday. August 10 is Wednesday. August 17, 24, 31. Wait, August 31 is Sunday. So August 31 is Sunday. So August 24 is Wednesday. Then August 24 + 7 is August 31, which is Sunday. So August 31 is Sunday. So August 24 is Wednesday. Then September 1 is Monday. So September 1 is Monday, so September 2 is Tuesday, September 3 is Wednesday. So September 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. That's 5 Wednesdays. Then October has no Wednesdays. So total Wednesdays: 5 (August) + 5 (September) = 10.\n\nThursdays: August 4, 11, 18, 25. Then September 1 is Monday, so September 2 is Tuesday, September 3 is Wednesday, September 4 is Thursday. So September 4, 11, 18, 25. Then October 2 is Sunday. So October has no Thursdays. So August has 4 Thursdays (August 4, 11, 18, 25). Then September has 4 Thursdays (September 4, 11, 18, 25). So total 4 +4 = 8 Thursdays.\n\nWait, but wait, August has 31 days. August 4 is Thursday. Then August 11, 18, 25. Then August 25 +7 is September 1, which is Monday. So September 1 is Monday. So September 4 is Thursday. Then September 11, 18, 25. Then September 25 +7 is October 2, which is Sunday. So September 25 is Thursday. So that's 4 Thursdays in September. So total 4+4=8.\n\nFridays: August 5, 12, 19, 26. Then September 1 is Monday, so September 2 is Tuesday, September 3 is Wednesday, September 4 is Thursday, September 5 is Friday. So September 5, 12, 19, 26. Then October 2 is Sunday. So October has no Fridays. So August has 4 Fridays (August 5, 12, 19, 26). September has 4 Fridays (September 5, 12, 19, 26). So total 4+4=8 Fridays.\n\nSo adding up all the weekdays:\n\nMondays: 11\n\nTuesdays: 10\n\nWednesdays: 10\n\nThursdays: 8\n\nFridays: 8\n\nTotal: 11 +10 +10 +8 +8 = 47?\n\nWait, that's 47. But earlier calculation said 45. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm. So according to the first method, total days 64, subtract 19 weekends (9 weeks * 2 = 18, plus 1 extra day which is Sunday, so 19), 64-19=45. But according to the second method, adding up the weekdays, it's 47. So there's a problem here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check the counts again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of each weekday.\n\nFirst, let's check Mondays. August 1 is Monday. August has 31 days. So Mondays in August: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Mondays. Then September 1 is Monday. So September 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Mondays. Then October 1 is Monday. But October 2 is the end date, so October 1 is included. So that's 1 more Monday. So total 5+5+1=11. That seems correct.\n\nTuesdays: August 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5). September 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5). October has no Tuesdays. So 10. Correct.\n\nWednesdays: August 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. Wait, August 31 is Sunday. Wait, August 3 is Wednesday. August 10, 17, 24. Then August 31 is Sunday. So August 24 +7 is September 1 (Monday). So September 1 is Monday, so September 3 is Wednesday. Then September 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. That's 5. So total 5+5=10. Correct.\n\nThursdays: August 4, 11, 18, 25. Then September 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 4+4=8. Correct.\n\nFridays: August 5, 12, 19, 26. September"], [124, "How many Tuesdays are there from Saturday, October 29, 2022 to Sunday, October 30, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Give the count numerically.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many Tuesdays are there from Saturday, October 29, 2022, to Sunday, October 30, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. So I need to figure out the days of the week for those dates and count how many Tuesdays fall within that range.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week October 29, 2022, was. The user mentioned it's a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think October 29, 2022, was indeed a Saturday. Let me think. If I remember correctly, October 29, 2022, was a Saturday. Then October 30 would be a Sunday. So the period in question is from Saturday the 29th to Sunday the 30th, inclusive. \n\nNow, the question is how many Tuesdays are in that period. Let's list the dates and their corresponding days. \n\nStarting with October 29, 2022: Saturday. Then October 30 is Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. Wait, but the period is inclusive of both dates. So that's two days total. Now, are there any Tuesdays in between? Well, the first day is Saturday, the next day is Sunday. So between those two days, there's no Tuesday. Because the next day after Saturday is Sunday, then Monday, then Tuesday. But the period only includes up to Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, there are zero Tuesdays in that period. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me think again. Let's check the actual days. If October 29 is a Saturday, then October 30 is a Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. So the days in between are only those two. Therefore, there are no Tuesdays. So the answer should be zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's a possibility that the dates could be different. But the user said that the start date is Saturday, October 29, 2022, and the end date is Sunday, October 30, 2022. So that's two days. So the answer is zero Tuesdays. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check the actual calendar. Let me think. For example, if I check an online calendar or use a day calculator. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me recall that October 29, 2022, was a Saturday. So October 30 is Sunday. Therefore, the two days are Saturday and Sunday. So no Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n</think>", "0"], [124, "Between Saturday, April 9, 2022 and Friday, July 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Friday occur? Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many Fridays there are between April 9, 2022 (Saturday) and July 1, 2022 (Friday), inclusive. Hmm. So first, I should find out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many weeks and extra days there are, which would tell me the number of Fridays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates or find the first and last day of the period and then calculate. Let me start by checking the starting date. April 9, 2022 is a Saturday. So the first day is Saturday. The last day is July 1, 2022, which is a Friday. So the period starts on a Saturday and ends on a Friday. That's important because the number of Fridays depends on how the days fall in between.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total number of days between April 9 and July 1, inclusive. Let me break it down month by month. April has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 inclusive is 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have April 9 to April 30, that's 30 - 9 = 21 days, plus 1 for the inclusive count. So 22 days. Then May has 31 days, and June has 30 days. Then July 1 is the next day. Wait, but the period ends on July 1, so the total days would be April 9 to April 30 (22 days) plus May (31) plus June (30) plus July 1 (1 day). Wait, but that would be 22 + 31 + 30 + 1? Wait, no. Wait, April 9 to April 30 is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that. Then June has 30 days. Then July 1 is one day. Wait, but if the period is from April 9 to July 1 inclusive, then the total days would be (April 9 to April 30) + May + June + July 1. Wait, but April 9 to April 30 is 22 days. Then May is 31 days, June is 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. So total days would be 22 + 31 + 30 + 1? Wait, that seems like 22 + 31 is 53, plus 30 is 83, plus 1 is 84. But that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm adding extra days. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total days from April 9 to July 1 inclusive. Let's think of it as the number of days from April 9 to July 1. Let me check the actual dates. April has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 = 21 days, but since both ends are inclusive, it's 21 + 1 = 22 days. Then May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. So total days would be 22 + 31 + 30 + 1? Wait, that would be 22 + 31 is 53, plus 30 is 83, plus 1 is 84. But that seems like 84 days. Wait, but maybe that's correct. Let me check with another method. Let's see, April 9 to April 10 is 2 days. So April 9 to April 30 is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 22 + 31 = 53. Then June has 30 days, so 53 + 30 = 83. Then July 1 is one day, so 83 + 1 = 84. So total 84 days. So the total number of days is 84. \n\nNow, since there are 7 days in a week, 84 divided by 7 is exactly 12 weeks. So that would mean there are 12 Fridays. But wait, because the period starts on a Saturday (April 9) and ends on a Friday (July 1). So if there are exactly 12 weeks, then each day of the week occurs exactly 12 times. But wait, that would mean 12 Fridays. But wait, let me check. Because if the first day is Saturday, then the first Friday would be April 8, but since the period starts on April 9, which is Saturday, then the first Friday in the period is April 10? Wait, no. Wait, April 9 is Saturday. So April 10 is Sunday, April 11 is Monday, April 12 is Tuesday, April 13 is Wednesday, April 14 is Thursday, April 15 is Friday. So the first Friday in the period is April 15. Then each subsequent Friday is 7 days later. So if the total number of days is 84, which is exactly 12 weeks, then the last day is Friday, July 1. So the first Friday is April 15, and the last is July 1. So how many Fridays are there? Well, 12 weeks would mean 12 Fridays. But let me check with actual dates. Let's count the number of Fridays in each month.\n\nApril: April 15, 22, 29. That's three Fridays. Then May has 31 days. May 1 is a Sunday (since April 15 is Friday, April 16 is Saturday, April 17 is Sunday. Wait, wait, April 15 is Friday. Then April 16 is Saturday, April 17 is Sunday. So May 1 is April 17 + 15 days? Wait, April has 30 days. April 15 is Friday. April 16 is Saturday, April 17 is Sunday. Then April 24 is Sunday, April 25 is Monday, April 26 is Tuesday, April 27 is Wednesday, April 28 is Thursday, April 29 is Friday, April 30 is Saturday. So May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May has 31 days. So the first Friday in May is May 2 (since May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Sunday. So May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday. So the first Friday in May is May 6. Then each week after that. So May has 31 days. So the number of Fridays in May would be 31 divided by 7. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 Fridays plus one more if the remaining days include Friday. Since May 6 is the first Friday, then the next ones are 13, 20, 27. Then May 31 is the 31st day. May 31 is a Saturday (since May 27 is Friday, then 28 is Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, May 6 is Friday. Then May 13 is Friday, 20, 27. Then May 27 + 7 is June 3. So May 31 is 4 days after May 27. So May 27 is Friday, May 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. So May has 4 Fridays (6,13,20,27). Then June has 30 days. June 1 is Wednesday (since May 31 is Tuesday, June 1 is Wednesday). So June 1 is Wednesday. Then the first Friday in June is June 3. Then 10, 17, 24, 31. Wait, June has 30 days. So June 31 is not there. So June 31 is the 30th day. So June 31 is Friday? Wait, June 3 is Friday. Then June 10 is Friday, 17, 24, 31. But June only has 30 days. So June 31 is not a real date. So the last Friday in June is June 24. Then June has 4 Fridays (3,10,17,24). Then July 1 is Friday. So July 1 is the fifth Friday in July. Wait, but July 1 is the end of the period. So in July, there's only one Friday (July 1). So adding up: April has 3, May 4, June 4, July 1. Total is 3+4+4+1=12. So that's 12 Fridays. So that matches the 12 weeks. So the answer is 12. Therefore, the answer is 12.\n</think>", "12"], [124, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

Let me check what day January 16, 2022, was. Wait, October 24, 2022, is a Monday. Let me check January 16, 2022. Let me think. January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So January 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday. So January 3 is a Monday. Then January 16 would be 13 days later. 13 divided by 7 is 1 week and 6 days.

So perhaps the user intended to write January 16, 2023. But since the user wrote 2022, maybe I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe the user is correct, but the dates are in the same year. Wait, October is the 10th month, and January is the 1st. So October 24 is before January 16 in the same year? No, that's not possible. So the period from October 24 to January 16 in the same year would be going backward. Therefore, the user must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. Let me check that. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check the day of the week for January 16, 2023. January 1, 2023, is a Sunday. So January 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, 3 is Tuesday, 4 is Wednesday, 5 is Thursday, 6 is Friday, 7 is Saturday, 8 is Sunday. Then January 16 would be 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Sunday (Jan 1) would be Monday. So January 16, 2023, is a Monday. So if the user intended to write January 16, 2023, then that would make sense. But the user wrote 2022. So maybe that's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user is correct, but the dates are in the same year. But that's impossible. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the question. However, since the user is asking, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the end date is January 16, 2023. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, but that's not possible. Therefore, I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe the user is correct, and the dates are in the same year. Wait, but October is before January. So October 24 is before January 16 in the same year. Wait, no. Wait, October is the 10th month, and January is the 1st. So October 24 is in the 10th month, and January 16 is in the 1st month. So October 24 is earlier than January 16 in the same year. Wait, no. Wait, October is the 10th month, so October 24 is in the 10th month, and January is the 1st month. So October 24 is in the year 2022, and January 16 is also in 2022. But October is after January. Wait, no. Wait, the months are ordered as January (1), February (2), ..., October (10), November (11), December (12). So October is after January. Therefore, October 24 is later in the year than January 16. Therefore, the period from October 24 to January 16 would be going backward in time. Therefore, the user must have made a mistake. Therefore, the correct period should be from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. But the user wrote the opposite. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. So I think that's the case. Therefore, I'll proceed with that assumption. So the period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. Now, I need to calculate the number of business days between these two dates, inclusive. So first, I need to find the total number of days between these two dates, then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, I can count the number of business days directly. Let me first calculate the total number of days between October 24, 2022, and January 16, 2023. Let's break it down month by month. October 24 to October 31: October has 31 days. So from October 24 to October 31 is 31 - 24 = 7 days. But since October 24 is included, that's 8 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on October 24, then October 24 is day 1, October 25 is day 2, ..., October 31 is day 8. So that's 8 days. Then November has 30 days. December has 31 days. Then January 1 to January 16 is 16 days. So total days from October 24 to January 16 is 8 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 16 (January) = 8 + 30 is 38, plus 31 is 69, plus 16 is 85 days. Wait, but that's the total days between October 24 and January 16 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on October 24, then add 8 days to get to October 31. Then November has 30 days, so adding 30 days. Then December has 31 days. Then January 1 to 16 is 16 days. So total days is 8 + 30 + 31 + 16 = 85 days. But wait, that's the total number of days from October 24 to January 16 inclusive. Wait, but if you start on October 24 and end on January 16, then the total days would be (October 24 to October 31) is 8 days, then November (30), December (31), and January 1-16 (16). So 8+30+31+16=85 days. So total days is 85. Now, from that, we need to subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays). So how many weekends are there in this period? Let's find the number of Saturdays and Sundays between October 24, 2022, and January 16, 2023. First, let's check the starting day. October 24, 2022, is a Monday. So October 24 is Monday. Then October 25 is Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So October has 31 days. So October 24 is Monday, October 29 is Saturday, October 30 is Sunday, October 31 is Monday. Then November 1 is Tuesday. So November has 30 days. Let's count the number of weekends in each month. October: October 24 is Monday. The weekends in October are October 29 (Saturday) and 30 (Sunday). So that's 2 days. Then November: November has 30 days. Let's find the first day of November. November 1 is Tuesday. So the weekends in November are the 3rd (Saturday), 4th (Sunday), 10th (Saturday), 11th (Sunday), 17th (Saturday), 18th (Sunday), 24th (Saturday), 25th (Sunday), 31st (Saturday). Wait, November has 30 days, so November 30 is a Wednesday. Wait, let me check. November 1 is Tuesday. So November 1 is Tuesday. Then November 2 is Wednesday, 3 is Thursday, 4 is Friday, 5 is Saturday, 6 is Sunday. Wait, no. Wait, November 1 is Tuesday. So November 1: Tuesday, 2: Wednesday, 3: Thursday, 4: Friday, 5: Saturday, 6: Sunday. Then November 7 is Tuesday again. So the weekends in November are 5 (Saturday), 6 (Sunday), 12 (Saturday), 13 (Sunday), 19 (Saturday), 20 (Sunday), 26 (Saturday), 27 (Sunday). Wait, November 26 is Saturday, 27 Sunday. Then November 30 is Wednesday. So that's 8 weekends in November. So 8 days. Then December has 31 days. December 1 is Thursday (since November 30 is Wednesday, so December 1 is Thursday). Let's check. November 30 is Wednesday. So December 1 is Thursday. Then December 2 is Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday. Then December 5 is Monday. So the weekends in December are 3 (Saturday), 4 (Sunday), 10 (Saturday), 11 (Sunday), 17 (Saturday), 18 (Sunday), 24 (Saturday), 25 (Sunday), 31 (Saturday). So that's 9 weekends in December. Then January 1 is Sunday (since December 31 is Saturday). Wait, December 31 is Saturday. So January 1 is Sunday. Then January 2 is Monday, 3 Tuesday, 4 Wednesday, 5 Thursday, 6 Friday, 7 Saturday, 8 Sunday. So the weekends in January are 1 (Sunday), 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday), 14 (Saturday), 15 (Sunday), 21 (Saturday), 22 (Sunday), 28 (Saturday), 29 (Sunday). But the period ends on January 16. So January 16 is a Monday. So in January, the weekends are January 1 (Sunday), 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday), 14 (Saturday), 15 (Sunday). So that's 5 weekends in January. So total weekends: October 2, November 8, December 9, January 5. Total is 2 + 8 + 9 + 5 = 24 days. So total weekends are 24 days. Therefore, the total business days would be total days (85) minus weekends (24) = 61 days. But wait, let me check again. Wait, October has 2 weekends (29 and 30). November has 8 weekends. December has 9 weekends. January has 5 weekends. So 2+8=10, 10+9=19, 19+5=24. Yes. So 24 weekends. So 85 total days minus 24 weekends is 61 business days. But wait, the user said the end date is January 16, 2022. But that's not possible. So if the user made a mistake and the end date is January 16, 2023, then the answer is 61. But if the user intended the dates to be in the same year, then the period is invalid. However, since the user wrote both dates as 2022, but that's impossible, I think the correct answer is 61. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should check the actual dates again. Wait, if the user intended the dates to be from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, then that's a negative period. So that's not possible. Therefore, the user must have made a mistake. Therefore, the correct answer is 61 business days. But I need to confirm the total days again. Let me recount the total days. October 24 to October 31: 8 days (including both). November has 30 days. December has 31 days. January 1 to 16 is 16 days. So 8 + 30 + 31 + 16 = 85 days. Yes. Then subtract 24 weekends. 85 - 24 = 61. So the answer is 61. But wait, the user said \"inclusive of both dates\". So that's correct. So the answer is 61. But I need to make sure that the weekends are correctly counted. Let me check again. October: 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun) \u2192 2 days. November: 5,6,12,13,19,20,26,27 \u2192 8 days. December: 3,4,10,11,17,18,24,25,31 \u2192 9 days. January: 1,7,8,14,15 \u2192 5 days. Total 2+8+9+5=24. Yes. So 85-24=61. Therefore, the answer is 61.\n</think>", "61"], [124, "On which weekday did October 1, 2022 fall? Reply with just the weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022 fell on. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yes, that makes sense. So 2022 started on a Sunday.\n\nNow, October 1 is the 274th day of the year. Wait, how do I calculate that? Let me count the days. January has 31 days, February 28 (since 2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30. So adding those up:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\n\nSo October 1 is the 274th day. So if January 1 is a Sunday, then adding 273 days would get me to September 30, which would be a Saturday. Then October 1 would be a Sunday? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if January 1 is Sunday, then January 2 is Monday, and so on. So each day, adding 1 day. So if September 30 is 273 days after January 1, then 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks exactly. So 273 days is exactly 39 weeks, so September 30 would be the same day as January 1, which is Sunday. Therefore, October 1 would be the next day, Monday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let me think of some known dates. For example, I know that October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Because I remember that October 1, 2020 was a Friday, and 2020 was a leap year, so 2021 started on a Saturday. Wait, no. Wait, 2020 started on a Wednesday. Wait, maybe I need to check again. Let me try to recall. Wait, maybe I should use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 1, 2022 is a certain day. Wait, but I need to figure it out. Let me check another way. Let's take a date I know. For example, October 1, 2022. Wait, I think that's a Saturday. Wait, but I need to verify. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then, let's count the days from January 1 to October 1. Let's see:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so January 1 is day 1 (Sunday). Then, February has 28 days, so February 28 is day 31 + 28 = 59. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 59 + 31 = 90. April has 30 days, so April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120. May has 31 days, so May 31 is 120 + 31 = 151. June has 30 days, so June 30 is 151 + 30 = 181. July has 31 days, so July 31 is 181 + 31 = 212. August has 31 days, so August 31 is 212 + 31 = 243. September has 30 days, so September 30 is 243 + 30 = 273. Therefore, October 1 is day 274. \n\nNow, since January 1 is a Sunday, day 1 is Sunday. Then day 274 is 273 days later. 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks exactly. So 273 days is 39 weeks, so day 274 would be the same as day 1, which is Sunday. Wait, that would mean October 1 is a Sunday. But that contradicts my previous thought where I thought October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me check. If 2021 started on a Saturday, then 2022 would start on a Sunday. Then October 1, 2022 would be 365 days later. Wait, but 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if October 1, 2021 was a Saturday, then October 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. That matches the previous calculation. So that would mean that October 1, 2022 is a Sunday. But I thought earlier that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I was wrong. Let me check another way. \n\nAlternatively, I can check online. Wait, but since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But according to the calculation here, it's a Sunday. Which is correct? Let me think again. \n\nWait, if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then January 1, 2023 is a Sunday again? No, because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023 would be a Monday. So that's correct. \n\nNow, if October 1, 2022 is day 274, which is 273 days after January 1. 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks. So that would mean that October 1 is the same day as January 1, which is Sunday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is a Sunday. But I thought earlier that October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If October 1, 2021 was a Saturday, then October 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. That's correct. So that seems to check out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, November 4, 2022. I know that November 4, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, but how? Let me think. If October 1 is a Sunday, then October 8 is a Sunday. Then October 15, 22, 29 are Sundays. November 5 is a Sunday. So November 4 would be a Saturday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the day of the week for a specific date that I know. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday. Let me count. July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. That's correct. Now, if July 1 is Friday, then July 1 is day 182 (since January 1 is day 1, and up to June 30 is 181 days). So day 182 is July 1. Then, day 182 is Friday. Then, day 274 is October 1. The difference between day 274 and day 182 is 92 days. 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Friday would be Saturday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, this is confusing. \n\nWait, if July 1 is Friday (day 182), then day 182 is Friday. Then day 182 + 92 = day 274. So 92 days later. 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 13 weeks later is the same day, plus 1 day. So Friday + 1 day is Saturday. Therefore, October 1 would be a Saturday. But earlier calculation said that October 1 is day 274, which is 273 days after January 1 (Sunday), which is 39 weeks, so same day. But this contradicts. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a mistake here. Because if July 1 is day 182, and January 1 is day 1, then the difference between day 182 and day 1 is 181 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then day 182 is 181 days later. 181 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 6 days. So 25 weeks is 175 days, so 181 - 175 = 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. Therefore, July 1 is a Saturday. But earlier I thought July 4 was a Monday. Wait, if July 1 is a Saturday, then July 4 is a Tuesday. But I thought July 4 was a Monday. That's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh, here's the problem. I must have made a mistake in the day count. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to July 1. January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30. So up to June 30 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181. So June 30 is day 181. Therefore, July 1 is day 182. So if January 1 is Sunday, then day 182 is 181 days later. 181 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 6 days. So 25 weeks is 175 days, so 181-175=6 days. Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. So July 1 is Saturday. Then July 4 is 3 days later, which would be Tuesday. But I thought July 4 was a Monday. That's conflicting. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 is a Monday. Because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then January 1, 2023 is a Monday. That's correct. Now, if January 1, 2023 is a Monday, then January 1, 2022 is a Sunday. So that's correct. Now, if July 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then July 4 is Tuesday. But I thought July 4 was a Monday. Wait, maybe I was wrong. Let me check another date. For example, July 1, 2022. Let me think of another way. If July 1 is Saturday, then July 8 is Saturday, July 15, 22, 29. August 5 is Saturday. August 5 is day 227 (since July has 31 days, so July 1 is day 182, July 31 is day 213, August 1 is 214, so August 5 is 214 + 4 = 218. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I need to recount. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. For example, I know that October 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, but according to the previous calculation, if July 1 is Saturday, then July 4 is Tuesday. But if July 4 is Tuesday, then July 1 is Saturday. Let me check that. July 1 is Saturday, July 2 is Sunday, July 3 is Monday, July 4 is Tuesday. That's correct. So if July 4 is Tuesday, then that's correct. But I thought that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I confused it with another year. For example, in 2021, July 4 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the day of the week for a specific date that I know. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If December 25 is Sunday, then December 25 is day 360 (since November has 30 days, so October has 31, November 30, so October 1 is day 274, October 31 is 274 + 30 = 304, November 30 is 304 + 30 = 334, December 1 is 335, December 25 is 335 + 24 = 359. Wait, so December 25 is day 359. If January 1 is Sunday, then day 359 is 358 days later. 358 divided by 7 is 51 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 1 day is Monday. But I thought December 25 was a Sunday. That's conflicting. So there's a problem here. \n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. So where is the mistake? Let me check again. If December 25, 2022 is a Sunday, then day 359 is Sunday. So day 1 (January 1) is Sunday minus 358 days. 358 divided by 7 is 51 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday minus 1 day is Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where January 1, 2023 is a Monday. Because if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023 would be Sunday. But I thought that January 1, 2023 is a Monday. So that's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong about January 1, 2023. Let me check. If January 1, 2023 is a Monday, then 2022 started on Sunday. But if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then 2023 starts on Sunday. So which is correct? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let me check the actual day of the week for a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 is a leap year, so 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days later, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Then 2022 is not a leap year, so January 1, 2023 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. That matches the previous calculation. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, my initial assumption that it was Sunday was wrong. \n\nSo that changes everything. So if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then day 1 is Saturday. Then day 274 is October 1. Let's calculate that. 274 days after January 1. 274 divided by 7 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So 39 weeks is 273 days, so day 274 is 1 day after Saturday, which is Sunday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is a Sunday. But earlier, when I thought that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday, that led to a contradiction. Let me check that again. \n\nIf January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then December 25, 2022 is day"], [124, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Wednesday, September 21 to Wednesday, November 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Respond with just the number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Saturdays fall between Wednesday, September 21, 2022, and Wednesday, November 30, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out the dates and then check each Saturday in that range.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all the dates. Let me think. The total number of days between the two dates, then divide by 7 and adjust for the start and end days. But I need to make sure that the start and end dates are included. Let me check the dates first.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the start and end dates. The start is Wednesday, September 21, 2022. The end is Wednesday, November 30, 2022. So I need to count all Saturdays from September 21 to November 30, inclusive.\n\nLet me check what day of the week each of these dates is. Wait, the start date is a Wednesday. So September 21 is a Wednesday. Then, the next Saturday would be September 24, 2022. Then every 7 days after that. Let me check the dates step by step.\n\nBut maybe I should calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then see how many weeks there are. Let's calculate the total days. Let's break it down into months.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (since 30 - 21 = 9, plus 1 day for inclusive). Then October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. But the end date is November 30, so that's included. So total days from September 21 to November 30 is:\n\nSeptember: 30 - 21 + 1 = 10 days (since inclusive)\nOctober: 31 days\nNovember: 30 days\nTotal days = 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again. From September 21 to September 30 inclusive is 10 days (21,22,...,30). Then October has 31 days, so adding that gives 10 + 31 = 41. Then November has 30 days, so 41 + 30 = 71. So total 71 days.\n\nNow, if there are 71 days in total, then the number of weeks is 71 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7*10=70, so 71 days is 10 weeks and 1 day. So that would mean there are 10 full weeks, which would have 10 Saturdays. But since the start date is a Wednesday, the first day of the period is Wednesday. So the first Saturday is the 3rd day (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). So the first Saturday is day 3. Then each week after that adds another Saturday. But since the total days are 71, which is 10 weeks and 1 day. So the last day is a Wednesday (since the start is Wednesday, adding 70 days (10 weeks) would bring us back to Wednesday, then adding 1 day would be Thursday. Wait, but the end date is November 30, which is a Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe my calculation of total days is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total days. Let me check again. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check what day of the week November 30, 2022 is. Wait, the start date is Wednesday, September 21. Let me check if that's correct. Let me check an online calendar or use a date calculator. But since I can't do that, maybe I can calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the number of days between the two dates. Let me think. Let's check the number of days from September 21 to November 30.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (inclusive). Then October has 31 days, November has 30 days. So total days is 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. So that's correct. So 71 days. Now, if the start date is Wednesday, September 21, then adding 70 days (10 weeks) would bring us to Wednesday, September 21 + 70 days. Let's see: 70 days is 10 weeks. So September 21 + 70 days is September 21 + 70 days. Let's calculate that. September has 30 days, so 30 - 21 = 9 days remaining in September. So adding 70 days: 9 days in September, then 31 days in October (total 40 days), then 30 days in November (total 70 days). So September 21 + 70 days is November 30. Wait, that's correct. So November 30 is exactly 70 days after September 21. But the end date is November 30, which is included. So the total days from September 21 to November 30 inclusive is 71 days. Wait, but if September 21 is day 1, then adding 70 days would be day 71. So that's correct. So the total days is 71. So the period is 71 days long.\n\nNow, since the start date is a Wednesday, the first day is Wednesday. The next Saturday is 3 days later. Then each week after that. So the first Saturday is day 3 (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). Then the next Saturday is day 3 + 7 = 10, then 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66, 73. Wait, but the total days are 71. So the last Saturday would be day 66 (since 66 + 7 = 73, which is beyond 71). So how many Saturdays are there?\n\nLet me list them:\n\nFirst Saturday: day 3 (Sep 24)\nThen day 10 (Sep 24 + 7 days = Sep 31? Wait, wait. Wait, September 21 is day 1. Then day 3 is September 23? Wait, no. Wait, if September 21 is day 1, then day 2 is September 22, day 3 is September 23, day 4 is September 24. Wait, that's not right. Wait, if the first day is September 21 (Wednesday), then day 1 is Wednesday. Then day 2 is Thursday, day 3 is Friday, day 4 is Saturday. So the first Saturday is day 4. Wait, that's a mistake in my previous calculation. Oh no! I think I messed up the day count. So the first Saturday is the 4th day. So that's September 24, 2022. Then the next Saturday is day 4 + 7 = 11 (September 24 + 7 days is October 1, 2022). Wait, but September has 30 days. So September 21 is day 1. Then September 24 is day 4. Then adding 7 days would be day 11, which is September 24 + 7 days = October 1. Wait, but September has 30 days. So September 24 is day 4. Then September 25 is day 5, 26 day 6, 27 day 7, 28 day 8, 29 day 9, 30 day 10. Then October 1 is day 11. So that's correct. So the first Saturday is day 4 (Sep 24), then day 11 (Oct 1), day 18 (Oct 8), day 25 (Oct 15), day 32 (Oct 22), day 39 (Oct 29), day 46 (Nov 5), day 53 (Nov 12), day 60 (Nov 19), day 67 (Nov 26). Then the next Saturday would be day 74 (Dec 3), but that's beyond the end date of November 30. So how many Saturdays are there in total?\n\nLet me count the days:\n\nDay 4: Sep 24\n\nDay 11: Oct 1\n\nDay 18: Oct 8\n\nDay 25: Oct 15\n\nDay 32: Oct 22\n\nDay 39: Oct 29\n\nDay 46: Nov 5\n\nDay 53: Nov 12\n\nDay 60: Nov 19\n\nDay 67: Nov 26\n\nThat's 10 Saturdays. Then the next one would be day 74, which is December 3, which is outside the range. So total of 10 Saturdays. But wait, the total days are 71. So day 71 is November 30. So the last Saturday is day 67 (Nov 26). Then day 67 + 7 = 74, which is beyond. So that's 10 Saturdays. But wait, let me check if the end date is a Wednesday. Because the start date is Wednesday, September 21. Adding 70 days (10 weeks) would be November 30, which is a Wednesday. So the end date is a Wednesday. So the last day of the period is Wednesday. So the last Saturday is Nov 26, which is 67 days from the start. Then the next Saturday would be Dec 3, which is outside. So that's 10 Saturdays. But wait, let me check if there's another Saturday in November. Let's check November. November 30 is a Wednesday. So November 26 is a Saturday. Then November 27 is Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday. So yes, only one Saturday in November. So that's correct. So the count is 10. But wait, let me check again. Let me list all the Saturdays:\n\nSeptember: 24 (Sep 24), then October 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 6 Saturdays in September and October. Then November 5, 12, 19, 26. That's 4 more. Total 6 + 4 = 10. Yes. So the answer is 10. But wait, wait. Wait, September 24 is the first Saturday. Then October has 5 Saturdays (1, 8, 15, 22, 29). That's 5. Then November has 4 (5, 12, 19, 26). So 5 + 4 = 9? Wait, no. Wait, September has one Saturday (24). Then October has 5, November has 4. So total 1 + 5 + 4 = 10. Yes. So that's correct. So the answer is 10. But wait, maybe I should check if September 24 is included. Since the start date is September 21 (Wednesday), and the end date is November 30 (Wednesday). So September 24 is within the range. So yes, that's included. So the answer is 10. Therefore, the number of Saturdays is 10.\n</think>", "10"], [124, "In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. I need to figure out what day of the week April 3rd falls on. Alright, let's start by breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I know that January has 31 days. So, if January 1st is a Tuesday, then I can calculate the day of the week for each subsequent date in January. Then, I can move on to February, March, and finally April. But wait, I need to consider whether it's a leap year or not. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. But since the question is about a specific year where January 1st is a Tuesday, maybe I need to assume it's a common year unless told otherwise? Or maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is the same regardless of leap year? Wait, but April 3rd is in the second quarter of the year, so if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days instead of 28. That might affect the calculation. But the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years, so maybe I should assume it's a common year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is the same either way? Hmm, not sure. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a year where Tuesday is January 1st\". It doesn't specify if it's a leap year or not. But since the answer is unique, maybe the leap year status doesn't affect the calculation here. Let me think. Let's proceed with a common year first, and then check if that's correct.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. Let's count the days from January 1st (Tuesday) to April 3rd. Let's break it down month by month.\n\nFirst, January: 31 days. Since January 1 is Tuesday, then January 8th is also Tuesday, and so on. But maybe I need to calculate the number of days from January 1 to April 3, then find the remainder when divided by 7 to find the day of the week.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of days between January 1 and April 3, then take that number modulo 7. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead April 3 is from Tuesday.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total days from January 1 to April 3. Let's see:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days. March has 31 days. Then April 3 is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1 to April 3 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93 days. Wait, but that's from January 1 to April 3 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if I start counting from January 1 as day 1, then January 1 is day 1, January 2 is day 2, etc. So the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 3 days (April 3) minus 1 (since January 1 is day 1) plus the days in the months before. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the total number of days from January 1 to April 3, inclusive. But actually, when calculating the number of days between two dates, if you want to find how many days after January 1 is April 3, you can calculate the total days from January 1 to April 3, then subtract 1 (since January 1 is day 0). Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find how many days after January 1 is April 3, then it's (31 days in Jan) + (28 or 29 in Feb) + (31 in Mar) + 3 days in April. But that would be the total days from January 1 to April 3 inclusive. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 2 is day 2, ..., January 31 is day 31. Then February 1 is day 32, and so on. So April 3 would be day 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93. So April 3 is day 93. Therefore, the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 92 days (since day 1 is January 1, day 2 is January 2, etc., so day 93 is April 3, so the difference is 92 days). Wait, but if I want to find how many days after January 1, then it's 92 days. So if January 1 is Tuesday, then adding 92 days to that date would give me the day of the week for April 3.\n\nBut since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can compute 92 divided by 7, find the remainder, and then add that to Tuesday.\n\nSo 92 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7*13 is 91, so 92 is 7*13 + 1. So the remainder is 1. Therefore, 92 days later is 1 day after Tuesday. So Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday. Therefore, April 3 would be a Wednesday?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 8 is also Tuesday (7 days later). So adding 7 days brings you back to the same day. So if I have 92 days, which is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 13 weeks later is the same day, then 1 day later. So Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday. Therefore, April 3 is Wednesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (assuming common year). So adding 28 days to January 31 would be February 28. Then March has 31 days. So adding 31 days to February 28 would be March 31. Then April 3 is 3 days after March 31. So total days from January 1 to April 3 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. But if January 1 is day 1, then April 3 is day 93. Therefore, the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 92 days. So 92 days later. So 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Tuesday would be Wednesday. So April 3 is Wednesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step for each month.\n\nJanuary 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the days in each month and see what day of the week each month starts on.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Wednesday, January 31 is Thursday. So February 1 is Friday. Wait, because January 31 is Thursday, so February 1 is Friday. Then February has 28 days. So February 28 is 28 days after February 1. Since 28 is 4 weeks, so February 28 is also a Friday. Then March 1 is Saturday. March has 31 days. So March 1 is Saturday. Then March 7 is Saturday, 14, 21, 28. March 29 is Saturday, March 30 is Sunday, March 31 is Monday. Then April 1 is Tuesday. Wait, because March 31 is Monday, so April 1 is Tuesday. Then April 2 is Wednesday, April 3 is Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. Wait, according to this step-by-step, April 3 is Thursday. But earlier calculation said Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. So where is the mistake?\n\nLet me check again. Let's start from January 1 as Tuesday.\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 8: Tuesday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 22: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 29: Tuesday\n\nThen January 30: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 31: Thursday\n\nSo February 1 is Friday. Correct.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So February 28 is 28 days after February 1. Since 28 is 4 weeks, so February 28 is also Friday. Therefore, March 1 is Saturday. Correct.\n\nMarch has 31 days. So March 1 is Saturday. Then March 7 is Saturday, 14, 21, 28. March 28 is Saturday. March 29 is Sunday, March 30 is Monday, March 31 is Tuesday. Wait, wait, that's different from before. Wait, March 1 is Saturday. Then March 1 + 7 days is March 8 (Saturday). March 15 (Saturday), March 22 (Saturday), March 29 (Saturday). Then March 30 is Sunday, March 31 is Monday. So April 1 is Tuesday. Then April 2 is Wednesday, April 3 is Thursday. So according to this, April 3 is Thursday. But earlier calculation said Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, the first method said 92 days later, which is 13 weeks and 1 day. So Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday. But the step-by-step counting says April 3 is Thursday. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nLet me check the total days again. Let's count the days from January 1 to April 3. If January 1 is day 1, then:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So day 31 is January 31.\n\nFebruary has 28 days, so day 31 + 28 = 59 is February 28.\n\nMarch has 31 days, so day 59 + 31 = 90 is March 31.\n\nApril 3 is day 90 + 3 = 93. So April 3 is day 93. Therefore, the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 92 days. So 92 days later. So 92 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 1. So 92 days is 13 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Tuesday, then adding 92 days would be Tuesday + 1 day = Wednesday. But according to the step-by-step, it's Thursday. So why the difference?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the error is in the step-by-step counting. Let me check again. Let's count the days again.\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday.\n\nJanuary 1 + 7 days = January 8: Tuesday.\n\nJanuary 15: Tuesday.\n\nJanuary 22: Tuesday.\n\nJanuary 29: Tuesday.\n\nThen January 30: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 31: Thursday.\n\nFebruary 1: Friday.\n\nFebruary 2: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 3: Sunday.\n\nFebruary 4: Monday.\n\nFebruary 5: Tuesday.\n\nFebruary 6: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 7: Thursday.\n\nFebruary 8: Friday.\n\nFebruary 9: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 10: Sunday.\n\nFebruary 11: Monday.\n\nFebruary 12: Tuesday.\n\nFebruary 13: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 14: Thursday.\n\nFebruary 15: Friday.\n\nFebruary 16: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 17: Sunday.\n\nFebruary 18: Monday.\n\nFebruary 19: Tuesday.\n\nFebruary 20: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 21: Thursday.\n\nFebruary 22: Friday.\n\nFebruary 23: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 24: Sunday.\n\nFebruary 25: Monday.\n\nFebruary 26: Tuesday.\n\nFebruary 27: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 28: Thursday.\n\nSo February 28 is Thursday. Then March 1 is Friday. Wait, but earlier I thought March 1 was Saturday. Wait, that's the mistake! Oh no! So here, February 28 is Thursday, so March 1 is Friday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. March 29 is Friday. March 30 is Saturday, March 31 is Sunday. Then April 1 is Monday. Wait, that's different from before. So April 1 is Monday. Then April 2 is Tuesday, April 3 is Wednesday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous step-by-step. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, earlier when I thought March 1 was Saturday, that was wrong. Because if February 28 is Thursday, then March 1 is Friday. So that's the mistake. So the previous step-by-step was wrong. So let's redo the step-by-step.\n\nLet me start again:\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday.\n\nJanuary 31: Thursday (as before).\n\nFebruary 1: Friday.\n\nFebruary 28: Thursday (since 28 days later, which is 4 weeks, so same day as February 1, which is Friday. Wait, no. Wait, if February 1 is Friday, then adding 28 days (which is 4 weeks) would be February 28, which is also Friday. Wait, but earlier when I counted day by day, I found that February 28 is Thursday. That's conflicting. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if February 1 is Friday, then February 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. Wait, but February has 28 days. So February 28 is 27 days after February 1. Wait, 28 days would be February 28. So if February 1 is Friday, then February 28 is 27 days later. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Friday + 6 days is Thursday. So February 28 is Thursday. Therefore, March 1 is Friday. So that's correct. So earlier when I thought that February 28 was Thursday, that's correct. Then March 1 is Friday. So March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. March 29 is Friday. March 30 is Saturday, March 31 is Sunday. Then April 1 is Monday. So April 1 is Monday. Then April 2 is Tuesday, April 3 is Wednesday. So according to this, April 3 is Wednesday. Which matches the first calculation. So where was the mistake in the previous step-by-step? Oh, I think I had a miscalculation earlier when I thought March 1 was Saturday. That was wrong. So the correct step-by-step shows that April 3 is Wednesday. So that aligns with the first method. Therefore, the correct answer is Wednesday.\n\nBut why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought March 1 was Saturday, but that was incorrect. So the correct way is to count the days properly. So the first method was correct. So the answer is Wednesday.\n\nBut let me check again with another approach. Let's use the fact that January 1 is Tuesday. Let's find the day of the week for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 31 is 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Tuesday + 2 days is Thursday. So January 31 is Thursday. Then February 1 is Friday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days later. 28 is 4 weeks, so same day as February 1, which is Friday. So March 1 is Saturday. Wait, but earlier calculation said March 1 is Friday. Wait, now I'm confused again. Wait, if February 28 is Friday, then March 1 is Saturday. But earlier when I counted day by day, I found that February 28 is Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me check again. If February 1 is Friday, then February 28 is 27 days later. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Friday + 6 days is Thursday. So February 28 is Thursday. Therefore, March 1 is Friday. But according to the other approach, if February has 28 days, then February 28 is 28 days after February 1. Wait, but that would be 28 days later. Wait, if February 1 is Friday, then February 28 is 27 days later. Because from February 1 to February 28 is 27 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have February 1 as day 1, then February 2 is day 2, ..., February 28 is day 28. So the number of days between February 1 and February 28 is 27 days. So adding 27 days to Friday. 27 divided by 7 is 3*7=21, remainder 6. So Friday + 6 days is Thursday. Therefore, February 28 is Thursday. Therefore, March 1 is Friday. So that's correct. Therefore, March 1 is Friday. So why did the other approach say that March 1 is Saturday? Because I think I made a mistake in that approach. So the"], [124, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Thursday, June 30 to Tuesday, September 6, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Give the count numerically.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Saturdays fall between June 30, 2022 (Thursday) and September 6, 2022 (Tuesday), inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out the dates of each Saturday in that range.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way than listing all the dates. Let me think. The start date is June 30, 2022, which is a Thursday. So the next day, July 1st is Friday. Then July 2nd is Saturday. So the first Saturday in the range is July 2nd. Then every 7 days after that. Let me check the end date. September 6th is a Tuesday. So the last Saturday would be... Let's see. Let me figure out the days of the week for each month.\n\nFirst, June 30 is Thursday. July has 31 days. So July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday. Then July 9, 16, 23, 30 are Saturdays. Then August has 31 days. August 6 is a Saturday? Wait, let me check. Wait, July has 31 days. So July 31 is a Monday (since July 2 is Saturday, adding 29 days later, which is 4 weeks and 1 day. So July 2 + 29 days is July 31, which is Saturday + 29 days. 29 divided by 7 is 4 weeks (28 days) and 1 day. So July 31 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, July 2 is Saturday. July 9 is Saturday (plus 7 days). July 16, 23, 30. Then July 31 is the next day, which is Sunday. So August 1 is Monday. Then August 6 is Saturday? Let me check. August 1 is Monday. So August 6 is Saturday (Monday + 5 days). Then August 13, 20, 27. Then September 3 is Saturday. Then September 10 is Saturday, but September 6 is Tuesday. So the last Saturday before September 6 would be September 3. Wait, September 6 is Tuesday. So September 3 is Saturday. So the Saturdays in the range would be July 2, 9, 16, 23, 30; August 6, 13, 20, 27; and September 3. Let me count those. That's 5 in July, 4 in August, 1 in September. Total of 5+4+1=10? Wait, but wait, let me check each date.\n\nWait, July 2 is Saturday. Then July 9 (add 7 days), 16, 23, 30. That's five Saturdays in July. Then August 6 is Saturday (since July 31 is Sunday, August 1 is Monday, so August 6 is Saturday). Then August 13, 20, 27. That's four more. Then September 3 is Saturday. So that's 5 + 4 + 1 = 10. But wait, the end date is September 6. So September 3 is before September 6, so that's included. So total of 10 Saturdays. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check each date again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between June 30 and September 6, then divide by 7 and adjust for the start and end days. But that might be more complicated. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, June 30 is the start date. Let's calculate the total number of days from June 30 to September 6 inclusive. June has 30 days, so June 30 is the last day of June. Then July has 31 days, August 31, and September 6. So from June 30 to July 31 is 31 days (since June 30 is day 1, July 1 is day 2, etc. Wait, no. Wait, if you include both start and end dates, the total days would be (September 6 - June 30) + 1. Let me compute that.\n\nJune 30 to July 31 is 31 days (since July has 31 days). Then August has 31 days, so from June 30 to August 31 is 31 (July) + 31 (August) = 62 days. Then September 6 is 6 days into September. So total days from June 30 to September 6 inclusive is 62 + 6 = 68 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, June 30 is day 1. Then July 1 is day 2, July 2 is day 3, etc. Wait, maybe I should calculate the total days between the two dates. Let me check using another method.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: (end date - start date) + 1. So June 30 to September 6 is (September 6 - June 30) + 1. Let me compute the difference in days. June has 30 days, so June 30 is the last day. July has 31 days, so July 31 is 31 days after June 30. Then August has 31 days, so August 31 is 31 + 31 = 62 days after June 30. Then September 6 is 6 days after August 31. So total days from June 30 to September 6 is 62 + 6 = 68 days. So 68 days in total. Now, if I divide 68 by 7, that's 9 weeks and 5 days. So there are 9 full weeks, which would be 9 Saturdays. Then the remaining 5 days would include the first 5 days of the period. Since the start date is Thursday, June 30, the next day is Friday (July 1), Saturday (July 2), Sunday (July 3), Monday (July 4), Tuesday (July 5). So the first 5 days include one Saturday (July 2). So total Saturdays would be 9 + 1 = 10. That matches the previous count. So the answer is 10. But wait, let me check again. Because if there are 68 days, and the first day is Thursday, then the number of Saturdays would be the number of times Saturday occurs in that period. Let me think of the first day as Thursday (day 1). Then day 1: Thu, day 2: Fri, day 3: Sat. So the first Saturday is day 3. Then every 7 days after that. So the number of Saturdays is the number of days in the period divided by 7, rounded up or down depending on the start and end. Alternatively, the formula is floor((end_date - start_date)/7) + 1 if the start date is a Saturday. But maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, since the first Saturday is day 3 (June 30 is day 1, July 2 is day 3). Then the last day is day 68. Let's see what day of the week day 68 is. Since day 1 is Thursday, day 1 + 67 days is day 68. 67 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 4 days. So day 68 is Thursday + 4 days = Monday. So the last day is Monday. So the last Saturday would be day 68 - (68 - 3) mod 7? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The first Saturday is day 3. Then the next is day 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66. Let's count those. 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59, 66. That's 10 Saturdays. Then day 66 is Saturday. The next Saturday would be day 73, which is beyond the 68 days. So yes, 10 Saturdays. So the answer is 10. Therefore, the count is 10.\n</think>", "10"], [124, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, July 17, 2022 to Tuesday, August 23, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

But wait, since the start and end dates are both included, I need to calculate the total days and then subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break the period into weeks and then add the remaining days. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's check the days of the week for each date. July 17 is a Sunday. Then July 18 is Monday, July 19 is Tuesday, July 20 is Wednesday, July 21 is Thursday, July 22 is Friday, July 23 is Saturday, July 24 is Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo from July 17 (Sunday) to August 23 (Tuesday). Let me figure out how many days are in total between these two dates.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of days from July 17 to August 23 inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. Wait, because inclusive. Let me check: July 17 is day 1, July 18 is day 2, ..., July 31 is day 15. Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total days would be 15 + 23 = 38 days. Wait, but that's from July 17 to August 23 inclusive. Let me confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the actual dates. Let me check the number of days between July 17 and August 23. Let's see:\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 = 14 days, but since we include both start and end, it's 14 + 1 = 15 days. Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total is 15 + 23 = 38 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 38 days.\n\nNow, out of these 38 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nBut since the start date is Sunday, July 17, which is a weekend day. Then the next day, July 18 is Monday (business day). Let's list the days:\n\nJuly 17: Sunday (non-business)\nJuly 18: Monday (business)\nJuly 19: Tuesday (business)\nJuly 20: Wednesday (business)\nJuly 21: Thursday (business)\nJuly 22: Friday (business)\nJuly 23: Saturday (non-business)\nJuly 24: Sunday (non-business)\nJuly 25: Monday (business)\nJuly 26: Tuesday (business)\nJuly 27: Wednesday (business)\nJuly 28: Thursday (business)\nJuly 29: Friday (business)\nJuly 30: Saturday (non-business)\nJuly 31: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 1: Monday (business)\nAugust 2: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 3: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 4: Thursday (business)\nAugust 5: Friday (business)\nAugust 6: Saturday (non-business)\nAugust 7: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 8: Monday (business)\nAugust 9: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 10: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 11: Thursday (business)\nAugust 12: Friday (business)\nAugust 13: Saturday (non-business)\nAugust 14: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 15: Monday (business)\nAugust 16: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 17: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 18: Thursday (business)\nAugust 19: Friday (business)\nAugust 20: Saturday (non-business)\nAugust 21: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 22: Monday (business)\nAugust 23: Tuesday (business)\n\nWait, but the end date is August 23, which is Tuesday. So I need to check if all these days are included. Let me count the number of weekends in this period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weekends by figuring out how many weeks are in the total days and then the remaining days.\n\nTotal days: 38 days.\n\nEach week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). So 38 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 3 days. So 5 weeks would be 5*2=10 weekend days. Then the remaining 3 days are July 17 (Sunday), July 18 (Monday), July 19 (Tuesday). Wait, but the first day is Sunday, so the remaining 3 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. But in this case, the first day is Sunday, so the first three days of the period are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So in those three days, the weekend days are Sunday (1 day). Then the remaining days would be 3 days, but the first day is Sunday, so the remaining days would be 3 days. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since the total days are 38, and the first day is Sunday, the last day is Tuesday. Let me think of the days as starting on Sunday, then the next days are Monday, Tuesday, etc. So the first week (July 17-23) includes 7 days. Then the next weeks would be July 24-30 (7 days), July 31 (Sunday) and August 1-7 (7 days), August 8-14 (7 days), August 15-21 (7 days), August 22-23 (2 days). Wait, maybe that's a better way to break it down.\n\nWait, let me count the weeks:\n\nFrom July 17 (Sunday) to July 23 (Saturday) is 7 days (one week). Then July 24 (Sunday) to July 30 (Saturday) is another week. Then July 31 (Sunday) to August 6 (Saturday) is another week. Then August 7 (Sunday) to August 13 (Saturday) is another week. Then August 14 (Sunday) to August 20 (Saturday) is another week. Then August 21 (Sunday) to August 23 (Tuesday) is 3 days.\n\nSo total weeks: 5 full weeks (each 7 days) and 3 days. Wait, but let me check:\n\nJuly 17 (Sunday) to July 23 (Saturday): 7 days.\n\nJuly 24 (Sunday) to July 30 (Saturday): 7 days.\n\nJuly 31 (Sunday) to August 6 (Saturday): 7 days.\n\nAugust 7 (Sunday) to August 13 (Saturday): 7 days.\n\nAugust 14 (Sunday) to August 20 (Saturday): 7 days.\n\nThen August 21 (Sunday) to August 23 (Tuesday): 3 days.\n\nSo total days: 5*7 + 3 = 35 + 3 = 38 days. Correct.\n\nNow, in each of the 5 full weeks, there are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). So 5*2=10 weekend days. Then in the remaining 3 days (August 21, 22, 23), which are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So in those 3 days, only Sunday is a weekend day. So total weekend days are 10 + 1 = 11.\n\nTherefore, total business days would be total days (38) minus weekend days (11) = 27 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because the first week (July 17-23) includes Sunday (17), Monday (18), Tuesday (19), Wednesday (20), Thursday (21), Friday (22), Saturday (23). So in that week, 2 weekend days: Sunday and Saturday. Then the next week (July 24-30): Sunday (24), Monday (25), Tuesday (26), Wednesday (27), Thursday (28), Friday (29), Saturday (30). Again 2 weekend days. Then July 31 (Sunday) to August 6 (Saturday): 2 weekend days. Then August 7-13: 2 weekend days. August 14-20: 2 weekend days. Then August 21-23: Sunday (21), Monday (22), Tuesday (23). So only Sunday is a weekend day. So total weekend days: 5*2 +1= 11. So total business days: 38-11=27.\n\nBut wait, let me check the actual count of business days. Let me list them:\n\nFrom July 17 (Sunday) to August 23 (Tuesday). Let's count the business days.\n\nFirst, July 17 is Sunday (non-business). Then July 18 (Mon) is business. July 19 (Tue) business. July 20 (Wed) business. July 21 (Thu) business. July 22 (Fri) business. July 23 (Sat) non-business. July 24 (Sun) non-business. July 25 (Mon) business. July 26 (Tue) business. July 27 (Wed) business. July 28 (Thu) business. July 29 (Fri) business. July 30 (Sat) non-business. July 31 (Sun) non-business. August 1 (Mon) business. August 2 (Tue) business. August 3 (Wed) business. August 4 (Thu) business. August 5 (Fri) business. August 6 (Sat) non-business. August 7 (Sun) non-business. August 8 (Mon) business. August 9 (Tue) business. August 10 (Wed) business. August 11 (Thu) business. August 12 (Fri) business. August 13 (Sat) non-business. August 14 (Sun) non-business. August 15 (Mon) business. August 16 (Tue) business. August 17 (Wed) business. August 18 (Thu) business. August 19 (Fri) business. August 20 (Sat) non-business. August 21 (Sun) non-business. August 22 (Mon) business. August 23 (Tue) business.\n\nNow, let's count the business days. Let's go through each day:\n\nJuly 18 (1), 19 (2), 20 (3), 21 (4), 22 (5), 25 (6), 26 (7), 27 (8), 28 (9), 29 (10), 31 (no, July 31 is non-business), August 1 (11), 2 (12), 3 (13), 4 (14), 5 (15), 8 (16), 9 (17), 10 (18), 11 (19), 12 (20), 15 (21), 16 (22), 17 (23), 18 (24), 19 (25), 22 (26), 23 (27). \n\nSo that's 27 business days. So the answer is 27. Therefore, the count is 27.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's calculate the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, etc., between the dates.\n\nBut since the start date is Sunday, and the end date is Tuesday, maybe it's easier to count the number of each weekday.\n\nBut perhaps the first method is correct. So the answer is 27.\n</think>", "27"], [124, "Between Wednesday, May 18, 2022 and Friday, June 3, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Tuesday occur? Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many times Tuesday occurs between Wednesday, May 18, 2022, and Friday, June 3, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. So I need to figure out the number of Tuesdays in that time frame.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates to make sure I have the correct start and end dates. The period starts on Wednesday, May 18, 2022, and ends on Friday, June 3, 2022. Both dates are included. So I need to count all the Tuesdays from May 18 to June 3, including both ends.\n\nWait, but how many days are there in total between those dates? Maybe I should first figure out the total number of days, then see how many weeks and extra days there are, and then determine how many Tuesdays are in there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list out the dates and count the Tuesdays. But that might take longer. Let me think. Let's start by checking what day of the week May 18, 2022, was. Wait, the problem says that the start date is Wednesday, May 18. So that's a Wednesday. So May 18 is a Wednesday. Then, the next day, May 19 is Thursday, May 20 is Friday, May 21 is Saturday, May 22 is Sunday, May 23 is Monday, May 24 is Tuesday. So May 24 is a Tuesday. Then May 25 is Wednesday, and so on.\n\nSo the first Tuesday in the period is May 24. Then each week after that would have another Tuesday. Let me check how many weeks are in the period. Let's calculate the total number of days from May 18 to June 3 inclusive.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of days in May after May 18. May has 31 days. So from May 18 to May 31 inclusive is 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. Wait, May 18 is day 1, May 19 is day 2, ..., May 31 is day 14. Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total days from May 18 to June 3 inclusive is 14 + 3 = 17 days. Wait, 14 days in May (from 18th to 31st) and 3 days in June (1st to 3rd). So total 17 days. Let me check that again. May 18 to May 19 is 2 days, so May 18 to May 31 is 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total 14 + 3 = 17 days. So the total period is 17 days.\n\nNow, since the first day is Wednesday, May 18, and the last day is Friday, June 3. So the total days are 17. Now, how many Tuesdays are there in 17 days?\n\nWell, since the first day is Wednesday, the first Tuesday is May 24 (as I thought earlier). Let's count the Tuesdays. Let's list the dates:\n\nMay 18: Wednesday\n\nMay 19: Thursday\n\nMay 20: Friday\n\nMay 21: Saturday\n\nMay 22: Sunday\n\nMay 23: Monday\n\nMay 24: Tuesday (1st Tuesday)\n\nMay 25: Wednesday\n\nMay 26: Thursday\n\nMay 27: Friday\n\nMay 28: Saturday\n\nMay 29: Sunday\n\nMay 30: Monday\n\nMay 31: Tuesday (2nd Tuesday)\n\nJune 1: Wednesday\n\nJune 2: Thursday\n\nJune 3: Friday (last day)\n\nSo in this list, the Tuesdays are May 24, May 31, and then June 7 would be the next Tuesday, but June 7 is outside the period. Wait, the period ends on June 3. So only two Tuesdays: May 24 and May 31. Wait, but that's only two. But wait, let me check again. Wait, May 24 is the first Tuesday, then May 31 is the next. Then June 7 would be the third, but that's beyond June 3. So only two Tuesdays?\n\nBut wait, the total days are 17. Let me check the days again. Let's count the days from May 18 to June 3. Let me check the dates again. May 18 is day 1 (Wednesday). Then May 19 is day 2 (Thursday), May 20 day 3 (Friday), May 21 day 4 (Saturday), May 22 day 5 (Sunday), May 23 day 6 (Monday), May 24 day 7 (Tuesday). Then May 25 is day 8 (Wednesday), May 26 day 9 (Thursday), May 27 day 10 (Friday), May 28 day 11 (Saturday), May 29 day 12 (Sunday), May 30 day 13 (Monday), May 31 day 14 (Tuesday). Then June 1 is day 15 (Wednesday), June 2 day 16 (Thursday), June 3 day 17 (Friday). So yes, the Tuesdays are on day 7 (May 24) and day 14 (May 31). So that's two Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer should be 2?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another way. Since the total number of days is 17, which is 2 weeks and 3 days. So 2 weeks would have 2 Tuesdays, and then the remaining 3 days would be Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So the first Tuesday is on day 7, then day 14, and then the next would be day 21, which is beyond the period. So yes, only two Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer is 2. But wait, the problem says \"counting both dates\". So the start date is Wednesday, May 18, which is included. The end date is Friday, June 3, included. So the total days are 17. So the answer is 2. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check May 24, 2022. Let me check what day that was. Wait, the problem says that May 18 is a Wednesday. So May 18 is Wednesday. Then May 19 is Thursday, May 20 Friday, May 21 Saturday, May 22 Sunday, May 23 Monday, May 24 Tuesday. Correct. Then May 25 is Wednesday. Then May 26 Thursday, May 27 Friday, May 28 Saturday, May 29 Sunday, May 30 Monday, May 31 Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. So yes, May 31 is Tuesday. Then June 3 is Friday. So between May 18 and June 3 inclusive, there are two Tuesdays: May 24 and May 31. Therefore, the answer is 2. But wait, maybe I should check if there's another Tuesday. Let me check June 7, but that's outside the period. So no. So the answer is 2. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again. May 18 to May 31 is 14 days. Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So 14 + 3 = 17 days. So that's correct. So 17 days. So 17 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 3 days. So two Tuesdays. So answer is 2. But wait, maybe I should check with another approach. Let me check the actual calendar. Wait, I can't check the actual calendar, but maybe I can use another method. Let me check the day of the week for May 31. Since May 18 is Wednesday, adding 13 days (May 18 + 13 days is May 31). 13 divided by 7 is 1 week and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Wednesday: Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. So May 31 is Tuesday. So that's correct. Then June 3 is Friday. So yes, two Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer is 2. So Answer: 2.\n</think>", "2"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 24 to Friday, June 24, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Express your answer as a number.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between April 24, 2022, and June 24, 2022, inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. The start date is Sunday, April 24, and the end date is Friday, June 24. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between these two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down into months. April has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30, that's 7 days. Then May has 31 days, and then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. Wait, but I need to check if the start date is April 24 (Sunday) and end date is June 24 (Friday). Let me confirm the dates first.\n\nWait, April 24, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me check that. Let me think. April 24, 2022. Let me recall that April 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So April 1 is Saturday, then April 2 is Sunday. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, maybe I should check a calendar. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, April 1, 2022 was a Friday? Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should use an online calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that, maybe I need to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 24 is a Sunday. Let me check. Let's take a known date. For example, April 1, 2022. Let me think. If April 1 is a Friday, then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. Wait, but that would make April 24 (24 days later) be a Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is Friday, April 15 is Friday, April 22 is Friday, and April 29 is Friday. Then April 24 would be 3 days after April 21 (which is a Monday?), wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 24, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me check that. Let me think of some other dates. For example, April 24, 2022. Let me check the day of the week. Let's take a known date. For example, April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then April 1 is Friday. Then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. Then April 4 is Monday. So April 1 + 23 days is April 24. Let's calculate 23 days later. 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So adding 3 weeks (21 days) to April 1 (Friday) would be April 22, which is Friday. Then adding 2 days would be April 23 (Saturday) and April 24 (Sunday). So yes, April 24, 2022 is a Sunday. So that's correct.\n\nSo the start date is Sunday, April 24. The end date is June 24, which is a Friday. Let me check that. Let's see. Let's count the days from April 24 to June 24. Let's break it down into months. April has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (including April 24). Then May has 31 days, so May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days from April 24 to June 24 inclusive is 7 (April) + 31 (May) + 24 (June) = 62 days? Wait, but wait, if April 24 is day 1, then April 25 is day 2, etc. Wait, but if I add 7 days (April 24 to April 30 inclusive), that's 7 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. But wait, that would be from April 24 to June 24 inclusive. Let me check that again. April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (since 30-24+1=7). Then May has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. So total days between the two dates is 62 days. Now, I need to find how many of those are weekdays (Monday-Friday).\n\nBut since the start date is Sunday, April 24, which is a weekend day. So the first day is Sunday. Then the next day is Monday, April 25. So the first weekday is April 25. Then the last day is June 24, which is a Friday. So the end date is a weekday.\n\nSo the total number of days is 62. Now, how many weekends are there in these 62 days? Let's calculate the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and subtract that from 62 to get the number of weekdays.\n\nAlternatively, since the start date is Sunday, and the end date is Friday, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks and the extra days.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the number of weekends. Let's see. Let's think of the first week: April 24 (Sunday) to April 26 (Tuesday). Wait, April 24 is Sunday, April 25 is Monday, April 26 is Tuesday, April 27 is Wednesday, April 28 is Thursday, April 29 is Friday, April 30 is Saturday. So in April, from April 24 to April 30, there are 7 days. The weekends here are April 24 (Sunday) and April 30 (Saturday). So that's 2 weekend days. Then May has 31 days. Let's check how many weekends are in May. May 1 is a Monday (since April 30 is Saturday, May 1 is Sunday? Wait, wait, April 30 is Saturday. So May 1 is Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with earlier. Wait, if April 24 is Sunday, then April 30 is Saturday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday. So May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, etc. So in May, the weekends are Sundays and Saturdays. So in May, how many weekends? Let's see. May has 31 days. Let's calculate the number of Saturdays and Sundays. Since May 1 is Sunday, then the first weekend is May 1 (Sunday) and May 2 (Monday) is not a weekend. Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday. So the first weekend is May 1 (Sunday) and May 7 (Saturday). Then the next weekend is May 8 (Sunday) and May 14 (Saturday), then May 15 (Sunday) and May 21 (Saturday), then May 22 (Sunday) and May 28 (Saturday), then May 29 (Sunday) and May 31 (Saturday). Wait, May 31 is a Saturday? Let me check. May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, ..., May 7 is Saturday. Then May 8 is Sunday. So each week has 2 weekend days. So in May, how many weeks? 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks would be 28 days, and 3 days left. The first 28 days would have 4 weekends (each week has 2 weekend days). Then the remaining 3 days are May 29 (Sunday), May 30 (Monday), May 31 (Tuesday). Wait, no. Wait, May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So the remaining 3 days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So in that case, the number of weekend days in May is 4 weeks * 2 = 8 weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) plus 1 Sunday (May 29). So total 9 weekend days in May. Wait, but May 29 is Sunday, and May 31 is Tuesday. So the remaining 3 days include one Sunday. So total weekends in May would be 8 + 1 = 9? Wait, but May 29 is Sunday, and May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So the only weekend day in the remaining 3 days is May 29 (Sunday). So that's 1. So total weekends in May is 4*2 +1 = 9. So that's 9 weekend days in May.\n\nThen June. June 1 is a Wednesday (since May 31 is Tuesday, so June 1 is Wednesday). Wait, May 31 is Tuesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday, June 5 is Sunday. So in June, the weekends are Saturday and Sunday. The period we are considering is June 1 to June 24. So let's check how many weekends are in that period. June 1 is Wednesday. So the first weekend in June is June 4 (Saturday) and June 5 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is June 11 (Saturday) and June 12 (Sunday), then June 18 (Saturday) and June 19 (Sunday), then June 25 (Saturday) and June 26 (Sunday). But our end date is June 24, so the last weekend in the period is June 18 (Saturday) and June 19 (Sunday). So how many weekends are in June 1 to June 24?\n\nLet's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in that period. Let's list them:\n\nFirst weekend: June 4 (Sat), June 5 (Sun)\n\nSecond: June 11 (Sat), June 12 (Sun)\n\nThird: June 18 (Sat), June 19 (Sun)\n\nFourth: June 25 (Sat), but that's beyond June 24. So only three weekends in June. Each weekend has 2 days, so 3*2=6 days. But wait, June 24 is a Friday. So the last day of the period is June 24. So the last weekend day in the period is June 19 (Sunday). So that's three weekends. So 3*2=6 weekend days in June.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period:\n\nApril: 2 (April 24 and 30)\n\nMay: 9\n\nJune: 6\n\nTotal weekends: 2 + 9 + 6 = 17.\n\nSo total days is 62. So weekdays would be 62 - 17 = 45. Wait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nWait, let me check again. April 24 to April 30 is 7 days. The weekends are April 24 (Sunday) and April 30 (Saturday). That's 2 days. Correct.\n\nMay has 31 days. The weekends are 9 days. Let me check again. May 1 is Sunday. So the first weekend is May 1 (Sunday) and May 7 (Saturday). Then May 8 (Sunday) and May 14 (Saturday). Then May 15 (Sunday) and May 21 (Saturday). Then May 22 (Sunday) and May 28 (Saturday). Then May 29 (Sunday) and May 31 (Saturday). Wait, May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. Wait, so May 31 is Tuesday. So the last weekend in May is May 28 (Saturday) and May 29 (Sunday). So that's 4 weekends (each with 2 days) in the first 28 days (4 weeks), and then May 29 is Sunday. So that's 4*2 +1 = 9. So that's correct. So 9 weekend days in May.\n\nJune: June 1 is Wednesday. So the first weekend is June 4 (Saturday) and June 5 (Sunday). Then June 11 (Saturday) and June 12 (Sunday). Then June 18 (Saturday) and June 19 (Sunday). Then June 25 (Saturday) and June 26 (Sunday). But since our period ends on June 24, which is Friday, the last weekend is June 19 (Sunday). So that's three weekends, each with two days. So 3*2=6. So total 6. So total weekends is 2+9+6=17. So 62-17=45 weekdays. So the answer is 45?\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's count the number of weekdays directly. Starting from April 24 (Sunday) which is a weekend. So the first weekday is April 25 (Monday). Then April 25 to April 30: April 25 (Mon), 26 (Tue), 27 (Wed), 28 (Thu), 29 (Fri), 30 (Sat). Wait, April 30 is Saturday. So from April 25 to April 30, there are 6 days. The weekdays are Mon-Fri (April 25-29) which is 5 days, and April 30 is Saturday (weekend). So that's 5 weekdays in April.\n\nThen May. May has 31 days. Since May 1 is Sunday, the weekdays in May would be from May 1 (Sunday) to May 31 (Tuesday). Wait, but how many weekdays? Let's think. Each week has 5 weekdays. May has 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks have 4*5=20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days are May 29 (Sunday), May 30 (Monday), May 31 (Tuesday). So the remaining days include 2 weekdays (Monday and Tuesday) and 1 weekend (Sunday). So total weekdays in May would be 20 + 2 = 22. Wait, but that's 22. Wait, but earlier I calculated that there are 9 weekend days in May, so total days 31, so 31-9=22 weekdays. That's correct. So May has 22 weekdays.\n\nThen June. June 1 is Wednesday. The period is June 1 to June 24. Let's count the weekdays. June has 24 days. Let's see. June 1 is Wednesday. So the first week: June 1 (Wed), 2 (Thu), 3 (Fri), 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun). Then June 6 (Mon), 7 (Tue), 8 (Wed), etc. So the number of weekdays in June 1-24. Let's calculate. Let's see, June 1 is Wednesday. So the first week (June 1-7) has 3 weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri) and 2 weekends (Sat, Sun). Then the next weeks. Let's count the number of weeks. 24 days. 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So 3 weeks (21 days) plus 3 days. The 3 weeks would have 3*5=15 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days are June 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat). Wait, no. Wait, June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 is day 1, June 2 is day 2, ..., June 7 is day 7. Then June 8 is day 8 (Monday), and so on. Wait, 24 days. Let me list the days:\n\nJune 1: Wed\n\nJune 2: Thu\n\nJune 3: Fri\n\nJune 4: Sat\n\nJune 5: Sun\n\nJune 6: Mon\n\nJune 7: Tue\n\nJune 8: Wed\n\nJune 9: Thu\n\nJune 10: Fri\n\nJune 11: Sat\n\nJune 12: Sun\n\nJune 13: Mon\n\nJune 14: Tue\n\nJune 15: Wed\n\nJune 16: Thu\n\nJune 17: Fri\n\nJune 18: Sat\n\nJune 19: Sun\n\nJune 20: Mon\n\nJune 21: Tue\n\nJune 22: Wed\n\nJune 23: Thu\n\nJune 24: Fri\n\nSo from June 1 to June 24, the days are as above. Now, the weekdays are all days except Saturday and Sunday. So let's count the weekdays. Let's go through each day:\n\nJune 1 (Wed) - weekday\n\nJune 2 (Thu) - weekday\n\nJune 3 (Fri) - weekday\n\nJune 4 (Sat) - weekend\n\nJune 5 (Sun) - weekend\n\nJune 6 (Mon) - weekday\n\nJune 7 (Tue) - weekday\n\nJune 8 (Wed) - weekday\n\nJune 9 (Thu) - weekday\n\nJune 10 (Fri) - weekday\n\nJune 11 (Sat) - weekend"], [124, "If today is Wednesday, March 30, 2022, what day of the week was it 2 days ago?

And I need to answer with the complete weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of just \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what day it was two days before Wednesday. Let me think. If today is Wednesday, then yesterday would be Tuesday. So one day ago was Tuesday. Then two days ago would be Monday. Wait, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count backward. Let's start from today, March 30, 2022, which is a Wednesday. Subtract one day: March 29, 2022, would be Tuesday. Subtract another day: March 28, 2022, would be Monday. So yes, two days ago would be Monday. \n\nBut wait, sometimes when people talk about days, they might get confused with the order. Let me confirm. If today is Wednesday, then the day before is Tuesday (1 day ago), and the day before that is Monday (2 days ago). So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar to check. But since I don't have a calendar in front of me, I need to rely on my knowledge. I remember that March 30, 2022, was indeed a Wednesday. Let me think about other dates. For example, March 28 was a Monday. Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the days? But 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. But March is unaffected. So the days in March would follow normally. \n\nAnother way to check is to think about the week cycle. Each week has 7 days. So if today is Wednesday, then 7 days ago would also be Wednesday. So 7 days before March 30 is March 23, which would also be a Wednesday. But that's not directly helpful here. But if I go back two days from March 30, it's March 28, which is Monday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 31 is a Thursday. Wait, if March 30 is Wednesday, then March 31 is Thursday. So March 29 is Tuesday, March 28 is Monday. That's correct. So two days ago would be Monday. \n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be Monday.\n</think>", "Monday"], [124, "If today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022, what day of the week was it 56 days ago? Answer using the complete weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking: If today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022, what day of the week was it 56 days ago? And I need to answer with the complete weekday name, like \"Tuesday\" instead of \"Tue\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to calculate the day of the week 56 days before Tuesday, February 8, 2022. Since days of the week cycle every 7 days, maybe I can divide 56 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me check: 56 divided by 7 is exactly 8. So that means 56 days ago is exactly 8 weeks before today. Since a week has 7 days, subtracting 8 weeks would bring me back to the same day of the week. Wait, but that would mean that 56 days ago was also a Tuesday? But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I need to verify if there are any leap years or something affecting the date?\n\nWait, but the problem says today is February 8, 2022. Let me check if 2022 is a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also by 400. 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, so not a leap year. So February has 28 days in 2022. So February 8 minus 56 days. Let me think about how to subtract 56 days from February 8.\n\nAlternatively, since 56 days is exactly 8 weeks, subtracting 8 weeks from February 8 would take me back to February 8 minus 56 days. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 8 weeks is 56 days. So if I subtract 8 weeks from February 8, 2022, that would be February 8 minus 56 days. But how does that date translate?\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. Let's subtract 56 days step by step. But that might take too long. Alternatively, since 56 days is 8 weeks, then the day of the week should be the same. So if today is Tuesday, then 56 days ago would also be Tuesday. But maybe I need to check if that's correct. Because sometimes when you subtract days, especially across months, the day of the week might not be the same if there's a month with 31 days or something. Wait, but 56 days is exactly 8 weeks, so regardless of the months, subtracting 8 weeks would land on the same day of the week. So even if the date is in a different month, the day of the week would be the same. So if today is Tuesday, then 56 days ago would also be Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with a specific example. Let's take a smaller number. Suppose today is Tuesday, March 1, 2022. Then 7 days ago would be Monday, March 25, 2022. Wait, no, March 1 minus 7 days is February 25, 2022. Wait, but if March 1 is a Tuesday, then February 25 would be a Monday. Wait, but that's 7 days before. So that's correct. So if I subtract 7 days, the day of the week is the same. So 56 days is 8 times 7, so same day. Therefore, 56 days ago would be Tuesday. So the answer is Tuesday. But maybe I should check with actual dates. Let me check the actual calendar for 2022.\n\nWait, but I don't have a calendar here. But maybe I can calculate the date. Let's try. Let's subtract 56 days from February 8, 2022. Let's break it down. Let's subtract 28 days first. February 8 minus 28 days would be November 8, 2021? Wait, no. Wait, February has 28 days in 2022. So February 8 minus 28 days would be November 8, 2021? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should subtract months. Wait, 56 days is 8 weeks. So if I subtract 8 weeks from February 8, 2022, that would be February 8 minus 56 days. Let's subtract 56 days step by step. Let's subtract 28 days first. February 8 minus 28 days is November 8, 2021? Wait, no. Wait, February 8 minus 28 days would be November 8, 2021? Wait, that's not right. Wait, February 8 minus 28 days would be November 8, 2021? Wait, no. Wait, if I subtract 28 days from February 8, 2022, that would be November 8, 2021? Wait, that's not correct. Because February 8 minus 28 days would be November 8, 2021? Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of months. Let's see, February 8 minus 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from February 8. February has 28 days, so February 8 minus 28 days would be January 8, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, if I subtract 28 days from February 8, that would be February 8 minus 28 days. Let's count: February 8 minus 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from February 8. Let's subtract 28 days. Let's think of it as going back 28 days.

Wait, if I go back 28 days from February 8, that would be January 8, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, February 8 minus 28 days. Let's think of it as going back 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from February 8.

Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1999 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1999 divided by 4. 4 times 499 is 1996, so 1999 minus 1996 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 1999 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check the rules to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nThe rules are: 1) divisible by 4, 2) if divisible by 100, must also be divisible by 400. So, if a year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year. But if it's divisible by 100 but not by 400, it's not. But 1999 isn't even divisible by 100. Let me confirm that. 1999 divided by 100 is 19.99, so no, it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition doesn't apply here. Since 1999 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me check again. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2000 minus 4 is 1996. So 1996 is divisible by 4. Then 1996 + 4 is 2000. So 1999 is one year after 1996, so 1999 would be 1996 + 3, which is 3 years away from the next multiple of 4. Therefore, 1999 is not divisible by 4. So that confirms it again. Therefore, 1999 is not a leap year. \n\nI think that's all. The answer should be No.\n</think>", "No"], [124, "How many Tuesdays are there from Sunday, September 18, 2022 to Tuesday, November 15, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Write the total number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many Tuesdays there are between September 18, 2022, and November 15, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem. The dates given are from Sunday, September 18, 2022, to Tuesday, November 15, 2022, and I need to count all the Tuesdays in that range, including both start and end dates.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week each of these dates falls on. Wait, the problem already says that September 18 is a Sunday and November 15 is a Tuesday. So that's helpful. But maybe I need to confirm that? Or maybe I can just use that information given.\n\nBut maybe I should verify the days to make sure. Let me think. Let's check September 18, 2022. If I remember correctly, September 18, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that September 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me count the days from September 1 to September 18. September has 30 days, so from September 1 to September 18 is 17 days later. 17 days divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 3 days. So if September 1 is a Thursday, adding 3 days would be Sunday. So September 18 is indeed a Sunday. That checks out. And November 15 is a Tuesday. Let me check that. Let's see, maybe I can count the days from September 18 to November 15. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, September has 30 days. So from September 18 to September 30 is 12 days (since 30 - 18 = 12, but including September 18, it's 13 days? Wait, no. Wait, if I start on September 18, then September 18 is day 1. Then September 19 is day 2, etc. So from September 18 to September 30 inclusive is 30 - 18 + 1 = 13 days. Then October has 31 days, and November 15 is 15 days into November. So total days from September 18 to November 15 inclusive is 13 (September) + 31 (October) + 15 (November) = 13 + 31 is 44, plus 15 is 59 days. Wait, but that's the total number of days between those two dates. But maybe I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can check the number of days between the two dates. But perhaps that's not necessary. Since the problem says that the end date is Tuesday, November 15, 2022. So that's a Tuesday. So the start date is Sunday, and the end date is Tuesday. So the total number of days between them is 59 days. But how does that help me count the Tuesdays?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list out the Tuesdays in each month. Let's see. The period starts on September 18, 2022, which is a Sunday. So the first Tuesday after that would be September 20, 2022. Then each subsequent Tuesday. Then in September, how many Tuesdays are there? Let's see. September 18 is Sunday. So September 19 is Monday, 20 is Tuesday. Then 27 is the next Tuesday. Then October 4, 11, 18, 25. Then November 1, 8, 15. Wait, but November 15 is the end date. So let me check each month.\n\nFirst, September 2022. The first Tuesday is September 20. Then the next one is September 27. So that's two Tuesdays in September. Then October 2022. October has 31 days. The first Tuesday of October is October 4. Then 11, 18, 25. That's four Tuesdays. Then November 2022. The first Tuesday is November 1, then 8, 15. But since the end date is November 15, which is a Tuesday, that's included. So three Tuesdays in November. So total Tuesdays would be 2 (September) + 4 (October) + 3 (November) = 9. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Wait, but the start date is September 18, which is a Sunday. So the first Tuesday is September 20. Then September 27. Then October 4, 11, 18, 25. Then November 1, 8, 15. So that's 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 Tuesdays. But wait, is that all?\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the first Tuesday is indeed in the range. Since the start date is September 18, which is Sunday. So the first Tuesday is September 20, which is within the range. Then the last Tuesday is November 15, which is included. So that's correct. So 9 Tuesdays. But let me check again. Let me count each month's Tuesdays.\n\nSeptember 2022: 20, 27. That's two.\n\nOctober 2022: 4, 11, 18, 25. Four.\n\nNovember 2022: 1, 8, 15. Three. Total 2+4+3=9. So the answer is 9?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any mistake here. Let me check the dates again. Let's take September 20, 2022. That's a Tuesday. Then September 27 is also a Tuesday. Then October 4, 11, 18, 25. Then November 1, 8, 15. So that's 2+4+3=9. But wait, the start date is September 18, which is Sunday. So the first Tuesday is September 20. So that's correct. The end date is November 15, which is Tuesday. So that's included. So yes, 9 Tuesdays. But maybe I should check the total number of days between the dates to see if that's consistent. Let me check the total days. From September 18 to November 15 inclusive. Let's calculate that. September has 30 days. So from September 18 to September 30 is 13 days (including both ends). Then October has 31 days. Then November 1 to November 15 is 15 days. So total days is 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. Now, if there are 59 days, how many Tuesdays are there? Well, the first day is Sunday, so the days of the week would cycle every 7 days. Let's see. Let's calculate the number of weeks and extra days. 59 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 3 days. So 8 weeks is 56 days, and 3 days left. So the first day is Sunday, so the first 56 days would have exactly 8 Tuesdays (since each week has one Tuesday). Then the remaining 3 days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So that would add one more Tuesday. So total Tuesdays would be 8 + 1 = 9. Which matches the previous count. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 9. So the answer should be 9.\n</think>", "9"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the last Saturday in November 2022. Give the count numerically.

Wait, I think I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use some other method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the days of the week for November 2022. Let me try to list out the dates and their corresponding days. But since I don't have a calendar in front of me, I need to calculate it. Let me think. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then November 2 is Wednesday, 3 is Thursday, 4 is Friday, 5 is Saturday. So the first Saturday is the 5th. Then each week after that would be adding 7 days. So the next Saturday would be the 12th, 19th, and 26th. Then the next one would be December 3rd, but that's outside of November. So the last Saturday in November would be the 26th. Wait, but wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check again. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then adding 4 days gets to the 5th, which is Saturday. Then adding 7 days would be 12th, 19th, 26th. Then 26th plus 7 is December 3rd. So November has 30 days. So 26th is the last Saturday. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me confirm the day of the week for November 1, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another approach. Let me think about known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, I think that's not right. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Let me check. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no, because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021, was a Friday, then 2022 would start on a Saturday. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to find a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that November 2022 has 30 days. Let me check the days of the week for November 2022. Let me think of some known dates. For example, I know that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then November 5 would be Saturday. So that would make the first Saturday the 5th. Then adding 7 days, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then the next one would be December 3rd. So the last Saturday in November is the 26th. Therefore, the answer should be 26. But wait, maybe I need to confirm that November 26 is indeed a Saturday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for November 26. Let's see. If November 5 is a Saturday, then November 12 is also a Saturday. Then November 19 is Saturday, and November 26 is Saturday. So that's correct. So the last Saturday in November 2022 is the 26th. Therefore, the answer is 26. But wait, maybe I should check if there's a mistake here. Let me think again. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then November 5 is Saturday. Then adding 7 days, 12th is Saturday. Then 19th, 26th. So yes, 26th is the last one. So the answer is 26.

The problem is to find out what day of the week March 3rd is, given that January 1st is a Monday. Hmm, I need to figure out the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are in January, February, and then up to March 3rd. Since January 1st is a Monday, January has 31 days. So January 1st is Monday, then January 8th is also a Monday, and so on. But maybe I need to count the total days from January 1st to March 3rd.\n\nLet me break it down. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, the problem doesn't mention a leap year. But since the question is about a specific year where January 1st is a Monday, I need to check if that year is a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, maybe I need to assume it's not a leap year unless specified? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that doesn't require knowing if it's a leap year. Wait, but March 3rd is in the same year, so if the year is a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't mention a leap year, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year. But wait, maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Or maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says \"in a year where Monday is January 1st\". So the year could be a leap year or not. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to assume that it's not a leap year. But maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. If it's a leap year, then February has 29 days, which would affect the total days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check both possibilities? Wait, but that's not possible. The problem must have a unique answer, so maybe the year is not a leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption. So, if it's not a leap year, then February has 28 days. So from January 1st to March 3rd is 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 3 (March) = 62 days? Wait, no. Wait, January 1st is day 1. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days into March, so total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 59 + 3 = 62 days. Wait, but if you count from January 1st (day 1) to March 3rd, that's 62 days. But wait, if you count the days between January 1st and March 3rd inclusive, then the number of days is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 3 (Mar) = 62 days. But if you want to find the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd, not including January 1st, then it's 61 days. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, you need to know how many days have passed since the starting day. So if January 1st is day 0 (Monday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Tuesday), etc. So the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd is 62 - 1 = 61 days? Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the number of days after January 1st. So March 3rd is 61 days after January 1st. Because January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days, that's 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days after February 28th, so 58 + 3 = 61 days. So March 3rd is 61 days after January 1st.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Monday, then each week has 7 days. So 61 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder gives the number of days ahead. Let's calculate 61 divided by 7. 7*8=56, 61-56=5. So the remainder is 5. So 5 days after Monday. Let's count: Monday (0), Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Saturday (5). Wait, so 5 days after Monday is Saturday. Wait, but wait, if the remainder is 5, then adding 5 days to Monday would be Saturday. So March 3rd would be a Saturday? But wait, let me check again. Wait, if January 1st is Monday, then January 1st is day 0. Then day 1 is Tuesday, day 2 Wednesday, day 3 Thursday, day 4 Friday, day 5 Saturday, day 6 Sunday, day 7 Monday again. So if March 3rd is 61 days after January 1st, then 61 divided by 7 is 8 weeks (56 days) and 5 days. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. So the answer would be Saturday. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 31 + 28 + 3 = 62 days. But if January 1st is day 1, then March 3rd is day 62. So the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd is 61 days. Because if you count from day 1 to day 62, that's 61 days later. So 61 days later. So 61 divided by 7 is 8*7=56, remainder 5. So 5 days after Monday. So Monday + 5 days is Saturday. So March 3rd is a Saturday. But wait, maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is Monday. Let's count the days in January. January has 31 days. So January 1st is Monday. Then January 8th is Monday again. January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then January 29th is Monday. Then January 30th is Tuesday, January 31st is Wednesday. So February 1st is Thursday. Then February has 28 days. So February 1st is Thursday. Then February 7th is Thursday, 14th, 21st, 28th. So February 28th is Thursday. Then March 1st is Friday. March 2nd is Saturday, March 3rd is Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. Wait, according to this step-by-step, March 3rd is Sunday. But earlier calculation said Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's check again. If January 1 is Monday, then January 1 is Monday. Then January 8 is Monday. January 15, 22, 29. So January 29 is Monday. Then January 30 is Tuesday, 31 is Wednesday. So February 1 is Thursday. Then February 1 is Thursday. Then February 8 is Thursday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Wait, February 29th would be Thursday. But if it's not a leap year, February has 28 days. So February 28th is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, if February 1 is Thursday, then February 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday, 5 is Monday, 6 is Tuesday, 7 is Wednesday, 8 is Thursday. So each week, so February 1 is Thursday. Then February 28 is 28 days later. 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks. So February 28 is also Thursday. Then March 1 is Friday. March 2 is Saturday, March 3 is Sunday. So according to this, March 3 is Sunday. But earlier calculation said Saturday. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh, the mistake is in the number of days between January 1 and March 3. Let me recalculate. If January 1 is day 1 (Monday), then March 3 is day 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 3 (Mar) = 62. So day 62. But the number of days between day 1 and day 62 is 61 days. So 61 days later. But when I calculated 61 divided by 7, I got 8 weeks (56 days) and 5 days. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. But according to the step-by-step, March 3 is Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the step-by-step. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to March 3. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1: Monday (1)\nJanuary 2: Tuesday (2)\n...\nJanuary 7: Sunday (7)\nJanuary 8: Monday (8)\n...\nJanuary 15: Monday (15)\n...\nJanuary 22: Monday (22)\n...\nJanuary 29: Monday (29)\nJanuary 30: Tuesday (30)\nJanuary 31: Wednesday (31)\nFebruary 1: Thursday (32)\nFebruary 2: Friday (33)\nFebruary 3: Saturday (34)\nFebruary 4: Sunday (35)\nFebruary 5: Monday (36)\nFebruary 6: Tuesday (37)\nFebruary 7: Wednesday (38)\nFebruary 8: Thursday (39)\n...\nFebruary 28: Thursday (32 + 27 = 59? Wait, wait. Wait, January has 31 days. So February 1 is day 32. Then February 28 is 32 + 27 = 59 days. Wait, 32 + 28 days would be day 60. Wait, no. Wait, day 32 is February 1. Then February 28 is 28 days later. So day 32 + 28 - 1 = day 59? Because day 32 is the first day of February. So day 32 is February 1. Then day 32 + 28 = day 60 is February 28? Wait, no. Wait, if you add 28 days to February 1, you get February 28. So day 32 + 28 = day 60. So February 28 is day 60. Then March 1 is day 61 (Friday), March 2 is day 62 (Saturday), March 3 is day 63 (Sunday). Wait, that's conflicting with the previous step-by-step. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1 is day 1 (Monday), then January 31 is day 31 (Wednesday). Then February 1 is day 32 (Thursday). Then February 28 is day 32 + 27 = day 59? Wait, no. Wait, from day 32 (February 1) to day 32 + 28 = day 60 is February 28. Because each day is +1. So day 32 is February 1, day 33 is February 2, ..., day 32 + 28 = day 60 is February 28. Then March 1 is day 61 (Friday), March 2 is day 62 (Saturday), March 3 is day 63 (Sunday). So according to this, March 3 is Sunday. But earlier calculation said 61 days after January 1 is day 62, which would be Saturday. Wait, but here, March 3 is day 63. So there's a discrepancy here. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh, the problem is in the initial calculation of the number of days. If January 1 is day 1, then the number of days from January 1 to March 3 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 3 (Mar) = 62 days. But if day 1 is January 1, then March 3 is day 62. But according to the step-by-step, March 3 is day 63. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's count the days. January has 31 days. So January 1 is day 1, January 2 is day 2, ..., January 31 is day 31. Then February 1 is day 32. February has 28 days, so February 28 is day 32 + 27 = day 59? No, wait, day 32 is February 1. Then February 2 is day 33, ..., February 28 is day 32 + 27 = day 59? Wait, no. Wait, 28 days in February. So day 32 (Feb 1) + 27 days = day 59 (Feb 28). Then March 1 is day 60 (Friday), March 2 is day 61 (Saturday), March 3 is day 62 (Sunday). Wait, that's different from before. So where did I get day 63 before? I think I made a mistake in the previous step-by-step. So according to this, March 3 is day 62, which is Sunday. But according to the first calculation, 61 days after January 1 is day 62. So 61 days later. So 61 divided by 7 is 8*7=56, remainder 5. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. But according to this, it's Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the calculation of the remainder. Let me check again. If January 1 is day 1 (Monday), then day 1 is Monday. Then day 1 + 61 days is day 62. So the day of the week is (Monday + 61 days). Since 61 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 5 days. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. But according to the step-by-step, day 62 is Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the step-by-step. Let me check the days again. Let's count the days from January 1 to March 3.\n\nJanuary 1: Monday (1)\nJanuary 8: Monday (8)\nJanuary 15: Monday (15)\nJanuary 22: Monday (22)\nJanuary 29: Monday (29)\nJanuary 30: Tuesday (30)\nJanuary 31: Wednesday (31)\nFebruary 1: Thursday (32)\nFebruary 2: Friday (33)\nFebruary 3: Saturday (34)\nFebruary 4: Sunday (35)\nFebruary 5: Monday (36)\nFebruary 6: Tuesday (37)\nFebruary 7: Wednesday (38)\nFebruary 8: Thursday (39)\nFebruary 9: Friday (40)\nFebruary 10: Saturday (41)\nFebruary 11: Sunday (42)\nFebruary 12: Monday (43)\nFebruary 13: Tuesday (44)\nFebruary 14: Wednesday (45)\nFebruary 15: Thursday (46)\nFebruary 16: Friday (47)\nFebruary 17: Saturday (48)\nFebruary 18: Sunday (49)\nFebruary 19: Monday (50)\nFebruary 20: Tuesday (51)\nFebruary 21: Wednesday (52)\nFebruary 22: Thursday (53)\nFebruary 23: Friday (54)\nFebruary 24: Saturday (55)\nFebruary 25: Sunday (56)\nFebruary 26: Monday (57)\nFebruary 27: Tuesday (58)\nFebruary 28: Wednesday (59)\nMarch 1: Thursday (60)\nMarch 2: Friday (61)\nMarch 3: Saturday (62)\n\nWait, now this is different. According to this, March 3 is Saturday. But earlier when I thought day 62 was Sunday, that was a mistake. So according to this step-by-step, March 3 is Saturday. But why did I get conflicting results before? Because I must have made a mistake in the previous step-by-step. So now, according to this, March 3 is Saturday. But according to the first calculation, 61 days after Monday is Saturday. So that matches. So where was the mistake in the previous step-by-step?\n\nAh, I think I had a miscalculation earlier. So the correct answer is Saturday. But why did I think earlier that March 3 was Sunday? Because I must have made a mistake in counting the days. So according to this detailed count, March 3 is Saturday. So the correct answer is Saturday.

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, right? So weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the dates involved. Let me check the dates. The start date is October 11, 2022, which is a Tuesday. The end date is October 20, 2022, which is a Thursday. So the period is from the 11th to the 20th, inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to count how many days are in this period and then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to list each day and check if it's a weekday. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with October 11, 2022: Tuesday. That's a weekday. Then October 12 is Wednesday, also a weekday. October 13 is Thursday. Then Friday, October 14. Then Saturday, October 15 (weekend), Sunday, October 16 (weekend). Then October 17 is Monday, weekday.

Let's see:\n\nFrom 11 to 14: 4 days (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri) \u2013 all weekdays. Then 15 and 16 are weekends. Then 17-20: 4 days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu). So that's 4 + 4 = 8 weekdays. Wait, but wait, 11 to 14 is 4 days, then 17-20 is 4 days. But what about the days in between? Let me check again.\n\nWait, October 11 is day 1, 12 is 2, 13 is 3, 14 is 4, 15 is 5 (Saturday), 16 is 6 (Sunday), 17 is 7 (Monday), 18 is 8 (Tuesday), 19 is 9 (Wednesday), 20 is 10 (Thursday). So total days from 11 to 20 inclusive is 10 days. Now, the weekends are days 5 and 6 (Saturday and Sunday). So the weekdays are days 1-4 (4 days) and days 7-10 (4 days). So 4 + 4 = 8 weekdays. So the answer should be 8?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the dates. Let me confirm the days of the week for each date. Let me check October 2022.\n\nLooking up October 2022 calendar. Wait, I can't actually look it up, but I can calculate based on known dates. For example, October 11, 2022 is a Tuesday.

Yes, that's correct. So the days from 11 to 20 are 10 days. The weekends are 15 and 16. So 10 total days minus 2 weekends equals 8 weekdays. So the answer is 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks between the dates. From October 11 to October 20 is 9 days (since 20-11=9, but including both ends, it's 10 days). Wait, the number of days between two dates inclusive is (end - start + 1). So 20 - 11 + 1 = 10 days. So 10 days total. Now, how many weekends are in there? Let's see. The first week starts on Tuesday, October 11. The next week starts on Monday, October 17. So between 11-14 is the first week (4 days), then 15-16 are weekends, then 17-20 is the next week (4 days).

Let's first calculate the number of days from January 1st to March 11th. Let's assume it's a non-leap year first. So January has 31 days. So January 1st is Wednesday. Then, January has 31 days, so January 31st is 30 days later. Wait, January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So to get to March 11th, I need to add the days in January and February, then add 11 days for March.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days (non-leap year), so adding 28 days. Then March 11th is 11 days after February 28th. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 69 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and March 11th is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 11 (days in March) minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I want to count the number of days from January 1st to March 11th inclusive, that would be 31 + 28 + 11 = 70 days. But if I want the number of days between January 1st and March 11th, not including January 1st, then it's 31 + 28 + 11 - 1 = 69 days. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, the number of days between two dates is the difference. So if January 1st is day 0 (Wednesday), then March 11th is 69 days later. So the total days from January 1st to March 11th is 69 days. So to find the weekday, we can compute 69 days later.\n\nBut since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, we can take 69 modulo 7. Let's calculate that. 7*9=63, 69-63=6. So 69 days later is 6 days after Wednesday. So Wednesday + 6 days. Let's count: Wednesday (0), Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4), Monday (5), Tuesday (6). So 6 days after Wednesday is Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean March 11th is Tuesday? But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1st is Wednesday, then January 8th is also Wednesday, and so on. Let me check the number of days in each month. January has 31 days. So January 1st is Wednesday. Then, January 1 + 7 days is January 8th, which is also Wednesday. Then January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Wait, March 11th is 6 days after March 5th. So March 5th is a Wednesday? Wait, let's check. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nWait, if January 1 is Wednesday, then January 1 is day 0. Then January 2 is day 1 (Thursday), and so on. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Wednesday. Then, January 1 + 30 days is January 31. 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 30 days later is 2 days after Wednesday. So January 31 is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then February 1 is Saturday. Then February has 28 days (non-leap year). So 28 days later is 28/7 = 4 weeks, so same day. So February 28 is Saturday. Then March 1 is Sunday. Then March 1 is Sunday. Then March 1 + 10 days is March 11. 10 days later. 10 divided by 7 is 1 week and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Wait, that would mean March 11 is Wednesday? But earlier calculation said 69 days later is Tuesday. There's a contradiction here. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. The first approach was to calculate the total days between January 1 and March 11. If January 1 is day 0, then March 11 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) - 1 = 69 days later? Wait, no. Wait, if you have January 1 as day 0, then January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31, and February 28 is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1 is day 59, March 11 is day 59 + 10 = day 69. So March 11 is 69 days after January 1. So 69 days later. Then 69 divided by 7 is 9*7=63, 69-63=6. So 6 days after Wednesday. So Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step counting, March 11 is Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check the step-by-step again. Let's start from January 1 as Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday (day 0)\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (day 7)\nJanuary 15: Wednesday (day 14)\nJanuary 22: Wednesday (day 21)\nJanuary 29: Wednesday (day 28)\nThen February 5: Wednesday (day 35)\nFebruary 12: Wednesday (day 42)\nFebruary 19: Wednesday (day 49)\nFebruary 26: Wednesday (day 56)\nMarch 5: Wednesday (day 63)\nMarch 12: Wednesday (day 70)\nSo March 5 is Wednesday. Then March 5 + 6 days is March 11. So March 5 is Wednesday, March 6 is Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, 11 Tuesday. So March 11 is Tuesday. But according to the previous step-by-step, I thought March 11 was Wednesday. Wait, where did I go wrong in that step?\n\nEarlier, I said that March 1 is Sunday. Let me check that again. If February 28 is Saturday (day 58), then March 1 is day 59. So day 59 is March 1. What day is that? Let's see. If day 56 is February 26 (Wednesday), then day 57 is February 27 (Thursday), day 58 is February 28 (Friday?), wait no. Wait, earlier I said that February 26 is Wednesday (day 56). Then February 27 is Thursday (57), February 28 is Friday (58). Then March 1 is Saturday (59). Wait, that contradicts my previous statement. So March 1 is Saturday. Then March 1 is Saturday. Then March 1 + 10 days is March 11. So March 1 is Saturday. Then March 1 (Saturday), 2 (Sunday), 3 (Monday), 4 (Tuesday), 5 (Wednesday), 6 (Thursday), 7 (Friday), 8 (Saturday), 9 (Sunday), 10 (Monday), 11 (Tuesday). So March 11 is Tuesday. So that matches the first calculation. So where did I go wrong in the previous step-by-step? I think I made a mistake in the earlier step where I said March 1 is Sunday. That was incorrect. So the correct day is Saturday for March 1. Therefore, March 11 is Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, why did the first calculation of 69 days later give Tuesday, which matches this. So the correct answer is Tuesday. But why did I think earlier that March 1 was Sunday? Because I must have miscalculated the days. So the correct answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to March 1. January has 31 days, so January 1 is day 0. Then February has 28 days, so March 1 is day 31 + 28 = 59. So day 59 is March 1. Now, what day is that? Let's compute 59 days after Wednesday. 59 divided by 7 is 8*7=56, remainder 3. So 59 days later is 3 days after Wednesday. Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. So March 1 is Saturday. Then March 11 is 10 days later. 10 days is 1 week (7 days) and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, March 11 is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"name the weekday of March 11\". So the answer is Tuesday. But I need to make sure that the year is not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, February would have 29 days. Let's check that scenario. If the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. So the total days from January 1 to March 11 would be 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) - 1 = 31 + 29 + 11 -1 = 70 days. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then March 11 is 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) - 1 = 31 + 29 + 11 -1 = 69 + 1 = 70? Wait, no. Wait, the total days from January 1 to March 11 is 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if you have January 1 as day 0, then January 31 is day 30. Then February 29 is day 30 + 29 = 59. Then March 1 is day 60. March 11 is day 60 + 10 = 70. So 70 days later. 70 divided by 7 is 10 weeks, so 70 days later is the same day of the week. So if January 1 is Wednesday, then March 11 would also be Wednesday. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So which is correct?\n\nBut the problem didn't specify whether it's a leap year or not. So how can we know? Wait, but the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So maybe the year is not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, then the day of the week for March 11 would be different. But how can we determine that?\n\nWait, but the problem is in a year where January 1 is Wednesday. So the year could be either a leap year or not. However, the problem is likely expecting a specific answer. So maybe the problem assumes that it's not a leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then the answer would be different. But how can we know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. But that's not the case. So perhaps the problem is set in a non-leap year. Let me check the number of days between January 1 and March 11 in a non-leap year. As we calculated, 69 days. 69 mod 7 is 6. So 6 days after Wednesday is Tuesday. In a leap year, 70 days, which is 0 mod 7, so same day, Wednesday. So the answer depends on whether it's a leap year. But the problem doesn't specify. So how can we resolve this?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if the year is a leap year, then the day of the week for March 11 would be different. But since the problem is given without any other information, maybe we need to assume that it's a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the answer is the same regardless. But that's not the case. So perhaps the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check the actual calendar for a year where January 1 is Wednesday. For example, let's take 2023. Wait, 2023 starts on a Sunday. So that's not helpful. Let me think of a year where January 1 is Wednesday. For example, 2024. Wait, 2024 is a leap year. January 1, 2024 is a Monday. Not helpful. Let me check another way. Let's take a year where January 1 is Wednesday. Let's say 2020. Wait, 2020 started on a Wednesday. Wait, no. Wait, 2020 was a leap year. January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Let me check that. Wait, according to my knowledge, January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. So that's a leap year. So in that case, March 11, 2020 would be... Let me check. Let's calculate. January 1, 2020 is Wednesday. Then March 11, 2020. Let's count the days. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Wednesday. Then February has 29 days (leap year). So March 1 is 31 + 29 = 60 days after January 1. 60 days later. 60 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 4 days. So Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. So March 1 is Sunday. Then March 11 is 10 days later. 10 days is 1 week and 3 days. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So March 11, 2020 is Wednesday. Which matches the leap year scenario. But according to the previous calculation, if it's a leap year, then March 11 is Wednesday. But if it's a non-leap year, then it's Tuesday. So the answer depends on the year. But the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So if that year is a leap year, then March 11 is Wednesday. If it's not, then Tuesday. But how can we know?\n\nWait, but the problem is presented as a general question, not tied to a specific year. So maybe the problem assumes that it's a non-leap year. But how can we be sure? Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the answer is the same regardless. But that's not the case. So perhaps the problem is in a non-leap year. But how can I know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to assume that the year is not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, then the answer would be different. But since the problem is given without any other information, maybe the answer is Tuesday. But I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let's take the non-leap year scenario. January 1 is Wednesday. Then, January 1 + 31 days is January 31."], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the fourth Sunday in December 2022. Answer with a number. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the day of the month for the fourth Sunday in December 2022. Let me start by recalling what date December 2022 started on. Wait, I think December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Let me check that. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 25 is a Sunday. Let me count backwards. If December 25 is Sunday, then December 24 is Saturday, 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday. Wait, but if December 1 is a Thursday, then December 25 would be 24 days later. Let me calculate that. 24 days divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Thursday would be Sunday. So that checks out. So December 1 is a Thursday. So that's correct.\n\nSo if December 1 is a Thursday, then the Sundays would be on the 3rd (since 1 is Thursday, 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, Thursday is the first day. So December 1 is Thursday. Then December 2 is Friday, December 3 is Saturday, December 4 is Sunday. So the first Sunday is the 4th. Then the second Sunday would be the 11th, third is 18th, fourth is 25th. Wait, but December 25 is a Sunday. So that would make the fourth Sunday the 25th. But wait, that's the fifth Sunday? Wait, no. Let me count again. First Sunday is 4th, second is 11th, third is 18th, fourth is 25th. So that's four Sundays. So the fourth Sunday would be the 25th. But wait, the question is asking for the fourth Sunday. So the answer would be 25. But wait, let me check again. Let me list all Sundays in December 2022.\n\nIf December 1 is Thursday, then:\n\nDec 4: Sunday (1st)\n\nDec 11: Sunday (2nd)\n\nDec 18: Sunday (3rd)\n\nDec 25: Sunday (4th)\n\nSo yes, the fourth Sunday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer should be 25. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me confirm December 1, 2022. Maybe I should check an actual calendar. Alternatively, I can use another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday. So 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I can check online. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, I can use the fact that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If December 25 is a Sunday, then December 25 minus 24 days is December 1. 24 days is 3 weeks and 3 days. So if December 25 is Sunday, then December 1 would be Sunday minus 3 days, which is Thursday. So that's correct. So December 1 is Thursday. Therefore, the Sundays are on 4, 11, 18, 25. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer is 25. But wait, the question says \"the fourth Sunday in December 2022\". So that's the 25th. So the answer is 25. But wait, maybe I should check if there are four Sundays. December has 31 days. So the Sundays would be on 4, 11, 18, 25. That's four Sundays. So the fourth is 25. So the answer is 25. Therefore, the answer is 25.\n</think>", "25"], [124, "Name the day of the week for 10/01/2022. State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 1st, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yes, that makes sense. So if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then each subsequent day adds one day of the week.\n\nNow, October 1st is 273 days after January 1st. Wait, how many days are there from January 1 to October 1? Let me count. January has 31 days, so 31 days in January. February has 28 days in 2022 (since it's not a leap year). March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and then October 1. So adding up the days from January to September:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\n\nSo October 1 is 273 days after January 1. So if January 1 is a Sunday, then adding 273 days. Now, since 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks exactly, because 7*39=273. So 273 days is exactly 39 weeks. Therefore, adding 273 days to Sunday would still be Sunday. Wait, that can't be right. Because if you add 7 days, it's the same day. So 273 days is 39 weeks, so October 1st would be a Sunday? But I think that's not correct because I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between January 1 and October 1.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me count the days again. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February is 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30. So adding those up:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\n\nSo October 1 is the next day, which is 274th day of the year? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 1 is day 1, and October 1 is day 273? Wait, no. Wait, if you add up the days from January 1 to September 30, that's 273 days. So October 1 is day 274. Therefore, the number of days between January 1 and October 1 is 273 days. So if January 1 is a Sunday, then adding 273 days would be 273 days later. Since 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks, exactly. So that would mean October 1 is also a Sunday. But I think that's conflicting with my memory. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about January 1, 2022 being a Sunday. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, I think I might have confused the years. Let me check an actual calendar. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year), so 2021 would start on a Thursday (since 366 days is 52 weeks and 2 days). So January 1, 2021 is Thursday. Then 2021 is 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So maybe I was wrong before. So if January 1, 2021 is Thursday, then 2021 has 365 days, so 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Thursday would be Friday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 is Friday. Then, if that's the case, then October 1, 2022 would be 273 days later. 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks, so same day. So October 1 would be Friday? But that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, but I think I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. Wait, if July 4 is a Monday, then July 4 is 21 days after June 30. Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's think about the number of days from January 1 to July 4. Let's see:\n\nJanuary: 31, February: 28, March: 31, April: 30, May: 31, June: 30, July 4. So adding up the days up to June 30: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 181 days. Then July 4 is 4 days after June 30, so total 185 days. If July 4 is Monday, then January 1 is 185 days before that. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So if July 4 is Monday, then January 1 would be 3 days before Monday, which is Friday. So that matches with the previous calculation that January 1, 2022 is Friday. Therefore, if that's correct, then October 1 is 273 days later. 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks, so same day. Therefore, October 1 would be Friday. But I thought earlier that October 1 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I was wrong. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the day of the week for October 1, 2022. Let's think about the date in 2023. For example, I know that October 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Because if 2022 is a common year (365 days), then 2022 has 52 weeks and 1 day. So October 1, 2022 would be one day before October 1, 2023. If October 1, 2023 is Sunday, then October 1, 2022 would be Saturday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, if October 1, 2023 is Sunday, then October 1, 2022 would be Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, if January 1, 2022 is Friday, then October 1 is 273 days later, which is 39 weeks, so same day, Friday. But that's conflicting with the other method. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe the assumption that October 1, 2023 is Sunday is wrong. Let me think. Let me check another way. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's true, then December 25, 2022 is Sunday. Then, December 25 is 25 days after November 1. Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's think about the number of days between October 1, 2022 and October 1, 2023. Since 2022 is not a leap year, there are 365 days between them. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So October 1, 2023 is one day after October 1, 2022. So if October 1, 2023 is Sunday, then October 1, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, that would mean that my previous calculation that January 1, 2022 is Friday is wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nLet me check again. If October 1, 2022 is Saturday, then January 1, 2022 is how many days before that? Let's calculate the number of days from January 1 to October 1. As before, 273 days. So if October 1 is Saturday, then January 1 is 273 days before. 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks. So 273 days before would be the same day of the week. Therefore, if October 1 is Saturday, then January 1 is also Saturday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought January 1, 2022 was Friday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that January 1, 2021 is Thursday. Let me check that again. I think I might have confused the years. Let me think. January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 is a leap year, so 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2021 is 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Wait, that's different from before. So if January 1, 2021 is Friday, then January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, October 1, 2022 is 273 days later. 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks, so same day. Therefore, October 1, 2022 would be Saturday. Which matches the other method where October 1, 2023 is Sunday. So that seems correct. So where did I go wrong before? Earlier, I thought that January 1, 2021 was Thursday, but that was incorrect. Actually, January 1, 2020 was Wednesday, so 2020 is a leap year, so 2021 starts on Friday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is Saturday. So the correct answer is Saturday.\n\nBut why did I think earlier that January 1, 2021 was Thursday? Maybe I confused the years. So the key here is to correctly calculate the day of the week for January 1, 2022. So if January 1, 2020 is Wednesday, then 2020 is a leap year, so 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So 2021 starts on Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2021 is 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 starts on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then October 1 is 273 days later, which is 39 weeks, so same day. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n</think>", "Saturday"], [124, "Count forward 80 days from Wednesday, July 6, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week it will be 80 days after Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Let me start by breaking this down. \n\nFirst, I know that each week has 7 days, so if I can figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 80 days, that should help me determine the weekday. Since 80 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 3 days (because 11*7=77, and 80-77=3), that means 80 days later is 11 weeks and 3 days after the starting date. \n\nSo if the starting day is Wednesday, adding 3 days would take me to Saturday. Wait, let me check that again. Wednesday plus 1 day is Thursday, plus 2 is Friday, plus 3 is Saturday. So that would make the answer Saturday? But wait, maybe I should verify this by actually counting the days step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or some kind of date calculation method. Let me think. July 6, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let me count the days forward. \n\nFirst, July has 31 days. So July 6 is Wednesday. Let's count the days in July. From July 6 to July 13 is 7 days, which is another Wednesday. Then July 13 is Wednesday. Then July 20 is Wednesday, July 27 is Wednesday. Then August 3 is Wednesday. Wait, but that's 7 days each week. So adding 7 days each time. \n\nBut I need to go 80 days. Let me see. Let's break it down into months. \n\nStarting from July 6, 2022. Let's count the days in each month:\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 6 to July 31 is 31 - 6 = 25 days. Wait, but if I start on July 6, then July 6 is day 0. Then July 7 is +1 day. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days later. Wait, but 31 - 6 = 25, but that's the number of days after July 6. So if I add 25 days to July 6, that would be July 31. Then August has 31 days. Then September has 30, October 31, etc. But maybe this approach is getting complicated. Alternatively, since I know that 80 days is 11 weeks and 3 days, then adding 3 days to Wednesday would be Saturday. But maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the days? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're starting in July, that shouldn't affect the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try another approach. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nStarting from July 6, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count 80 days forward. \n\nFirst, let's count the days in July after July 6. July has 31 days. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days (since 31 - 6 = 25). So adding 25 days to July 6 would take me to July 31. Then, 25 days later is July 31. Then, August has 31 days. So adding 31 days would take me to August 31. But 25 + 31 = 56 days. So 56 days after July 6 is August 31. Then, 80 - 56 = 24 days remaining. So 24 days after August 31 is September 24 (since August has 31 days, so August 31 + 1 day is September 1, and adding 24 days would be September 24). \n\nNow, I need to check what day of the week September 24 is. Let's see. July 6 is Wednesday. Let's check the days step by step. \n\nJuly 6 is Wednesday. July 13 is Wednesday (7 days later). July 20 is Wednesday. July 27 is Wednesday. August 3 is Wednesday. August 10 is Wednesday. August 17 is Wednesday. August 24 is Wednesday. August 31 is Wednesday. Then September 7 is Wednesday. September 14 is Wednesday. September 21 is Wednesday. September 28 is Wednesday. Wait, but September 24 is 3 days before September 28. So September 24 would be Sunday? Wait, because September 21 is Wednesday, then September 22 is Thursday, 23 is Friday, 24 is Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if September 21 is Wednesday, then adding 3 days would be Saturday. So September 24 is Saturday. \n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, 80 days after July 6 is September 24. So that would be Saturday. Which matches the initial calculation of adding 3 days to Wednesday (Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday). So that seems to confirm that the answer is Saturday. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me count the days from July 6 to September 24. \n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days. Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to August 31 (total 25 + 31 = 56 days). Then September 24 is 24 days after August 31. So 56 + 24 = 80 days. So that's correct. \n\nNow, if July 6 is Wednesday, then July 31 is 25 days later. Let's check the day of the week. Since 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So 25 days later is 3 weeks and 4 days. So Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. Wait, that would mean July 31 is Sunday? But earlier I thought that July 31 was Wednesday. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, if July 6 is Wednesday, then July 13 is Wednesday (7 days later). July 20 is Wednesday (14 days later). July 27 is Wednesday (21 days later). Then August 3 is Wednesday (28 days later). Then August 10 is Wednesday (35 days later). August 17 is Wednesday (42 days later). August 24 is Wednesday (49 days later). August 31 is Wednesday (56 days later). So that's 56 days later. So that's correct. So July 31 is 25 days after July 6. But according to the calculation, 25 days is 3 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday would be Sunday. But according to the step-by-step, July 31 is Wednesday. That's a problem. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. If July 6 is Wednesday, then July 6 + 7 days is July 13 (Wednesday). Then July 20 (Wednesday), July 27 (Wednesday). Then August 3 (Wednesday). So that's 28 days later. So July 31 is 25 days after July 6. Wait, but 28 days later is August 3. So July 31 is 28 - 3 = 25 days. So 25 days after July 6 is July 31. But according to the 25 days calculation, 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 4 days. So 3 weeks later is Wednesday, plus 4 days would be Sunday. But according to the step-by-step, July 31 is Wednesday. That's conflicting. So there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the days. Let me check. Let's count the days from July 6 to July 31. July 6 is day 0. July 7 is day 1. July 13 is day 7. July 20 is day 14. July 27 is day 21. August 3 is day 28. So July 31 is day 25. So day 25. So 25 days after July 6. So 25 divided by 7 is 3*7=21, remainder 4. So 3 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday would be Sunday. But according to the step-by-step, July 31 is Wednesday. That's a contradiction. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe the step-by-step is wrong. Let me check. If July 6 is Wednesday, then July 7 is Thursday. July 8 is Friday. July 9 is Saturday. July 10 is Sunday. July 11 is Monday. July 12 is Tuesday. July 13 is Wednesday. So that's correct. So July 13 is Wednesday. Then July 20 is Wednesday. July 27 is Wednesday. Then August 3 is Wednesday. So August 3 is 28 days after July 6. So July 31 is 28 - 3 = 25 days after July 6. But according to the day count, July 31 is 25 days after July 6. But according to the calculation, that should be 25 days later. So if July 6 is Wednesday, then 25 days later is 3 weeks and 4 days. So Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. But according to the step-by-step, July 31 is Wednesday. That's impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake in my reasoning here. \n\nWait, maybe I'm counting the days wrong. Let me check. Let's count the days from July 6 to July 31. Let's count the number of days between July 6 and July 31 inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if July 6 is day 0, then July 7 is day 1. So July 31 is day 25. So 25 days after July 6. But if July 6 is Wednesday, then adding 25 days would be 25 days later. But according to the step-by-step, July 31 is 25 days after July 6. But according to the step-by-step, July 31 is Wednesday. But according to the 25 days calculation, it should be Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step. \n\nWait, let me check again. Let's count the days from July 6 to July 31. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nJuly 6: Wednesday (day 0)\nJuly 7: Thursday (1)\nJuly 8: Friday (2)\nJuly 9: Saturday (3)\nJuly 10: Sunday (4)\nJuly 11: Monday (5)\nJuly 12: Tuesday (6)\nJuly 13: Wednesday (7)\nJuly 14: Thursday (8)\nJuly 15: Friday (9)\nJuly 16: Saturday (10)\nJuly 17: Sunday (11)\nJuly 18: Monday (12)\nJuly 19: Tuesday (13)\nJuly 20: Wednesday (14)\nJuly 21: Thursday (15)\nJuly 22: Friday (16)\nJuly 23: Saturday (17)\nJuly 24: Sunday (18)\nJuly 25: Monday (19)\nJuly 26: Tuesday (20)\nJuly 27: Wednesday (21)\nJuly 28: Thursday (22)\nJuly 29: Friday (23)\nJuly 30: Saturday (24)\nJuly 31: Sunday (25)\n\nOh! So July 31 is Sunday. So that's the correct day. So my previous step-by-step was wrong. I thought that July 31 was Wednesday, but that's incorrect. So that's where the mistake was. So July 31 is Sunday. Therefore, the initial calculation of 25 days later is Sunday, which is correct. So that means that my initial step-by-step was wrong. So that's a key point. \n\nSo, if July 6 is Wednesday, then July 31 is Sunday. Then, adding 31 days (August 31) would be 25 + 31 = 56 days. So August 31 is 56 days after July 6. Then, adding 24 days to August 31 would be September 24. So 56 + 24 = 80 days. Now, let's check what day of the week September 24 is. \n\nAugust 31 is Sunday (since July 31 is Sunday, and August 31 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Wait, August 31 is 31 days after July 31. July 31 is Sunday. Adding 31 days: 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks (28 days) and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Therefore, August 31 is Wednesday. Then, September 24 is 24 days after August 31. \n\nSo August 31 is Wednesday. Then September 1 is Thursday. September 2 is Friday. September 3 is Saturday. September 4 is Sunday. September 5 is Monday. September 6 is Tuesday. September 7 is Wednesday. September 8 is Thursday. September 9 is Friday. September 10 is Saturday. September 11 is Sunday. September 12 is Monday. September 13 is Tuesday. September 14 is Wednesday. September 15 is Thursday. September 16 is Friday. September 17 is Saturday. September 18 is Sunday. September 19 is Monday. September 20 is Tuesday. September 21 is Wednesday. September 22 is Thursday. September 23 is Friday. September 24 is Saturday. \n\nSo September 24 is Saturday. Therefore, 80 days after July 6 is Saturday. Which matches the initial calculation of adding 3 days to Wednesday (Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday). So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n</think>", "Saturday"], [124, "If a meeting is scheduled on the second Thursday of May 2022, on which day of the month does it occur? Reply with the numerical value. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out on which date in May 2022 the second Thursday falls. Let me start by recalling that May has 31 days. First, I should check what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I can check an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I'll have to rely on my memory or logical reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me think. Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's see, if I can find the day of the week for a known date in May 2022. For example, I know that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that again. If that's correct, then the first week of May would start on Sunday, May 1. So the first Thursday would be May 5th, right? Because May 1 is Sunday, then the next days: 2 (Mon), 3 (Tue), 4 (Wed), 5 (Thu). So first Thursday is May 5. Then the second Thursday would be May 12th. Wait, but wait, if May 5 is the first Thursday, then adding seven days would be May 12, which is the second Thursday. Then the third would be May 19, and the fourth May 26. But since May has 31 days, the fifth Thursday would be June 2nd, but that's next month. So the second Thursday is May 12. Therefore, the answer should be 12. But wait, I need to make sure that May 1, 2022, was indeed a Sunday. Let me think again. Let me check another way. For example, I know that May 2022 had a certain number of days. Let me think about the days of the week for some other dates. For example, if I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday. So first Thursday is 5th. Then the second would be 12th. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 12. But wait, maybe I should check another date. For example, if I know that May 13, 2022, was a Friday. Then May 12 would be Thursday. So that's correct. So the second Thursday is May 12. Therefore, the answer is 12. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial day. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022, was a Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday, and so on. Then, how many days are there between January 1 and May 1? Let's calculate. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March has 31, April has 30. So May 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120 days. So May 1 is 120 days after January 1. If January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 120 days. Let's compute 120 divided by 7. 7*17=119, so 120 days is 17 weeks and 1 day. So January 1 is Saturday, adding 17 weeks (119 days) brings us to January 1 + 119 days, which is also a Saturday. Then adding one more day (120th day) would be Sunday. Therefore, May 1, 2022, is a Sunday. So that confirms my initial thought. Therefore, the first Thursday is May 5, second is May 12. So the answer is 12. Therefore, the answer should be 12.\n</think>", "12"], [124, "What day of the week was June 15, 2022? Provide the full name of the weekday.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 15, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no, because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021 was a Monday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 15, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about some other dates. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, July 4, 2022, I think that's a Monday. Let me check. Wait, if I can remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards. Let's see. June has 30 days. So June 15 is 15 days before July 1. Wait, July 1 is 15 days after June 15. Wait, no, June 15 plus 15 days is July 1. Wait, June has 30 days, so June 15 plus 15 days is June 30 (15 days later) plus 1 day is July 1. So if July 1 is 15 days after June 15. So if July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 would be 3 days before that. So July 1 would be a Friday. Wait, because July 1 is three days before July 4. So if July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Monday minus 3 days, which is Friday. So July 1 is a Friday. Then June 15 is 15 days before July 1. So if July 1 is Friday, then June 15 would be 15 days earlier. Let me count backwards. 15 days before July 1 is June 15. So if July 1 is Friday, then June 15 would be 15 days before. Let's break it down. Let's count the days. Let's say July 1 is Friday. Then June 24 is also a Friday (since June has 30 days, so June 24 is 24th, then June 25 is Saturday, 26 Sunday, 27 Monday, 28 Tuesday, 29 Wednesday, 30 Thursday. Then July 1 is Friday. So June 24 is Friday. Then June 15 is 9 days before June 24. So June 15 would be 9 days before Friday. Let's count: June 15 + 9 days is June 24. So June 15 would be Friday minus 9 days. Let's count backwards. Friday minus 1 day is Thursday (June 14), minus 2 is Wednesday (June 13), minus 3 is Tuesday (June 12), minus 4 is Monday (June 11), minus 5 is Sunday (June 10), minus 6 is Saturday (June 9), minus 7 is Friday (June 8), minus 8 is Thursday (June 7), minus 9 is Wednesday (June 6). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Wait, if June 24 is Friday, then June 15 is 9 days earlier. So June 24 minus 9 days is June 15. Let me count backwards from June 24. June 24 (Friday) minus 1 day is June 23 (Thursday), minus 2 is June 22 (Wednesday), minus 3 is June 21 (Tuesday), minus 4 is June 20 (Monday), minus 5 is June 19 (Sunday), minus 6 is June 18 (Saturday), minus 7 is June 17 (Friday), minus 8 is June 16 (Thursday), minus 9 is June 15 (Wednesday). So June 15 would be a Wednesday? But wait, if July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is Friday, and June 15 is Wednesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming July 4 is a Monday. Let me check that. Wait, I think July 4, 2022 was actually a Monday. Let me confirm. Wait, I can check online, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think. Let's take another known date. For example, I know that June 15, 2022 is the date in question. Let me think of another way. Let's take January 1, 2022. If I can figure out what day that was, then I can count forward. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but earlier I thought that 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 would start on a Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I need to check that again. Let me think. 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021 was a Monday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, but if that's the case, then January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Then, let's count the days from January 1, 2022 to June 15, 2022. Let's see. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 1). Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March has 31, April 30, May 31, and June 15. So total days from January 1 to June 15 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 15 (June) = let's calculate that. 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 31 is 151, plus 15 is 166 days. So 166 days from January 1, 2022. Now, if January 1 is a Tuesday, then adding 166 days. Since 7 days a week, 166 divided by 7 is 23 weeks and 5 days. So 23 weeks is 161 days, so 166 - 161 = 5 days. So adding 5 days to Tuesday. Tuesday + 1 is Wednesday, +2 Thursday, +3 Friday, +4 Saturday, +5 Sunday. So June 15, 2022 would be a Sunday? But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought it was Wednesday. So which one is correct? There's a discrepancy here. So I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check again. First, the first method: assuming July 4 is Monday. If July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Friday. Then June 15 is Wednesday. But according to the second method, if January 1 is Tuesday, then June 15 is Sunday. Which one is correct? Alternatively, maybe my assumption that July 4 is a Monday is wrong. Let me think. Let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then July 4 would be Monday. So that would make sense. So if July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday. So that would mean that June 15 is Wednesday. But according to the other method, it's Sunday. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations. Let me check the first method again. If January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday, then adding 166 days. Let me check the number of days again. January 1 to June 15. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 15. So total days from January 1 to June 15 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 15 (June) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+31=151, 151+15=166. That's correct. So 166 days. 166 divided by 7 is 23*7=161, remainder 5. So 5 days after Tuesday is Sunday. So that would mean June 15 is Sunday. But according to the other method, it's Wednesday. So which is correct? Maybe my assumption that July 1 is Friday is wrong. Let me check. If July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday. But if July 1 is Friday, then June 15 is Wednesday. But according to the other calculation, it's Sunday. So there's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check the first method again. If July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is 3 days before that. So July 4 minus 3 days is July 1. July 4 is Monday, so July 1 is Monday minus 3 days. Monday minus 1 day is Sunday, minus 2 is Saturday, minus 3 is Friday. So July 1 is Friday. Then June 15 is 15 days before July 1. So June 15 is 15 days before July 1. Let me count that again. If July 1 is Friday, then June 24 is also Friday. Then June 15 is 9 days before June 24. So June 15 is 9 days before Friday. Let's count backwards. June 24 (Friday) minus 1 day is June 23 (Thursday), minus 2 is June 22 (Wednesday), minus 3 is June 21 (Tuesday), minus 4 is June 20 (Monday), minus 5 is June 19 (Sunday), minus 6 is June 18 (Saturday), minus 7 is June 17 (Friday), minus 8 is June 16 (Thursday), minus 9 is June 15 (Wednesday). So that would make June 15 a Wednesday. But according to the other method, it's Sunday. So which is correct? There's a problem here. Maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday is wrong. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday, then January 1, 2021 was a Monday (since 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day). So 2021 started on Monday, 2022 started on Tuesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday. Let me check that. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year), so 2021 started on a Wednesday + 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. So January 1, 2021 was a Friday? Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I need to check that again. Wait, 2020 was a leap year, so 366 days. So 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So if January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday, then January 1, 2021 would be Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. So that would mean that 2021 started on a Friday. Then 2022 would start on Friday + 1 day (since 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day). So 2022 would start on Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. So if January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. So that would mean that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday was wrong. So that's where the mistake was. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 166 days would be 166 divided by 7 is 23 weeks and 5 days. So Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. Wait, Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 Monday, +3 Tuesday, +4 Wednesday, +5 Thursday. So June 15 would be a Thursday? But that contradicts the other method. Now I'm really confused. So I need to figure out the correct day for January 1, 2022. Let me try to find a reliable way. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. If that's correct, then July 1 is Friday. Then June 15 is Wednesday. But if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then June 15 would be Thursday. So there's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check the leap year calculation again. January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. 2020 is a leap year, so 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So 2021 starts on Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. So January 1, 2021 is Friday. Then 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 starts on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, if that's correct, then June 15, 2022 is 166 days later. 166 divided by 7 is 23*7=161, remainder 5. So Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. But according to the other method, if July 4 is Monday, then June 15 is Wednesday. So which is correct? Let me check another way. Let's take July 1, 2022. If July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday. So that would mean that July 1 is Friday. But if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then let's count the days from January 1 to July 1. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 1. So total days from January 1 to July 1 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 1 = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +1=152 days. So 152 days from January 1, 2022 (Saturday). 152 divided by 7 is 21 weeks and 5 days. So 21*7=147, 152-147=5. So Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. So July 1 would be a Thursday. But that contradicts the previous assumption that July 1 is Friday. So there's a problem here. Therefore, my assumption that July 4 is Monday must be wrong. So where is the mistake? If July 1 is Thursday, then July 4 is Sunday. So that would mean that July 4 is Sunday. But I thought it was Monday. So maybe I was wrong about that. Therefore, the correct day for July 4 is Sunday. So if July 1 is Thursday, then July 4 is Sunday. So that would mean that June 15 is 15 days before July 1. Let's count that again. July 1 is Thursday. June 24 is also Thursday. Then June 15 is 9 days before June 24. So June 15 is Thursday minus 9 days. Let's count backwards. June"]]}
