Give the count numerically. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the first Wednesday of May 2022. Let me start by recalling what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use some known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, counting the days for May... Wait, maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use an online calendar or a day calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to remember or calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May has 31 days. Let me think. If I can find the day of the week for May 1, then I can count forward. Let me try to recall. Wait, I think May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me confirm. For example, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday would be May 4th. But wait, is that correct? Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then the first Wednesday is the 4th. But maybe I'm wrong about the day of the week for May 1. Let me think again. Let's take another approach. Let's check some known dates. For example, April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days later. Since 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 1 is Friday, adding 2 days would make May 1 a Sunday. Yes, that seems right. So May 1 is Sunday. Therefore, the first Wednesday is May 4. So the answer should be 4. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think of another date. For example, May 6, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if May 4 is Wednesday, then May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday. That seems correct. So yes, the first Wednesday is the 4th. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n</think>", "4"], [99, "Between Tuesday, November 8, 2022 and Friday, December 16, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Answer with a number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, November 8, 2022, and Friday, December 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week's days in that period.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. November 8, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to remember or calculate. Let me think. November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday? Let me check. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me count. If November 1 is Tuesday, then November 8 would be the next Tuesday. So yes, November 8 is a Tuesday. Then the period starts on Tuesday, November 8, and ends on Friday, December 16. So I need to count all the days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive, then subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe break it down into weeks. Let's see. Let's first find the total number of days between the two dates. Let's calculate the number of days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive.\n\nFirst, November has 30 days. So from November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 = 22 days, but since we include both start and end dates, it's 22 + 1 = 23 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have from day X to day Y inclusive, the number of days is Y - X + 1. So November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. So total days would be 23 + 16 = 39 days. Wait, but wait, November 8 to November 30 is 23 days, then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. So total days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive is 23 + 16 = 39 days. Let me check that again. Let's take November 8 as day 1. Then November 9 is day 2, ..., November 30 is day 23. Then December 1 is day 24, and December 16 is day 24 + 15 = day 39. Yes, that's correct. So total days is 39.\n\nNow, out of these 39 days, how many are weekends? Let's find the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nFirst, let's note that November 8 is a Tuesday. So the first day is Tuesday. Let's list the days of the week for each date.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tuesday):\n\nWeek 1: Nov 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun). So the first week has 6 days, with Saturday and Sunday being weekends. So in this week, 2 weekend days.\n\nThen November 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun). So the next week (Nov 14-20) has 2 weekend days again.\n\nThen November 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Another week with 2 weekend days.\n\nThen November 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), Dec 1 (Thu), Dec 2 (Fri), Dec 3 (Sat), Dec 4 (Sun). So that's another week with 2 weekend days.\n\nThen Dec 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun). So that's another week with 2 weekend days.\n\nThen Dec 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri). Wait, the end date is Dec 16, which is a Friday. So the last week here is from Dec 12 to Dec 16. That's 5 days, with no weekends. So in this last week, there are no weekend days.\n\nSo let's count the number of weeks and the weekend days. Let's see:\n\nFirst, from Nov 8 to Nov 16: that's 9 days (Nov 8 to Nov 16 inclusive). Wait, but earlier I split into weeks. Wait, maybe I need to check how many full weeks there are and then the remaining days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of weekends in each month.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to count the number of Saturdays and Sundays between Nov 8 and Dec 16.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, November 8 is a Tuesday. So the first Saturday in November would be November 12 (since Nov 8 is Tuesday, 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat). Then the next Saturday is 19, 26, and then December 3, 10, 17, etc.\n\nSo let's list all the Saturdays and Sundays between Nov 8 and Dec 16.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nNov 12, 19, 26.\n\nThen Dec 3, 10, 17. But Dec 17 is after Dec 16, so only up to Dec 10.\n\nSo Saturdays in the period: Nov 12, 19, 26, Dec 3, 10. That's 5 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\nNov 13, 20, 27. Then Dec 4, 11. Dec 18 is after Dec 16, so only up to Dec 11.\n\nSo Sundays in the period: Nov 13, 20, 27, Dec 4, 11. That's 5 Sundays.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check each date.\n\nStarting with Nov 8 (Tuesday). So the first Saturday is Nov 12. Then next Saturday is Nov 19, then Nov 26. Then Dec 3, Dec 10. So that's 5 Saturdays. Then Sundays: Nov 13 (Sunday), then Nov 20, Nov 27. Then Dec 4, Dec 11. So that's 5 Sundays. So total weekends are 5 + 5 = 10 days.\n\nBut wait, let me check if Dec 27 is included? No, the end date is Dec 16. So Dec 27 is beyond. So yes, the Sundays up to Dec 11. So that's 5 Sundays.\n\nSo total weekends are 10 days. Therefore, total business days would be total days (39) minus 10 weekends, which is 29 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check each week again.\n\nFirst, from Nov 8 to Nov 16: that's 9 days. Let's check the weekends here. Nov 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun). So two weekends. Then Nov 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun) in the next week. Then Nov 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Then Dec 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun). Then Dec 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun). But Dec 16 is the end date. So from Dec 12 to Dec 16 is 5 days (Mon to Fri). So the weekends in the period are:\n\nSaturdays: Nov 12, 19, 26, Dec 3, 10. That's 5.\n\nSundays: Nov 13, 20, 27, Dec 4, 11. That's 5. So total 10. So 39 total days minus 10 weekends is 29 business days. But wait, let me check again. Let me count the total days again. From Nov 8 to Dec 16 inclusive is 39 days. Let me check that again. November has 30 days. From Nov 8 to Nov 30 is 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Then Dec 1 to Dec 16 is 16 days. 23 + 16 = 39. Correct. So 39 days total. 10 weekends. So 39 - 10 = 29. So the answer is 29?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check each date.\n\nLet me list all the dates from Nov 8 to Dec 16 and check which are weekends.\n\nStarting with Nov 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), Dec 1 (Thu), 2 (Fri), 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri).\n\nNow, let's count the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this list.\n\nSaturdays: Nov 12, 19, 26, Dec 3, 10. That's 5.\n\nSundays: Nov 13, 20, 27, Dec 4, 11. That's 5. So total 10. So 10 weekends. So 39 - 10 = 29 business days. So the answer is 29?\n\nBut wait, let me check the list again. Let's count the number of weekends in the list.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\nNov 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun). That's 10 days. Yes. So 10 weekends. So 39-10=29. So the answer is 29.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when I list the dates, the first Saturday is Nov 12, then Sunday Nov 13. Then next Saturday is Nov 19, Sunday Nov 20. Then Saturday Nov 26, Sunday Nov 27. Then Dec 3 (Sat), Dec 4 (Sun), Dec 10 (Sat), Dec 11 (Sun). That's 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. So 10 days. So 39-10=29. So the answer is 29. But I need to make sure that the total days is correct. Let me count the days again. From Nov 8 to Dec 16 inclusive. Let's count the days in November: 30 days. So from Nov 8 to Nov 30 is 23 days. Then Dec 1 to Dec 16 is 16 days. 23+16=39. Correct. So 39 days. So 39-10=29. So the answer is 29. But wait, I think I remember that sometimes when you count days, you might have an off-by-one error. Let me check another way. Let's count the number of business days by weeks.\n\nFrom Nov 8 (Tuesday) to Dec 16 (Friday). Let's see how many weeks there are. Let's see, Nov 8 is Tuesday. Then the next week is Nov 15 (Tuesday). Then Nov 22 (Tuesday), Nov 29 (Tuesday), Dec 6 (Tuesday), Dec 13 (Tuesday). So the weeks are:\n\nWeek 1: Nov 8-14 (Tue to Mon). Wait, Nov 8 is Tuesday, then Nov 14 is Monday. So that's 7 days. Then next week is Nov 15 (Tue) to Nov 21 (Mon). Then Nov 22 (Tue) to Nov 28 (Mon). Then Nov 29 (Tue) to Dec 5 (Mon). Then Dec 6 (Tue) to Dec 12 (Mon). Then Dec 13 (Tue) to Dec 19 (Mon). But our end date is Dec 16, which is Friday. So the last week is Dec 13 (Tue) to Dec 16 (Fri). So let's count the business days in each week.\n\nFirst week: Nov 8 (Tue) to Nov 14 (Mon). That's 7 days. Business days are Tue to Fri (4 days) and Mon (1 day) is included? Wait, no. Wait, the week is from Nov 8 (Tue) to Nov 14 (Mon). So the days are:\n\nNov 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon). So business days are Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon. That's 5 business days. Wait, but the weekend days are Sat and Sun. So 5 business days in this week.\n\nSecond week: Nov 15 (Tue) to Nov 21 (Mon). Same structure. Business days: Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon. 5 days.\n\nThird week: Nov 22 (Tue) to Nov 28 (Mon). Again 5 business days.\n\nFourth week: Nov 29 (Tue) to Dec 5 (Mon). 5 business days.\n\nFifth week: Dec 6 (Tue) to Dec 12 (Mon). 5 business days.\n\nSixth week: Dec 13 (Tue) to Dec 16 (Fri). That's 4 days (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri). So 4 business days.\n\nSo total business days would be 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 29. Yes! That matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 29. Therefore, the total number of business days is 29.\n</think>", "29"], [99, "Tell me whether 1940 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1940 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1940 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1940 divided by 4. 4 times 485 is 1940, right? Because 4 times 500 is 2000, subtract 4 times 15 which is 60, so 2000 - 60 = 1940. So 485 times 4 is 1940. That means 1940 is divisible by 4. So that's the first condition satisfied.\n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. So 1940 divided by 100 is 19.4. Wait, that's not an integer. So 1940 is not a century year. Therefore, the second condition (divisible by 400) doesn't apply here. Since it's not a century year, and it's divisible by 4, then according to the rules, it should be a leap year.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me calculate 1940 divided by 100 again. 100 times 19 is 1900, and 1940 minus 1900 is 40. So 1940 is 19.4 times 100, which is not a whole number. So yes, it's not a century year. Therefore, the only condition that matters is being divisible by 4, which it is. So 1940 should be a leap year. \n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be Yes.\n</think>", "Yes"], [99, "Determine the day of the month for the second Tuesday in November 2022. Give the count numerically.

Let me start by recalling what day November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then August 1 was a Monday, September 1 was a Thursday, October 1 was a Saturday, and November 1 would be a Tuesday. Wait, that seems right. Let me count the days between July 1 and November 1. July has 31 days, so July 1 to July 31 is 30 days later. August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. September has 30, and October has 31. Wait, but from July 1 to November 1 is 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) minus 1 day for each month? Wait, no. Wait, if July 1 is day 1, then adding 30 days would be August 1.

Wait, but that's from July 1 to November 1. Wait, but if July 1 is a Friday, then adding 122 days. Let me check the day of the week. 122 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 3 days. So Friday plus 3 days is Monday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should check an online calendar or use another method. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Wait, I think I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me think again. Let's take a known date. For example, December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Then November 1 would be 30 days before. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if December 1 is Thursday, then November 1 would be Thursday minus 2 days, which is Tuesday. Yes, that makes sense. So November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Therefore, the first Tuesday is the 1st. Then the second Tuesday would be the 8th. Wait, because the first is 1, then adding 7 days is 8. So the second Tuesday is the 8th. Therefore, the answer should be 8. But wait, let me confirm. Let me check the actual calendar for November 2022. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can use my knowledge. Let me think again. If November 1 is Tuesday, then the Tuesdays are 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. So the second one is the 8th. Therefore, the answer is 8. But wait, the question says \"the second Tuesday\". So first is 1, second is 8. So the answer is 8. But maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for November 1. Let me check again. Let's take another approach. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then, let's count the days. Let's see, January has 31 days, so February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1, 2022, was a Wednesday. March 1 is 28 days later (2022 is not a leap year), so 28 days is exactly 4 weeks. So March 1 is Wednesday. April 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 is Saturday. May 1 is 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 is Monday. June 1 is 31 days later. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So June 1 is Thursday. July 1 is 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So July 1 is Saturday. Wait, but earlier I thought July 1 was a Friday. Hmm, this is conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. January 1, 2022, is Sunday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, remainder 3. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. That's correct. March 1 is 28 days after February 1, which is exactly 4 weeks, so same day, Wednesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. That's correct. May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Correct. June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Monday + 3 days is Thursday. Correct. July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. Wait, but earlier I thought July 1 was a Friday. So which is correct? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my previous assumption. Let me check. If July 1, 2022, is a Saturday, then August 1 is 31 days later. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. Then September 1 is 31 days after August 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Friday + 2 days is Sunday. November 1 is 31 days after October 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous conclusion that November 1 was a Tuesday. So now I'm confused. Which is correct? Let me check again. If July 1 is Saturday, then August 1 is Tuesday. Then September 1 is Friday. October 1 is Sunday. November 1 is Wednesday. But that would mean that November 1, 2022, was a Wednesday. But earlier I thought it was a Tuesday. So which is correct? Maybe I need to check another way. Let me check the actual calendar. Wait, I can't access the internet, but maybe I can use another method. Let me check the day of the week for a known date in November 2022. For example, November 4, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if November 1 is Wednesday, then November 4 is Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe I should check the day of the week for a specific date. For example, I know that November 25, 2022, was a Friday. Let me see. If November 1 is Wednesday, then November 25 is 24 days later. 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. But November 25 was a Friday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my previous calculation must be wrong. So where is the mistake? Let me start over. January 1, 2022, is Sunday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Correct. March 1 is 28 days later (February has 28 days in 2022). 28 mod 7 is 0. So March 1 is Wednesday. April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. Correct. May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Correct. June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Monday + 3 days is Thursday. Correct. July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. Correct. August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. Correct. September 1 is 31 days after August 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. Correct. October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Friday + 2 days is Sunday. Correct. November 1 is 31 days after October 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So according to this, November 1, 2022, is Wednesday. But then November 25 is 24 days later. 24 mod 7 is 3. Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. But I thought November 25 was a Friday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption. Alternatively, maybe my knowledge about November 25 is wrong. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check that. If November 1 is Tuesday, then November 25 is 24 days later. 24 mod 7 is 3. Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. Which matches the assumption that November 25 was a Friday. So that would mean that November 1 is Tuesday. Therefore, my previous calculation must have an error. Where is the mistake? Let me check again. If July 1 is Saturday, then August 1 is Tuesday. Then September 1 is Friday. October 1 is Sunday. November 1 is Wednesday. But that would make November 25 a Saturday. But if November 1 is Tuesday, then November 25 is Friday. So which is correct? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the days between July 1 and November 1. Let me count the days between July 1 and November 1. July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 31 is 30 days. August has 31 days, September 30, October 31. So from July 1 to November 1 is 30 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, July 1 to August 1 is 31 days. August 1 to September 1 is 31 days. September 1 to October 1 is 30 days. October 1 to November 1 is 31 days. So total days from July 1 to November 1 is 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 123 days. Wait, but that's from July 1 to November 1 inclusive? No, if you add July 1 to August 1, that's 31 days. So July 1 to August 1 is 31 days. Then August 1 to September 1 is another 31 days. September 1 to October 1 is 30 days. October 1 to November 1 is 31 days. So total is 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 123 days. So from July 1 to November 1 is 123 days. If July 1 is a Saturday, then 123 days later is November 1. 123 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 4 days. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. So November 1 is Wednesday. But if November 1 is Tuesday, then that would mean that the number of days between July 1 and November 1 is 122 days. 122 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. Therefore, if July 1 is Saturday, then November 1 is Wednesday. But if November 1 is Tuesday, then July 1 must be Saturday minus 3 days, which is Wednesday. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to check another way. Let me check the actual day of the week for a specific date. For example, I know that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. If November 1 is Tuesday, then November 4 is Friday. That's correct. So that would mean that November 1 is Tuesday. Therefore, my previous calculation must have an error. Where is the mistake? Let me check the days again. If July 1 is Saturday, then August 1 is Tuesday. Then September 1 is Friday. October 1 is Sunday. November 1 is Wednesday. But that would make November 4 a Saturday. But according to the known fact, November 4 is Friday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that July 1 is Saturday must be wrong. So where is the error in the previous calculation? Let me check again. January 1, 2022, is Sunday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Correct. March 1 is 28 days later (February 2022 has 28 days). 28 mod 7 is 0. So March 1 is Wednesday. Correct. April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. Correct. May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Correct. June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Monday + 3 days is Thursday. Correct. July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. Correct. August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. Correct. September 1 is 31 days after August 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. Correct. October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Friday + 2 days is Sunday. Correct. November 1 is 31 days after October 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So according to this, November 1 is Wednesday. But if November 4 is Friday, then November 1 must be Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the day of the week for January 1, 2022. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me check. I think January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, no. Wait, I think I remember that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. But I thought it was a Sunday. Wait, maybe that's the error. Let me check. Let me think about the year 2021. January 1, 2021, was a Friday. Then 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022, would be a Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022, is Saturday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. Wait, but earlier I said February 1 was Wednesday. That's the mistake! Oh no! I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. If January 1, 2022, is Saturday, then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is 28 days later (February 2022 has 28 days). 28 mod 7 is 0. So March 1 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Friday + 2 days is Sunday. June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Friday + 3 days is Monday. September 1 is 31 days after August"], [99, "Given that January 1 fell on a Saturday, which weekday occurs on January 10? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that January 1st fell on a Saturday, and I need to figure out what day of the week January 10th is. Alright, so first, I need to remember that each week has 7 days. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 7 days would bring me back to the same day. So January 8th would also be a Saturday. Then January 9th would be Sunday, and January 10th would be Monday. Wait, is that right?\n\nLet me check again. Let's count each day step by step. January 1 is Saturday. Then:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\n\nJanuary 2: Sunday\n\nJanuary 3: Monday\n\nJanuary 4: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 5: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 6: Thursday\n\nJanuary 7: Friday\n\nJanuary 8: Saturday (that's 7 days later, so same day)\n\nJanuary 9: Sunday\n\nJanuary 10: Monday\n\nYes, that seems correct. So January 10th would be a Monday. Wait, but maybe I should consider if there's any leap year or something? But the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. It just says January 1 is a Saturday. So I think it's safe to assume that the days are just moving normally. So the answer should be Monday. Let me just confirm once more. From 1st to 10th is 9 days later. Since 7 days is a week, 9 divided by 7 is 1 week and 2 days. So Saturday plus 2 days is Monday. Yep, that matches. So the answer is Monday.\n</think>", "Monday"], [99, "Count forward 51 days from Friday, November 11, 2022 - what's the weekday? Answer with the weekday's name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it will be 51 days after Friday, November 11, 2022. Hmm, so first, I should probably figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 51 days because weeks cycle every 7 days. \n\nSo, 51 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 7 is 49, so that's 7 weeks, which is 49 days. That leaves 2 days remaining. So 51 days is 7 weeks and 2 days. Since the starting day is Friday, adding 7 weeks would still be Friday, right? Then adding 2 more days. Friday plus one day is Saturday, plus another day is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the date? Wait, November 11, 2022, is a Friday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're starting in November, maybe that's not an issue here. But maybe I should check if the calculation of 51 days is correct. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. The day of the week cycles every 7 days. So 51 mod 7. Let me compute that. 7*7=49, 51-49=2. So 51 mod 7 is 2. So adding 2 days to Friday. Friday + 1 day is Saturday, +2 is Sunday. So that seems to confirm the same answer. \n\nBut maybe I should check with an actual calendar? Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can think of another way. Let's see, November 11 is Friday. Let's count forward. November has 30 days, so November 11 + 7 days is November 18 (Friday), then November 25 (Friday). Then December 2 (Friday). Then December 9 (Friday), December 16 (Friday), December 23 (Friday), December 30 (Friday). Then January 6, 13, 20, 27, 2023. Wait, but that's adding 7 weeks. So 51 days is 7 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Friday would be Sunday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates. Let's see, November 11 is Friday. Let's count 51 days. Let's break it down into months. November has 30 days. So from November 11 to November 30 is 19 days (since 30-11=19, but including the start day? Wait, no. If I start on November 11, then November 12 is +1 day. So from November 11 to November 30 is 19 days later. Wait, 30-11=19, but if you include the start day, it's 20 days. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. Let me think. If I add 1 day to November 11, it's November 12. So the number of days between November 11 and November 12 is 1 day. So from November 11 to November 30 is 19 days. Because 30-11=19. So November 11 + 19 days is November 30. Then, adding 51-19=32 days. So November 30 is Friday. Then December has 31 days. So from November 30 to December 31 is 31 days. But 32 days would be December 31 plus 1 day, which is January 1. Wait, but that's 32 days. Wait, November 30 is day 0 (Friday). Then adding 32 days. Let me check: 32 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 4 days. So 4 weeks later is Friday again, then adding 4 days: Friday + 4 days is Tuesday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous answer. Wait, this is confusing. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe my initial calculation was wrong. Because if 51 days is 7 weeks and 2 days, then adding 2 days to Friday is Sunday. But according to this breakdown, adding 19 days (to November 30) is Friday, then adding 32 days. 32 days is 4 weeks and 4 days. So 4 weeks later is Friday again, then 4 days more: Friday + 4 days is Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday? But that's conflicting with the previous answer. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, the total days from November 11 to November 30 is 19 days. So November 11 + 19 days is November 30. Then adding 32 days to November 30 would be 32 days later. But 32 days is 4 weeks (28 days) plus 4 days. So November 30 + 28 days is December 28 (since November 30 + 7 days is December 7, then +7 is 14, +7 is 21, +7 is 28). Then adding 4 days: December 28 + 1 day is December 29 (Saturday), +2 is December 30 (Sunday), +3 is December 31 (Monday), +4 is January 1 (Tuesday). So that would be Tuesday. But according to the first method, adding 51 days is 7 weeks and 2 days, so Friday + 2 days is Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. So where is the error? Let me check the initial calculation. 51 divided by 7 is 7*7=49, remainder 2. So 51 days is 7 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Friday should be Sunday. But according to the breakdown, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me check the dates again. Let's count the days step by step. Starting from November 11, 2022, which is a Friday. Let's count 51 days forward.\n\nFirst, November has 30 days. So November 11 + 19 days is November 30. So that's 19 days. Then December has 31 days. So from November 30 to December 31 is 31 days. So adding 31 days to November 30 would be December 31. Then adding 1 more day (total 32 days) would be January 1, 2023. So total days from November 11 to January 1 is 19 + 31 + 1 = 51 days? Wait, no. Wait, November 11 to November 30 is 19 days. Then November 30 to December 31 is 31 days. So 19 + 31 = 50 days. Then adding one more day (January 1) is 51 days. So that's correct. So November 11 + 51 days is January 1, 2023. Now, what day is January 1, 2023?\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, adding 51 days is 7 weeks and 2 days, so Friday + 2 days is Sunday. But according to the breakdown, adding 19 days (November 30) is Friday, then adding 32 days (which is 4 weeks and 4 days) would be Friday + 4 days = Tuesday. But that would be January 1, 2023. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the days. Let me check the actual day of the week for January 1, 2023. Wait, I can check online, but since I can't, I need to rely on my knowledge. Wait, I remember that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but if that's the case, then the answer would be Sunday. But according to the other calculation, adding 4 days to Friday would be Tuesday. So that's conflicting. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, maybe my breakdown of the days is wrong. Let me check again. Let's count the days from November 11, 2022 (Friday) to January 1, 2023. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nNovember 11 (Friday) + 1 day = November 12 (Saturday)\n+2 = November 13 (Sunday)\n+3 = November 14 (Monday)\n+4 = November 15 (Tuesday)\n+5 = November 16 (Wednesday)\n+6 = November 17 (Thursday)\n+7 = November 18 (Friday)\n+8 = November 19 (Saturday)\n+9 = November 20 (Sunday)\n+10 = November 21 (Monday)\n+11 = November 22 (Tuesday)\n+12 = November 23 (Wednesday)\n+13 = November 24 (Thursday)\n+14 = November 25 (Friday)\n+15 = November 26 (Saturday)\n+16 = November 27 (Sunday)\n+17 = November 28 (Monday)\n+18 = November 29 (Tuesday)\n+19 = November 30 (Wednesday) Wait, wait! Wait, November 11 is Friday. Adding 19 days would be November 30. But according to this count, November 11 + 19 days is November 30. But according to the day count, November 11 is Friday. Let's check the days:\n\nFrom November 11 to November 18 is 7 days (Friday to Friday). Then November 18 to November 25 is another 7 days (Friday to Friday). Then November 25 to November 30 is 5 days. So November 25 is Friday, then November 26 (Saturday), 27 (Sunday), 28 (Monday), 29 (Tuesday), 30 (Wednesday). So November 30 is Wednesday. But earlier I thought that November 30 was Friday. That's where the mistake was! Oh no, I had a mistake in the initial breakdown. So November 30 is Wednesday, not Friday. So that changes everything. So my previous calculation was wrong. So that's why there was a discrepancy.\n\nSo, if November 11 is Friday, then November 18 is Friday (7 days later), November 25 is Friday (another 7 days), then November 30 is 5 days after November 25. So November 25 is Friday, then November 26 (Saturday), 27 (Sunday), 28 (Monday), 29 (Tuesday), 30 (Wednesday). So November 30 is Wednesday. So that's 19 days from November 11. So that's correct. Then, adding 32 days to November 30 (Wednesday) would be 32 days later. Let's calculate that. 32 days is 4 weeks (28 days) and 4 days. So 28 days later is Wednesday again (since 28 is 4 weeks). Then adding 4 days: Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. So that would be Sunday. Which matches the initial calculation. So that's correct. So the answer is Sunday. \n\nSo the mistake was in the initial breakdown where I thought November 30 was Friday, but it's actually Wednesday. So that's why the two methods now agree. So the correct answer is Sunday. Therefore, the answer should be Sunday.\n</think>", "Sunday"], [99, "In a year where Sunday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 14. State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find out what day of the week March 14th is, given that January 1st is a Sunday. Hmm, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 14th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, I should break down the months. January has 31 days, right? So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February comes next. But wait, I need to consider whether it's a leap year or not. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the year, but since it's a general question, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Wait, but if the year is not a leap year, February has 28 days. However, if it's a leap year, February has 29. But the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. Hmm, maybe I need to check if the year is a leap year. Wait, but the problem says \"in a year where Sunday is January 1st\". So maybe the year is not a leap year? Or maybe it's possible that the year is a leap year, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps I should assume it's not a leap year. Wait, but how can I be sure? Maybe the problem is designed in a way that regardless of leap year, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me think. Let's check the number of days between January 1st and March 14th. If it's a non-leap year, then February has 28 days. So from January 1st to March 14th would be 31 (January) - 1 (since January 1st is day 0) + 28 (February) + 14 (March) days? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days between January 1st and March 14th is (31 - 1) days in January (since January 1st is day 0), then 28 days in February, then 14 days in March. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So to get the total days from January 1st to March 14th, it's (31 days in January) + (28 days in February) + 14 days in March? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on January 1st, then the next day is January 2nd, so the number of days between January 1st and March 14th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 14? Wait, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should calculate the total days from January 1st to March 14th inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, the problem is to find the weekday of March 14th, given that January 1st is a Sunday. So if January 1st is Sunday, then January 1st is day 0. Then, the next day, January 2nd is day 1 (Monday), and so on. So to find the day of the week for March 14th, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1st and March 14th, then take that number modulo 7. Because each 7 days cycle through the same weekday.\n\nSo let's calculate the total days from January 1st to March 14th. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year), so adding 28 days. Then March 14th is 14 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 30 (January) + 28 (February) + 14 (March) = 72 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is day 0, January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31. Then February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58 (since 28 days in February, so day 31 + 27 = 58). Then March 1st is day 59, March 14th is day 59 + 13 = day 72. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 72 days. Wait, but that's if we count the days from January 1st (inclusive) to March 14th (inclusive). Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then March 14th is 72 days after January 1st. So the number of days between January 1st and March 14th is 72 days. So then, since each week has 7 days, 72 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder will tell us the day of the week. So 72 divided by 7 is 10 weeks (70 days) with a remainder of 2 days. So 72 days later is 10 weeks and 2 days. So if January 1st is Sunday, then adding 72 days would be 2 days later. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is Sunday, then January 1st + 1 day is Monday (day 1), so adding 72 days would be 72 days later. So 72 days later is 72 mod 7 = 2. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Therefore, March 14th would be a Tuesday? But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of days from January 1st to March 14th. Let's do that again. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then January 31st is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days, so day 30 + 28 = day 58 (February 28th). Then March 1st is day 59, March 14th is day 59 + 13 = day 72. So yes, 72 days after January 1st. So 72 divided by 7 is 10*7=70, remainder 2. So 72 days later is 2 days after Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 is Tuesday. So March 14th is Tuesday. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check with another approach. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is Sunday. Let's count the days for each month. January has 31 days. So January 1st is Sunday. Then January 8th is Sunday again (7 days later). January 15th is Sunday, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Sunday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is Sunday. Then March 12th is Sunday. So March 12th is Sunday. Then March 13th is Monday, March 14th is Tuesday. So that's correct. So according to this, March 14th is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday. But wait, that's the same as the previous calculation. So that seems correct. But maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the number of days from January 1st to March 14th. Let's see, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 14th is 14 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 31 + 28 + 14 = 73 days? Wait, but that's if you count January 1st as day 1. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then the total days would be 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 14 (March) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if you have January 1st as day 0, then the number of days from January 1st to March 14th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 14 = 30 + 28 +14 = 72 days. Which matches the previous calculation. So 72 days. So 72 mod 7 is 2. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But wait, when I counted the Sundays, I found that March 12th is Sunday, so March 14th is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [99, "If a meeting is scheduled on the last Thursday of June 2022, on which day of the month does it occur? State the amount as a number.

Alternatively, I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up the calendar for June 2022. But since I can't actually look it up right now, I need to calculate it. Let me think. Let's start by knowing that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, I think January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me confirm. If that's the case, then I can count the days step by step.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the days of the week for June. Let's see, June has 30 days.

So the next Thursday after the 29th would be the 30th? Wait, no. Wait, if June 29 is a Thursday, then June 30 would be a Friday. So that would mean the last Thursday is the 29th. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. So maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me start over. Let's take June 1, 2022. If I can find out what day that was. Let me think. I know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then, let's count the days for each month. Let's see, January has 31 days.

January 3 is Monday. January 4 is Tuesday. So January 31 is a Tuesday (since 31 days later is 31 mod 7 = 3 days after January 1. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So February 1, 2022, is a Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 1 + 31 days is February 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday would be Tuesday. So February 1 is a Tuesday. Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, I can use the fact that June 1, 2022, was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If that's correct, then the first Thursday is June 2. Then the next ones would be 9, 16, 23, and 30. Wait, but June has 30 days. So June 30 would be a Thursday? Wait, if June 2 is Thursday, then adding 7 days each time. 2 +7=9, 16, 23, 30. So June 30 is a Thursday. But that would mean that the last Thursday is the 30th. But that would mean that June 30 is a Thursday. But if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 30 is 29 days later. 29 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 1 day. So Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday. So that's correct. So June 30 is a Thursday. Therefore, the last Thursday of June 2022 is the 30th. But wait, that seems conflicting with my previous thought where I thought that June 29 would be Thursday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nIf June 1 is Wednesday, then June 2 is Thursday. Then adding 7 days: 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th. So the 30th is a Thursday. So that's correct. Therefore, the last Thursday is the 30th. But wait, June has 30 days, so the 30th is the last day. So that would be the last Thursday. Therefore, the answer is 30. But wait, I need to make sure that June 1 is indeed a Wednesday. Because if that's wrong, then the entire calculation is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way.

If that's correct, then that would confirm that June 30 is a Thursday. But I need to verify if July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, I think that's correct. Because in 2022, July 1 was a Friday. So that would mean that June 30 was a Thursday. Therefore, the last Thursday is the 30th. Therefore, the answer is 30. But wait, the question says \"last Thursday of June 2022\". So if June 30 is a Thursday, then that's the last one. So the answer is 30. But I need to make sure that June 1 is a Wednesday. Let me think again. If July 1 is a Friday, then June 30 is a Thursday. So that's correct. Therefore, June 1 is a Wednesday. So the first Thursday is June 2, and the last is June 30. Therefore, the answer is 30. So the answer should be 30. But wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me check another way. Let's count the days from June 1 to June 30. If June 1 is Wednesday, then June 8 is Wednesday again. So June 8 is Wednesday. Then June 9 is Thursday. So that's the first Thursday. Then adding 7 days each time. So 9, 16, 23, 30. So yes, the 30th is a Thursday. Therefore, the answer is 30. So the answer is 30.

So if the first day is Sunday, the next day is Monday. So January 2nd would be Monday. Is there any chance that the question is a trick question? Like maybe considering some leap year or something? But the question doesn't mention anything about leap years. It just says \"a year where Sunday is January 1st.\" So regardless of whether it's a leap year or not, the days of the week just shift by one each year.

Let me start by recalling what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use some known dates. For example, I know that May 6, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, no, maybe that's not right.

Let me try to recall or calculate. Let me think of some known dates. For example, I remember that April 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if April 1 is a Friday, then April 8 is also a Friday, and so on. Then May 1 would be 30 days after April 1. Since April has 30 days, so 30 days later. Let me calculate the day of the week. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if April 1 is a Friday, then adding 2 days would make May 1 a Sunday. So May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. That seems right. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday. Wait, so May 5 is a Thursday. Then the next Thursday would be May 12, 19, 26. Then the last Thursday in May would be May 26. Wait, but May has 31 days. So May 26 is a Thursday, then May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday.

So May 6 is Friday. Then May 5 is Thursday. So that would mean that May 5 is Thursday. Then the next Thursday is May 12, 19, 26. So May 26 is the last Thursday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 26. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me check an online calendar or use another method. Alternatively, I can use the fact that May 2022 has 31 days. If May 5 is Thursday, then adding 28 days (4 weeks) would be May 26, which is also a Thursday. Then May 26 is the last Thursday. So yes, that's correct.

Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2098. First, divide 2098 by 4. Let's do the division. 4 times 524 is 2096, so 2098 minus 2096 is 2. That means 2098 divided by 4 is 524.5. Since there's a remainder, 2098 is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check again. Let me add 4 to 2096, which is 2100. So 2098 is two years before 2100. So 2098 divided by 4 is 524.5, which is not an integer. Therefore, 2098 is not divisible by 4. \n\nSince it's not divisible by 4, regardless of whether it's a century year or not, it can't be a leap year. But wait, is 2098 a century year? Century years are those divisible by 100. 2098 divided by 100 is 20.98, so no. So it's not a century year. Therefore, the first condition (divisible by 4) isn't met, so it's not a leap year. \n\nSo the answer should be No.\n</think>", "No"], [99, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, February 6 to Friday, March 4, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays directly. But maybe the first approach is better.\n\nWait, but how do I find the total days? Let me check the dates. Let's start by checking the dates. February 6, 2022 is a Sunday. Then March 4 is a Friday. Let me check how many days are in between.\n\nFirst, let's check how many days are in February 2022. Since 2022 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. So from February 6 to February 28 inclusive, how many days? Let's calculate that. February 6 to February 28 is 28 - 6 + 1 = 23 days. Wait, because if you include both start and end dates, it's (end - start) + 1. So 28 - 6 = 22, plus 1 is 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total days from February 6 to March 4 inclusive is 23 + 4 = 27 days. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nFebruary 6 is day 1. Then February 7 is day 2, and so on. February 28 is day 23 (since 28-6=22, plus 1 is 23). Then March 1 is day 24, March 2 is 25, March 3 is 26, March 4 is 27. So total 27 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 27 days.\n\nNow, out of these 27 days, how many are weekends? Let's see. The start date is Sunday, February 6. So that's a Sunday. Then the next day, February 7 is Monday. Then the next day, February 8 is Tuesday, and so on. So the weekends in this period would be Sundays and Saturdays. Let's list them.\n\nFirst, February 6 is Sunday. Then the next Sunday would be February 13, 20, and March 5. Wait, but March 5 is beyond the end date of March 4. So in the period from February 6 to March 4, the Sundays are February 6, 13, 20. Then March 4 is a Friday, so March 5 is a Saturday, but that's outside the range. So the Sundays in the period are three days: 6, 13, 20. Then Saturdays would be February 5 (but that's before the start date), February 12, 19, and March 4 is Friday. Wait, wait. Wait, the start date is February 6, so the first Saturday after that would be February 12 (since February 6 is Sunday, 7 is Monday, 8 Tuesday, 9 Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday). Then next Saturday is 19, then 26. Then March 4 is Friday, so March 5 is Saturday, but that's after March 4. So the Saturdays in the period are February 12, 19, 26. So that's three Saturdays. So total weekends are 3 Sundays + 3 Saturdays = 6 days. Therefore, the number of weekdays would be total days (27) minus weekends (6) = 21 weekdays. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me list all the days from February 6 to March 4 and count the weekends. Let's start:\n\nFebruary 6: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 7: Monday (weekday)\nFebruary 8: Tuesday (weekday)\nFebruary 9: Wednesday (weekday)\nFebruary 10: Thursday (weekday)\nFebruary 11: Friday (weekday)\nFebruary 12: Saturday (weekend)\nFebruary 13: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 14: Monday (weekday)\nFebruary 15: Tuesday (weekday)\nFebruary 16: Wednesday (weekday)\nFebruary 17: Thursday (weekday)\nFebruary 18: Friday (weekday)\nFebruary 19: Saturday (weekend)\nFebruary 20: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 21: Monday (weekday)\nFebruary 22: Tuesday (weekday)\nFebruary 23: Wednesday (weekday)\nFebruary 24: Thursday (weekday)\nFebruary 25: Friday (weekday)\nFebruary 26: Saturday (weekend)\nFebruary 27: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 28: Monday (weekday)\nMarch 1: Tuesday (weekday)\nMarch 2: Wednesday (weekday)\nMarch 3: Thursday (weekday)\nMarch 4: Friday (weekend)\n\nWait, wait, March 4 is Friday. Wait, but according to the initial problem statement, the end date is Friday, March 4. So March 4 is included. But in the above list, March 4 is Friday. So in the list above, the weekends are:\n\nFebruary 6 (Sunday), 12 (Saturday), 13 (Sunday), 19 (Saturday), 20 (Sunday), 26 (Saturday), 27 (Sunday). Wait, but March 4 is Friday, so the next day is March 5, which is Saturday. So in the period from February 6 to March 4, the Sundays are 6, 13, 20, 27. Wait, but March 4 is Friday. So March 27 is after March 4. Wait, March 4 is the end date. So March 27 is not in the period. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount the days properly.\n\nWait, the period is from February 6 (Sunday) to March 4 (Friday). Let me list each day step by step, starting from February 6:\n\nFebruary 6: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 7: Monday\nFebruary 8: Tuesday\nFebruary 9: Wednesday\nFebruary 10: Thursday\nFebruary 11: Friday\nFebruary 12: Saturday (weekend)\nFebruary 13: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 14: Monday\nFebruary 15: Tuesday\nFebruary 16: Wednesday\nFebruary 17: Thursday\nFebruary 18: Friday\nFebruary 19: Saturday (weekend)\nFebruary 20: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 21: Monday\nFebruary 22: Tuesday\nFebruary 23: Wednesday\nFebruary 24: Thursday\nFebruary 25: Friday\nFebruary 26: Saturday (weekend)\nFebruary 27: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 28: Monday\nMarch 1: Tuesday\nMarch 2: Wednesday\nMarch 3: Thursday\nMarch 4: Friday\n\nSo that's 27 days total. Now, let's count the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays):\n\nSundays: February 6, 13, 20, 27. Wait, but February 27 is a Sunday? Let me check. Let's see, February 6 is Sunday. Then February 13 is 7 days later, which is also Sunday. Then 20, 27. Then March 6 would be next Sunday. But March 4 is Friday. So February 27 is Sunday. But March 4 is Friday. So in the period up to March 4, the Sundays are 6, 13, 20, 27. Wait, but February 27 is within the period (since the end date is March 4). So that's four Sundays. Then Saturdays: February 12, 19, 26. That's three Saturdays. So total weekends are 4 + 3 = 7 days. Therefore, the number of weekdays would be 27 - 7 = 20. But wait, earlier I thought 6, but now I'm getting 7. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the days again. Let's list all the days and mark weekends:\n\n1. Feb 6: Sun (weekend)\n2. Feb 7: Mon\n3. Feb 8: Tue\n4. Feb 9: Wed\n5. Feb 10: Thu\n6. Feb 11: Fri\n7. Feb 12: Sat (weekend)\n8. Feb 13: Sun (weekend)\n9. Feb 14: Mon\n10. Feb 15: Tue\n11. Feb 16: Wed\n12. Feb 17: Thu\n13. Feb 18: Fri\n14. Feb 19: Sat (weekend)\n15. Feb 20: Sun (weekend)\n16. Feb 21: Mon\n17. Feb 22: Tue\n18. Feb 23: Wed\n19. Feb 24: Thu\n20. Feb 25: Fri\n21. Feb 26: Sat (weekend)\n22. Feb 27: Sun (weekend)\n23. Feb 28: Mon\n24. Mar 1: Tue\n25. Mar 2: Wed\n26. Mar 3: Thu\n27. Mar 4: Fri\n\nSo weekends are days 1,7,8,14,15,21,22. That's 7 days. So 7 weekends. Therefore, 27 total days minus 7 weekends equals 20 weekdays. But wait, the start date is Sunday (Feb 6) which is a weekend, and the end date is Friday (Mar 4) which is a weekday. So the count should be 20 weekdays. But earlier when I thought of Sundays as 3 and Saturdays as 3, that was wrong. Because there are 4 Sundays (Feb 6,13,20,27) and 3 Saturdays (12,19,26). So 4+3=7. So 27-7=20. Therefore, the answer is 20?\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me count the number of weekdays. Let's go through each day:\n\nWeekdays are Mon-Fri. So:\n\nDay 2: Mon (1)\nDay 3: Tue (2)\nDay 4: Wed (3)\nDay 5: Thu (4)\nDay 6: Fri (5)\nDay 9: Mon (6)\nDay 10: Tue (7)\nDay 11: Wed (8)\nDay 12: Thu (9)\nDay 13: Fri (10)\nDay 16: Mon (11)\nDay 17: Tue (12)\nDay 18: Wed (13)\nDay 19: Thu (14)\nDay 20: Fri (15)\nDay 23: Mon (16)\nDay 24: Tue (17)\nDay 25: Wed (18)\nDay 26: Thu (19)\nDay 27: Fri (20)\n\nWait, that's 20 weekdays. So that's correct. So the answer is 20. But why did I think earlier that the total days were 27? Let me check again. The total days from Feb 6 to March 4 inclusive is 27 days. So 27 days total. 7 weekends, 20 weekdays. So the answer is 20. But I need to make sure that the dates are correct. Let me check the actual dates. \n\nWait, February 6, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me check that. Let me check an online calendar or use a date calculator. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. For example, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday. Then January 3 is Monday. So February 6, 2022: Let's count the days. January has 31 days. So from January 1 (Saturday) to January 31 is 31 days. So February 1 is 31 days after January 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 1 is Saturday, so January 31 is Tuesday (since 31 days later is 4 weeks and 3 days, so Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday). Therefore, February 1 is Wednesday. Then February 6 is 5 days later. Wednesday + 5 days is Monday. Wait, that contradicts the initial assumption that February 6 is Sunday. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday. Then January 3 is Monday. January 4 is Tuesday. January 5 is Wednesday. January 6 is Thursday. January 7 is Friday. January 8 is Saturday. January 9 is Sunday. January 10 is Monday. January 11 is Tuesday. January 12 is Wednesday. January 13 is Thursday. January 14 is Friday. January 15 is Saturday. January 16 is Sunday. January 17 is Monday. January 18 is Tuesday. January 19 is Wednesday. January 20 is Thursday. January 21 is Friday. January 22 is Saturday. January 23 is Sunday. January 24 is Monday. January 25 is Tuesday. January 26 is Wednesday. January 27 is Thursday. January 28 is Friday. January 29 is Saturday. January 30 is Sunday. January 31 is Monday. Wait, that's 31 days. So January 31 is Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. So if January 1 is Saturday, then January 31 is Monday. Therefore, February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 6 is 5 days later. So Tuesday + 5 days is Sunday. Wait, Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Saturday (5), Sunday (6). So February 6 is Sunday. That matches the initial problem statement. So that's correct. So my initial assumption was correct. So February 6 is Sunday. Then the days I listed earlier are correct. Therefore, the count of 20 weekdays is correct. Therefore, the answer is 20.\n</think>", "20"], [99, "Between Sunday, June 12, 2022 and Thursday, July 28, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Monday occur?

So first, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those days are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates and count the Mondays. But since the dates are spread over two months, maybe I should check the days of the week for each month. Let me start by checking what day June 12, 2022 was. The problem says it's a Sunday. So June 12 is a Sunday. Then June 13 would be a Monday. So that's the first Monday in the range. Then I need to count all the Mondays from June 13 up to July 28, inclusive.\n\nBut wait, July 28 is a Thursday. So the last day of the period is Thursday. So the last Monday would be July 25, 2022, because July 25 is a Monday, and then July 26 is Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday. So that's the last Monday in the range.\n\nSo now I need to count how many Mondays are between June 13 and July 25, inclusive. Let me figure out how many weeks there are in that period and then add any extra days.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days between June 12 and July 28. Since June 12 is the first day, and July 28 is the last day. Let me calculate the number of days in June after June 12, then add the days in July up to July 28.\n\nJune has 30 days. So from June 12 to June 30 inclusive is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Wait, wait. Wait, June 12 is day 1. Then June 13 is day 2, etc. Wait, but if I want the number of days from June 12 to June 30 inclusive, that's 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total days from June 12 to July 28 inclusive is 19 + 28 = 47 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Because June 12 is day 1, then adding 19 days would take me to June 30. Then adding 28 days in July would take me to July 28. So total days is 19 + 28 = 47 days. So 47 days in total.\n\nNow, since the first day is Sunday (June 12), then the next day is Monday (June 13). So the first Monday is day 2. Then each week has 7 days. So the number of Mondays would be the total number of days divided by 7, rounded up or down depending on the remainder. Wait, but since the first day is Sunday, the first Monday is day 2. So the Mondays would be on days 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51... but wait, the total days are 47. So the last day is day 47. So let's see, how many Mondays are there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the extra days. Since 47 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 5 days. Because 6*7=42, 47-42=5. So 6 weeks would have 6 Mondays. Then the remaining 5 days would be days 43 to 47. Let's check what day of the week those are. Since day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, day 3 Tuesday, day 4 Wednesday, day 5 Thursday, day 6 Friday, day 7 Saturday. Then day 8 is Sunday again. So day 43 would be day 43. Let's calculate 43 divided by 7. 7*6=42, so day 43 is day 1 of the next week, which is Sunday. Then day 43 is Sunday, 44 Monday, 45 Tuesday, 46 Wednesday, 47 Thursday. So the extra 5 days include one Monday (day 44). So total Mondays would be 6 + 1 = 7. But wait, that would be 7 Mondays. But wait, let me check again. Because the first Monday is day 2, then adding 7 days each time. So the Mondays would be on days 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44. That's 7 Mondays. Then day 44 is the 7th Monday. Then day 44 +7 = 51, which is beyond 47. So yes, 7 Mondays. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Let me count the actual dates.\n\nJune 13 (Monday) is the first. Then June 20, 27. Then July 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 7 Mondays. So that's correct. So the answer is 7. But wait, let me check if July 25 is within the period. The period ends on July 28. So July 25 is included.

But how many business days?\n\nMarch 1 (Tue) to March 22 (Tue). Let's see. Let's break it down. March has 31 days, but we only need up to the 22nd. So from March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. Let's check how many weekends are in that period. Let's list the days:\n\nMarch 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue).\n\nSo the weekends in this period are March 5,6; 12,13; 19,20. That's 6 weekend days. So total days in March is 22. Subtract 6 weekends, so 22 - 6 = 16 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From March 1 to March 22 inclusive is 22 days. Let's count the number of weekends. Each week has two weekends. Let's see how many weeks are in 22 days. 22 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 1 day. So 3 weeks is 21 days. So the first 21 days would have 3*2=6 weekend days. Then the 22nd day is a Tuesday, which is a business day. So total weekends are 6. So 22-6=16 business days. That's correct.\n\nSo adding up the business days:\n\nJanuary: 6\n\nFebruary: 20\n\nMarch: 16\n\nTotal is 6 + 20 + 16 = 42.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the January count. Let me recheck January.\n\nJanuary 24 (Mon) to January 31 (Mon). That's 8 days. The weekends are 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun). So 2 days. So 8-2=6. Correct.\n\nFebruary is 28 days, 4 weeks, 20 business days. Correct.\n\nMarch 1 to March 22 is 22 days. 6 weekends. 22-6=16. Correct.\n\nTotal 6+20+16=42. So the answer is 42?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check using another method. Let's calculate the total days between the two dates, then subtract the weekends.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days from Jan 24 to March 22 inclusive.\n\nLet me calculate the days in each month.\n\nJanuary: 31 days. From Jan 24 to Jan 31 is 8 days (including both ends).\n\nFebruary: 28 days.\n\nMarch: 22 days.\n\nTotal days: 8 + 28 + 22 = 58 days.\n\nNow, total days is 58. Now, how many weekends are in these 58 days?\n\nBut how to calculate that. Let's see. The first day is Monday, Jan 24. The last day is Tuesday, March 22.\n\nSo the total days is 58. Let's find the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period.\n\nSince the first day is Monday, the first weekend is Jan 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun). Then next weekends are Feb 5-6, 12-13, 19-20, March 5-6, 12-13, 19-20, 26-27. Wait, but March 22 is the end date. So March 26 and 27 would be beyond the end date.\n\nSo let's count the number of weekends.\n\nFirst, let's list all the weekends in the period.\n\nJanuary: 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun) \u2192 2 days.\n\nFebruary: 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Wait, February has 28 days. So 26 and 27 are in February. So that's 4 weekends in February? Wait, 5,6; 12,13; 19,20; 26,27. That's 4 weekends. So 4*2=8 days.\n\nMarch: 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). But the end date is March 22. So March 26 and 27 are beyond. So in March, the weekends are 5,6,12,13,19,20. That's 3 weekends. So 3*2=6 days.\n\nSo total weekends: 2 (Jan) + 8 (Feb) + 6 (Mar) = 16 days.\n\nSo total days is 58. Subtract 16 weekends: 58 - 16 = 42. So that's the same as before. So the answer is 42.\n\nTherefore, the number of business days is 42.\n</think>", "42"], [99, "Count forward 99 days from Monday, December 26, 2022 - what's the weekday? Give the weekday name in full.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week it will be 99 days after Monday, December 26, 2022. Let me start by breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I know that December 26, 2022 is a Monday. The question is asking for the weekday 99 days later. To find the weekday, I can use the fact that each week has 7 days. So, if I divide 99 by 7, the remainder will tell me how many days ahead I need to count from Monday.\n\nLet me do the division: 99 divided by 7. 7 times 14 is 98, so 99 divided by 7 is 14 weeks with a remainder of 1 day. Because 14 weeks is exactly 98 days, so 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. That means 99 days from Monday would be 1 day after Monday. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again. If I start on Monday, adding 1 day would be Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should verify this with another method to be sure. Sometimes when counting days, it's easy to make a mistake with the remainder.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as starting from Monday, December 26, 2022. Let's count the days step by step. But that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Since 99 mod 7 is 1, because 7*14=98, 99-98=1. So the remainder is 1. So adding 1 day to Monday would be Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the days? Wait, December 26, 2022 is in 2022, which is not a leap year. So February has 28 days. But since we're starting in December, the next year is 2023, which is also not a leap year. So the number of days in each month would be standard. But does that affect the calculation? Well, the problem is that when you count days forward, the actual dates might cross into different months and years, but since we're just looking for the weekday, the number of days in each month doesn't affect the weekday calculation. Because the key is the remainder when divided by 7. So even if there are 31 days in a month, as long as the total days are 99, the remainder is 1. So adding 1 day to Monday would be Tuesday. \n\nBut maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's think about specific dates. For example, 7 days after Monday is the next Monday. So 14 days later is also a Monday. Then 14*7=98 days later is also a Monday. So 98 days after December 26, 2022 is Monday, December 26, 2023? Wait, wait, no. Wait, December 26, 2022 plus 98 days would be December 26, 2022 plus 14 weeks. So that's exactly 14 weeks later, which is the same day of the week. So 98 days later is Monday, December 26, 2023? Wait, but December 26, 2022 plus 98 days would be... Let me check. December has 31 days. So December 26 plus 5 days is December 31, 2022. Then 98 days is 5 days in December, then 31 days in January (2023), 28 days in February (2023), 31 days in March, etc. Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. But if 98 days is exactly 14 weeks, then the day of the week should be the same. So 98 days later is Monday. Then 99 days later is 1 day after that, which is Tuesday. So that seems to confirm the previous answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check an online calendar or use a known date. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on calculations. Another way: Let's count the days step by step. Let's take December 26, 2022 as day 0 (Monday). Then day 1 is December 27, 2022 (Tuesday). Day 7 is January 2, 2023 (Monday). Then day 14 is January 9, 2023 (Monday). So each 7 days, it's the same day. So day 98 would be 14 weeks later, which is Monday, January 9, 2023? Wait, no. Wait, December 26 plus 7 days is January 2, 2023. Then adding 7 days again is January 9, 2023. Then adding 7 days is January 16, 2023.

Express your answer as a number.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between Thursday, September 15 and Saturday, November 26, 2022, inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, right? So weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days and then subtract the weekends. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down month by month. Let's check each month from September to November 2022.\n\nStarting with September. The start date is September 15, which is a Thursday. Let me check what day of the week each date is. Wait, maybe I need to know the days in each month. September has 30 days. October has 31, November has 30.\n\nSo from September 15 to September 30: that's 16 days (including both start and end). Wait, September 15 is day 1, then September 16 is day 2, etc. So from 15th to 30th inclusive, that's 30 - 15 + 1 = 16 days. But how many of those are weekdays?\n\nSeptember 15 is Thursday. Let's list the days:\n\nSeptember 15: Thursday (count as weekday)\n16: Friday (weekday)\n17: Saturday (weekend)\n18: Sunday (weekend)\n19: Monday (weekday)\n20: Tuesday (weekday)\n21: Wednesday (weekday)\n22: Thursday (weekday)\n23: Friday (weekday)\n24: Saturday (weekend)\n25: Sunday (weekend)\n26: Monday (weekday)\n27: Tuesday (weekday)\n28: Wednesday (weekday)\n29: Thursday (weekday)\n30: Friday (weekday)\n\nSo from September 15 to 30, how many weekdays? Let's count:\n\nThursday (15), Friday (16), Monday (19), Tuesday (20), Wednesday (21), Thursday (22), Friday (23), Monday (26), Tuesday (27), Wednesday (28), Thursday (29), Friday (30). That's 12 weekdays. Wait, let me check again. Wait, September 15 is Thursday. Then 15,16 are weekdays. Then 17-18 weekend. 19-21: 3 weekdays. 22-23: 2 weekdays. 24-25: weekend. 26-30: 5 weekdays (26,27,28,29,30). So total is 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 12? Wait, 2 (15-16) + 3 (19-21) + 2 (22-23) + 5 (26-30) = 12. Yes. So September has 12 weekdays.\n\nNow October. October has 31 days. Let's check the days. But first, what day is October 1, 2022? Let me think. September 15 is Thursday. September has 30 days, so September 30 is a Friday. Then October 1 is Saturday. Wait, because September 30 is Friday, so October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is a Saturday. So the first day of October is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday, etc.\n\nSo October has 31 days. Let's count the weekdays in October. Since October 1 is Saturday, the first week of October has 2 weekend days (Sat and Sun), then the rest of the days. Let's see. The number of weeks in October is 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, plus 3 days. So the first 28 days are 4 weeks, which would have 4*5=20 weekdays (since each week has 5 weekdays). Then the remaining 3 days are October 29, 30, 31. Let's check what days those are. October 1 is Saturday, so October 29 is Saturday (since 28 days later is October 28, which is a Friday, then 29 is Saturday, 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday. Wait, no. Wait, October 1 is Saturday. So October 1: Sat, 2: Sun, 3: Mon, 4: Tue, 5: Wed, 6: Thu, 7: Fri, 8: Sat, etc. So each week cycles. So October 29 is 28 days after October 1, which is October 29. Wait, 28 days is exactly 4 weeks. So October 29 is Saturday (same as October 1). Then October 30 is Sunday, October 31 is Monday. So the remaining 3 days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So in those 3 days, the weekdays are Monday (31st). So that's 1 weekday. So total weekdays in October would be 20 (from the 4 weeks) + 1 (from the extra days) = 21? Wait, but wait, the first 28 days of October include 4 weeks. But the first day of October is Saturday, so the first week (days 1-7) has 2 weekend days (Sat and Sun) and 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri). Wait, but the first week of October is days 1-7: Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri. So that's 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri) and 2 weekends. So each week has 5 weekdays. So 4 weeks would be 4*5=20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days (29,30,31) are Sat, Sun, Mon. So only Monday is a weekday. So total 21 weekdays in October. So October has 21 weekdays.\n\nNow November. November 1, 2022. Let's check what day that is. October has 31 days. October 31 is Monday. So November 1 is Tuesday. So November 1 is Tuesday. The end date is November 26. So November has 30 days. Let's count the weekdays from November 1 to November 26 inclusive.\n\nNovember 1 is Tuesday. Let's see how many days that is. From November 1 to November 26 is 26 days. Let's check how many weeks and days that is. 26 days is 3 weeks and 5 days. So 3 weeks is 21 days, plus 5 days. So the first 21 days (Nov 1-21) would be 3 weeks, which is 3*5=15 weekdays. Then the remaining 5 days are Nov 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Let's check what days those are. November 1 is Tuesday. So November 22 is Tuesday (since 21 days later is Nov 22, which is same day of week as Nov 1). Then Nov 22 is Tuesday, 23 is Wednesday, 24 is Thursday, 25 is Friday, 26 is Saturday. So the remaining 5 days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So the weekdays here are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. That's 4 weekdays. So total weekdays in November would be 15 + 4 = 19. Wait, but wait, the end date is November 26, which is Saturday. So the 26th is included. So the 5 days from 22-26: 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat). So the weekdays are 22-25, which is 4 days. So total 15 +4=19. So November has 19 weekdays.\n\nSo total weekdays from September 15 to November 26 would be September's 12 + October's 21 + November's 19. Let's add them up: 12 +21 is 33, plus 19 is 52. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me check again.\n\nWait, but wait, the start date is September 15 (Thursday) and end date is November 26 (Saturday). So the total days in September are 16 days (from 15 to 30). Then October is 31 days, November is 26 days (from 1 to 26). Wait, but when adding the weekdays, I considered September's 12, October's 21, November's 19. So 12+21+19=52. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekdays in each month. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, September: 12 weekdays. Let me recount. From September 15 (Thu) to September 30 (Fri). Let's list each day:\n\n15: Thu (weekday)\n16: Fri (weekday)\n17: Sat (weekend)\n18: Sun (weekend)\n19: Mon (weekday)\n20: Tue (weekday)\n21: Wed (weekday)\n22: Thu (weekday)\n23: Fri (weekday)\n24: Sat (weekend)\n25: Sun (weekend)\n26: Mon (weekday)\n27: Tue (weekday)\n28: Wed (weekday)\n29: Thu (weekday)\n30: Fri (weekday)\n\nSo that's 15,16,19,20,21,22,23,26,27,28,29,30. That's 12 days. Correct.\n\nOctober: 21 weekdays. Let me check. October 1 is Saturday. So the first week (days 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri). Then days 8-14: same, 5 weekdays. Days 15-21: same, 5 weekdays. Then days 22-28: same, 5 weekdays. Then days 29-31: 3 days. So 4 weeks (28 days) would be 4*5=20. Then the remaining 3 days (29,30,31) are Sat, Sun, Mon. So only Monday is a weekday. So 20+1=21. Correct.\n\nNovember: 19 weekdays. November 1 is Tuesday. So days 1-7: Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon. So weekdays are Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon. That's 5 weekdays. Then days 8-14: same as before, 5 weekdays. Days 15-21: 5 weekdays. Days 22-28: 5 weekdays. Then days 29-31: 3 days. But we only need up to November 26. So from November 1 to 26 is 26 days. Let's see, 26 days is 3 weeks (21 days) plus 5 days. So 3*5=15 weekdays. Then the remaining 5 days (22-26) are Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat. So 4 weekdays. So 15+4=19. Correct.\n\nSo total is 12+21+19=52. But wait, let me check if there's any overlap or mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days between the two dates and subtract the weekends. Let's try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of days from September 15 to November 26 inclusive. Let's compute that.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. From September 15 to September 30 is 16 days (as before). October has 31 days. November has 26 days. So total days is 16 + 31 + 26 = 73 days. Wait, 16+31 is 47, plus 26 is 73. So total 73 days.\n\nNow, the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in these 73 days. Then subtract that from 73 to get the number of weekdays.\n\nBut how many weekends are there?\n\nAlternatively, since we know the total days, and the number of weekdays is 52, then the weekends would be 73-52=21. Let me check if that's correct. But maybe I can calculate the weekends directly.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to check with the previous calculation. If the total days are 73, and the answer is 52 weekdays, then that would mean 21 weekends. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the number of weekends in each month.\n\nSeptember: from 15th to 30th. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nSeptember 15 is Thursday. So the first weekend in September is 17 (Sat) and 18 (Sun). Then next weekend is 24 (Sat) and 25 (Sun). Then next is 31 (Sat) but September only has 30 days. So in September, there are two weekends: 17-18 and 24-25. That's 4 days. So 4 weekend days.\n\nOctober: October has 31 days. October 1 is Saturday. So the first weekend is 1 (Sat) and 2 (Sun). Then 8-9, 15-16, 22-23, 29-30. So that's 5 weekends. Each weekend is 2 days, so 5*2=10 days. But wait, October has 31 days. Let me check. The first weekend is 1-2, then 8-9, 15-16, 22-23, 29-30. That's 5 weekends. Then October 31 is Monday. So total 5*2=10 weekend days.\n\nNovember: November 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend in November is 7 (Sat) and 8 (Sun). Then 14-15, 21-22, 28-29. Then November 30 is a Wednesday. So the weekends in November are 7-8, 14-15, 21-22, 28-29. That's 4 weekends. So 4*2=8 days. But the end date is November 26. So November 26 is Saturday. So in November, the weekends up to 26th would be 7-8, 14-15, 21-22, 28-29. But November 28 is a Saturday, and 29 is Sunday. But November 26 is Saturday. So the last weekend in November is 28-29, but since the end date is 26, which is Saturday, that weekend is only partially included. Wait, November 26 is Saturday. So the weekends in November up to 26th would be:\n\nFirst weekend: 7-8 (both in November)\nSecond: 14-15\nThird: 21-22\nFourth: 28-29. But November 28 is Saturday, 29 is Sunday. However, the end date is November 26, which is Saturday. So the 28-29 weekend is not included. So in November, the weekends up to 26th are 7-8, 14-15, 21-22. That's 3 weekends, 3*2=6 days. Wait, but November 26 is Saturday. So the weekend of 28-29 is not included. So in November, the number of weekend days is 6. So total weekends in the entire period would be September's 4 + October's 10 + November's 6 = 20. So total weekends is 20. Then total days is 73, so weekdays would be 73-20=53. Wait, but earlier calculation was 52. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So according to the first method, the answer is 52, but according to the second method, it's 53. So I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nLet me check again. Let's recalculate the weekends in each month.\n\nFirst, September: from 15th to 30th. The weekends are 17-18 (Sat, Sun), 24-25 (Sat, Sun). That's 4 days. Correct.\n\nOctober: 31 days. The weekends are 1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23, 29-30. That's 5 weekends, 10 days. Correct.\n\nNovember: from 1st to 26th. The weekends are 7-8, 14-15, 21-22. That's 3 weekends, 6 days. But wait, November 26 is Saturday. So the next weekend is 28-29, but that's after the end date. So November has 6 weekend days. So total weekends: 4+10+6=20. So total days 73, so 73-20=53 weekdays. But according to the first method, it was 52. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first method. Let me check the first method again.\n\nIn September, 12 weekdays. October 21,"], [99, "Is 2055 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2055 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2055. First, divide 2055 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2055 minus 2000 is 55. 55 divided by 4 is 13.75. So 2055 divided by 4 is 513.75. That means it's not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check more carefully. 4 times 513 is 2052. Then 2055 minus 2052 is 3. So yes, there's a remainder of 3. Therefore, 2055 is not divisible by 4. \n\nSince it's not divisible by 4, regardless of whether it's a century year or not, it can't be a leap year. So the answer should be No. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the division. Let me try another way. 2055 divided by 4. Let's see, 4 times 500 is 2000, as before. 2055 minus 2000 is 55. 55 divided by 4 is 13 with a remainder of 3. So total remainder is 3. So yes, definitely not divisible by 4. Therefore, 2055 is not a leap year. \n\nAnother check: maybe I can use another method. For example, 2055 divided by 4. Let's do the division step by step. 4 into 20 is 5, 5 times 4 is 20. Bring down the 5. 4 into 5 is 1, 1 times 4 is 4. Subtract, get 1. Bring down the 5, making 15. 4 into 15 is 3, 3 times 4 is 12. Subtract, get 3. So the remainder is 3. So yes, same result. So definitely not divisible by 4. \n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n</think>", "No"], [99, "Count forward 46 days from Wednesday, February 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it will be 46 days after Wednesday, February 2, 2022. Hmm, so first, I should probably figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 46 days because weeks cycle every 7 days. \n\nSo, 46 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 6 is 42, which leaves a remainder of 4. So 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days. Since 6 weeks later would be the same day of the week, adding 4 days to Wednesday should give me the answer. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. If I start on Wednesday, adding 1 day would be Thursday, 2 days Friday, 3 days Saturday, 4 days Sunday. So adding 4 days to Wednesday would be Sunday. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count each day step by step to confirm. Let's start from February 2, 2022, which is a Wednesday. Let's count 46 days forward. But maybe I should check if February 2022 has 28 or 29 days. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, right? Because leap years are divisible by 4, but 2020 was a leap year, 2024 will be. So 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. \n\nSo starting from February 2, adding 28 days would take me to February 28, which is 28 days later. Since 28 is exactly 4 weeks, that would be the same day, Wednesday again. Then, adding another 18 days (since 28 + 18 = 46). Wait, no, 28 days later is February 28. Then adding 18 more days. Wait, but 46 days total. Wait, 46 minus 28 is 18. So from February 28, adding 18 days. Let me check that. \n\nBut maybe breaking it down into months would help. Let's see. February 2 is Wednesday. Let's count the days in February. February has 28 days, so February 2 + 28 days is February 28. Then March has 31 days, April has 30, May 31, etc. But maybe I don't need to go that far. Wait, 46 days from February 2. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Since 46 divided by 7 gives a remainder of 4, as I thought before. So adding 4 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 Friday, +3 Saturday, +4 Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with an actual calendar or a different method. Let me try another approach. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nStarting from February 2, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count 46 days. \n\nFirst, let's count the days in February. From February 2 to February 28 is 27 days (since 28 - 2 = 26 days, plus the starting day). Wait, no. If I start on February 2, then February 3 is +1 day, so February 2 + 28 days would be February 28. So that's 28 days. So 28 days later is February 28, which is Wednesday again. Then, adding 18 more days (since 28 + 18 = 46). \n\nNow, March has 31 days. So adding 18 days to February 28. Let's see. March 1 is Thursday. Then March 1 is day 29 (since 28 days later is March 1). Wait, no. Wait, February 28 is day 28. Then March 1 is day 29. So adding 18 days to February 28 would be March 1 + 17 days. Wait, maybe I should count step by step. \n\nFrom February 28 (Wednesday), adding 1 day is March 1 (Thursday). Then March 2 is Friday, March 3 Saturday, March 4 Sunday, March 5 Monday, March 6 Tuesday, March 7 Wednesday. That's 7 days. So adding 7 days brings us back to Wednesday. Then adding another 7 days would be March 14 (Wednesday again). Then March 21 (Wednesday), March 28 (Wednesday). Wait, but we need to add 18 days. Let me see. \n\nWait, from February 28 (Wednesday), adding 18 days. Let's break it down. 18 days is 2 weeks (14 days) and 4 days. So 14 days later is March 14 (Wednesday). Then adding 4 more days: March 15 (Thursday), 16 (Friday), 17 (Saturday), 18 (Sunday). So March 18 is Sunday. Therefore, 46 days after February 2 is March 18, 2022, which is a Sunday. \n\nSo that matches the earlier calculation. So the answer should be Sunday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. Let me check the actual date. Wait, I can't access the internet, but maybe I can recall that February 2, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me check if I can confirm that. Wait, I think that's correct. For example, February 1, 2022 was Tuesday, so February 2 is Wednesday. \n\nSo adding 46 days. Let me check another way. Let's count the number of days in each month. From February 2 to March 18. Let's see. From February 2 to February 28 is 27 days (since 28 - 2 = 26 days, plus the starting day). Wait, no. Wait, if I start on February 2, then February 2 is day 0. Then February 3 is day 1, and so on. So from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days later. Then adding March 1 to March 18 is 18 days. So total 26 + 18 = 44 days. Wait, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the days from February 2 to February 28. Let's see, February 2 is day 0. Then February 3 is +1, ..., February 28 is 26 days later. So 26 days. Then March 1 is day 27. Then March 2 is 28, ..., March 18 is 27 + 17 = 44 days. Wait, but that's only 44 days. But we need 46 days. So that's 44 days from February 2 to March 18. Then adding 2 more days would be March 20. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If February 2 is day 0, then February 28 is 26 days later. Then March 1 is day 27. March 18 is 17 days after March 1 (since March 1 is day 27, March 2 is 28, ..., March 18 is 27 + 17 = 44 days. So that's 44 days from February 2. Then adding 2 more days would be March 20 (day 46). So March 20 would be 46 days after February 2. \n\nBut earlier, when I broke it down into 28 days (February 28) and then 18 days, I thought that March 18 was 46 days. But that seems conflicting. So which is correct? \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first breakdown. Let me check again. \n\nIf February 2 is day 0, then adding 28 days would be February 28 (day 28). Then adding 18 days would be March 18 (day 28 + 18 = 46). But according to the other calculation, March 18 is day 44. So there's a discrepancy here. Which is correct? \n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the days. Let's count the days between February 2 and March 18. \n\nFrom February 2 to February 28: that's 28 - 2 = 26 days. Then March 1 to March 18 is 18 days. So total is 26 + 18 = 44 days. So that would mean that March 18 is 44 days after February 2. Therefore, adding 2 more days would be March 20, which is 46 days. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought that 28 days later is February 28 (which is day 28), then adding 18 days would be March 18 (day 28 + 18 = 46). But that's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe the error is in the initial assumption that 28 days later is February 28. If February 2 is day 0, then February 2 + 28 days is February 2 + 28 days. Let's count: February has 28 days. So February 2 + 28 days would be February 2 + 28 days. Wait, if February 2 is day 0, then February 3 is day 1, ..., February 28 is day 26. Then February 29 would be day 27, but 2022 is not a leap year, so February 28 is the last day. So adding 28 days to February 2 would be March 1 (since 28 days later). Wait, that's a key mistake. \n\nAh! Here's the error. If I start on February 2, then adding 28 days would be February 2 + 28 days. Since February has 28 days, adding 28 days would take me to March 1. Because from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since 28 - 2 = 26). Then adding 2 more days would be March 1. So 28 days later is March 1. Therefore, my previous calculation was wrong. \n\nSo that changes things. So if 28 days later is March 1, then adding 18 days to March 1 would be March 1 + 18 days. March has 31 days, so March 1 + 18 days is March 19. Therefore, 28 + 18 = 46 days. So March 19 would be 46 days after February 2. \n\nBut that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought March 18 was 46 days. So which is correct? \n\nWait, let's do this step by step. Let's count the days from February 2 to March 1. \n\nFebruary 2 is day 0. \n\nFebruary 3 is day 1. \n\n... \n\nFebruary 28 is day 26. \n\nThen March 1 is day 27. \n\nWait, that's 27 days from February 2 to March 1. So adding 28 days would be March 2. Wait, no. Wait, if February 2 is day 0, then March 1 is day 27. So adding 28 days would be March 2 (day 28). \n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to use a different approach. Let's use the fact that 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday. So Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday. \n\nBut according to the previous calculation where I thought that 28 days later is March 1, then adding 18 days would be March 19. So March 19 is 46 days after February 2. Let's check what day of the week that is. \n\nIf March 1 is day 27, which is 27 days after February 2. Since 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So 3 weeks later is Wednesday again, then adding 6 days: Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday). So March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 1 + 18 days is March 19. Let's count 18 days from March 1. \n\nMarch 1 is Tuesday. Adding 7 days is March 8 (Tuesday). Adding another 7 days is March 15 (Tuesday). Adding another 7 days is March 22 (Tuesday). Then adding 4 more days: March 23 (Wednesday), 24 (Thursday), 25 (Friday), 26 (Saturday), 27 (Sunday), 28 (Monday), 29 (Tuesday), 30 (Wednesday), 31 (Thursday). Wait, but 18 days from March 1 is March 19. Wait, March 1 is day 0. Then March 8 is +7, March 15 is +14, March 22 is +21, then March 22 + 7 is March 29 (day 28). Wait, but 18 days from March 1 is March 19. So March 19 is 18 days after March 1. \n\nSo March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 19 is 18 days later. Let's count 18 days. 14 days is 2 weeks, so March 1 + 14 days is March 15 (Tuesday). Then 4 more days: March 16 (Wednesday), 17 (Thursday), 18 (Friday), 19 (Saturday). So March 19 is Saturday. \n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, adding 4 days to Wednesday should be Sunday. But here, according to this, March 19 is Saturday. That's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here? \n\nAh! The mistake is in the initial assumption that 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days. Wait, 46 divided by 7 is 6*7=42, remainder 4. So 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday should be Sunday. But according to the other calculation, March 19 is Saturday. So there's a conflict here. \n\nThis means that one of the methods is wrong. Let me check again. \n\nFirst, let's check the day of the week for March 1. If February 2 is Wednesday, then February 2 is day 0. Let's count the days from February 2 to March 1. \n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since 28 - 2 = 26). Then March 1 is the next day. So 26 + 1 = 27 days. So March 1 is 27 days after February 2. \n\nNow, 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 6 days. So 21 days later is Wednesday again. Then adding 6 days: Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. So March 1 is Tuesday. \n\nThen, adding 18 days to March 1 (which is 46 days total) would be March 19. As calculated earlier, March 19 is Saturday. But according to the other method, adding 4 days to Wednesday should be Sunday. So why the discrepancy? \n\nAh! Because the error is in the initial assumption that 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days. Wait, 6 weeks is 42 days. 46 - 42 = 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday should be Sunday. But according to the other calculation, it's Saturday. So which is correct? \n\nWait, maybe the error is in the calculation of the day of the week for March 1. Let me check again. \n\nIf February 2 is Wednesday, then February 3 is Thursday. Let's count the days in February. February has 28 days. So February 2 is day 0 (Wednesday). Then February 3 is day 1 (Thursday), ..., February 28 is day 26. Then March 1 is day 27. \n\nNow, 27 divided by 7 is 3*7=21, remainder 6. So 21 days later is Wednesday again. Then adding 6 days: Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. So March 1 is Tuesday. \n\nThen, adding 18 days to March 1 (which is 27 + 18 = 45 days? Wait, no. Wait, March 1 is day 27. Adding 18 days would be day 27 + 18 = 45. Wait, but 46 days from February 2 would be day 46. So maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, if February 2 is day 0, then March 1 is day 27. Then adding 18 days would be day 27 + 18 = 45. So that's 45 days. But we need 46 days. So that means that March 19 is day 45, and March 20 is day 46. \n\nSo March 20 is 46 days after February 2. \n\nSo earlier, I thought that March 19 was 46 days, but that was a mistake. So March 20 is the correct date. \n\nSo March 20 is 46 days after February 2. Now, let's check what day"], [99, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, December 4, 2022, to Saturday, January 14, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates. Wait, the start date is Sunday, December 4, 2022, and the end date is Saturday, January 14, 2022. Wait, but January 14 is after December 4, so the period is from December 4 to January 14. But I need to make sure that the dates are correct. Let me confirm the actual dates. December 4, 2022 is a Sunday. Then, January 14, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, but wait, 2022 is a non-leap year. Let me check the actual days of the week for those dates. But maybe I can just proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total number of days between December 4 and January 14, inclusive, and then subtract the weekends. But since the start and end dates are given, I need to make sure that both are included. However, the problem says \"inclusive of both dates,\" so both dates are counted.\n\nBut first, let me figure out the total number of days between those two dates. Let's break it down into months. December has 31 days. So from December 4 to December 31, that's 31 - 4 = 27 days, but since we include December 4, it's 27 + 1 = 28 days? Wait, no. Wait, if I start on December 4, then the number of days from December 4 to December 31 inclusive is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days. Then, January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total days would be 28 + 14 = 42 days. Wait, but that's if the period is from December 4 to January 14 inclusive. Let me check that again. Let me count the days in December: December 4 to December 31 is 28 days (since 31-4=27, plus 1 for the inclusive). Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total days is 28 + 14 = 42 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 42 days.\n\nBut now, I need to subtract the weekends. So how many weekends are there in this period? Let's see. The start date is Sunday, December 4. So December 4 is a Sunday. Then December 5 is Monday, and so on. Let me list the days of the week for each month.\n\nFirst, December 4 is Sunday. So December 4 (Sunday), 5 (Monday), 6 (Tuesday), 7 (Wednesday), 8 (Thursday), 9 (Friday), 10 (Saturday), 11 (Sunday), 12 (Monday), 13 (Tuesday), 14 (Wednesday), 15 (Thursday), 16 (Friday), 17 (Saturday), 18 (Sunday), 19 (Monday), 20 (Tuesday), 21 (Wednesday), 22 (Thursday), 23 (Friday), 24 (Saturday), 25 (Sunday), 26 (Monday), 27 (Tuesday), 28 (Wednesday), 29 (Thursday), 30 (Friday), 31 (Saturday). So December has 31 days. So from December 4 to December 31, that's 28 days. Let me check the weekends in December. The first weekend is December 4 (Sunday) and 5 (Monday)? Wait, no. Wait, December 4 is Sunday. Then the next weekend is December 5 (Monday) is not a weekend. Wait, weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So in December, the weekends would be:\n\nDecember 4 is Sunday (so that's a weekend day). Then December 5 is Monday (not a weekend). Then December 6 is Tuesday, etc. Wait, the first weekend is December 4 (Sunday) and December 5 is Monday. Wait, no. Wait, the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. So December 4 is Sunday, so that's a weekend. Then the next Saturday is December 10 (since December 4 is Sunday, the next Saturday is 6 days later: 4 + 6 = 10). So December 10 is Saturday. Then December 11 is Sunday. Then December 17 (Saturday), 18 (Sunday), December 24 (Saturday), 25 (Sunday), and December 31 is Saturday. Wait, December 31 is Saturday? Let me check. December 4 is Sunday. Let's count the days:\n\nDecember 4: Sunday\n\nDecember 5: Monday\n\nDecember 6: Tuesday\n\nDecember 7: Wednesday\n\nDecember 8: Thursday\n\nDecember 9: Friday\n\nDecember 10: Saturday\n\nDecember 11: Sunday\n\nDecember 12: Monday\n\nDecember 13: Tuesday\n\nDecember 14: Wednesday\n\nDecember 15: Thursday\n\nDecember 16: Friday\n\nDecember 17: Saturday\n\nDecember 18: Sunday\n\nDecember 19: Monday\n\nDecember 20: Tuesday\n\nDecember 21: Wednesday\n\nDecember 22: Thursday\n\nDecember 23: Friday\n\nDecember 24: Saturday\n\nDecember 25: Sunday\n\nDecember 26: Monday\n\nDecember 27: Tuesday\n\nDecember 28: Wednesday\n\nDecember 29: Thursday\n\nDecember 30: Friday\n\nDecember 31: Saturday\n\nYes, so December 31 is Saturday. So in December, the weekends are:\n\nDecember 4 (Sunday), 10 (Saturday), 11 (Sunday), 17 (Saturday), 18 (Sunday), 24 (Saturday), 25 (Sunday), 31 (Saturday). Wait, but December 31 is Saturday. So that's 8 weekend days in December? Let me count:\n\nWeekends in December:\n\n- December 4 (Sunday)\n\n- December 5 is Monday, not a weekend. Wait, no. Wait, the weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So in December, the weekends are:\n\nSaturday: 10, 17, 24, 31 (four Saturdays)\n\nSunday: 4, 11, 18, 25 (four Sundays)\n\nSo total of 8 weekend days in December. But wait, December 4 is Sunday, which is included. So that's 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays, total 8 weekend days in December.\n\nNow, moving to January. The period ends on January 14, which is a Saturday. So January 1 to January 14. Let's check the days of the week for January. Since December 31 is Saturday, January 1 is Sunday. Then January 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, 3 is Tuesday, 4 is Wednesday, 5 is Thursday, 6 is Friday, 7 is Saturday, 8 is Sunday, 9 is Monday, 10 is Tuesday, 11 is Wednesday, 12 is Thursday, 13 is Friday, 14 is Saturday.\n\nSo in January, the weekends are:\n\nJanuary 1 (Sunday), 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday), 14 (Saturday). So that's 3 Saturdays and 2 Sundays? Wait:\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\n\nJanuary 2: Monday\n\nJanuary 3: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 4: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 5: Thursday\n\nJanuary 6: Friday\n\nJanuary 7: Saturday\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday\n\nJanuary 9: Monday\n\nJanuary 10: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 11: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 12: Thursday\n\nJanuary 13: Friday\n\nJanuary 14: Saturday\n\nSo the weekends in January are:\n\nJanuary 1 (Sunday), 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday), 14 (Saturday). That's 2 Saturdays (7 and 14) and 2 Sundays (1 and 8). Wait, that's 4 weekend days in January. Wait, but January 14 is included in the end date. So in January, from January 1 to January 14, there are 4 weekend days: 1 (Sunday), 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday), 14 (Saturday). So that's 4 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekend days in the entire period (December 4 to January 14 inclusive) are 8 (December) + 4 (January) = 12 weekend days.\n\nBut wait, the total days are 42. So business days would be 42 - 12 = 30. But wait, let me check again. Wait, the total days from December 4 to January 14 inclusive is 42 days. But if there are 12 weekend days, then 42 - 12 = 30 business days. But let me check again the count of weekends.\n\nWait, in December, the weekends are 8 days. In January, 4 days. So 8 + 4 = 12. So 42 - 12 = 30. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of business days by counting each week. Let's see. Starting from December 4 (Sunday) to January 14 (Saturday). Let's see how many weeks and days that is.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to calculate the number of weeks between the dates and then adjust for the remaining days. But perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can check the total days again.\n\nWait, December 4 to December 31 is 28 days. Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So 28 + 14 = 42 days. That's correct. So 42 days total.\n\nNow, the weekends in December: 8 days. In January: 4 days. So 12 total. So 42 - 12 = 30 business days. But wait, let me check if the start and end dates are included. The start date is Sunday, December 4, which is a weekend day. But since the problem says inclusive, that day is counted. Similarly, the end date is Saturday, January 14, which is also a weekend day. So in the total count of 42 days, both the start and end dates are included. So when we subtract the weekends, we need to make sure that those days are subtracted. So if the start date is a weekend, it's included in the 8 days of December weekends. Similarly, the end date is a Saturday, which is included in the 4 days of January weekends. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the actual count of weekends again. For December, the weekends are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. So 8 days. For January, 2 Saturdays (7 and 14) and 2 Sundays (1 and 8). So 4 days. So total 12. So 42 - 12 = 30. So the answer would be 30 business days. But wait, let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the business days step by step. Starting from December 4 (Sunday) to January 14 (Saturday). Let's count the business days.\n\nFirst, December 4 is Sunday (non-business). Then December 5 is Monday (business). December 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri), 31 (Sat). Then January 1 (Sun), 2 (Mon), 3 (Tue), 4 (Wed), 5 (Thu), 6 (Fri), 7 (Sat), 8 (Sun), 9 (Mon), 10 (Tue), 11 (Wed), 12 (Thu), 13 (Fri), 14 (Sat).\n\nNow, let's count the business days (Mon-Fri) from Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive.\n\nStarting with Dec 4: Sunday (non-business). So first business day is Dec 5.\n\nLet me list each day and mark if it's business:\n\nDec 4: Sunday (non)\n\nDec 5: Mon (yes)\n\nDec 6: Tue (yes)\n\nDec 7: Wed (yes)\n\nDec 8: Thu (yes)\n\nDec 9: Fri (yes)\n\nDec 10: Sat (no)\n\nDec 11: Sun (no)\n\nDec 12: Mon (yes)\n\nDec 13: Tue (yes)\n\nDec 14: Wed (yes)\n\nDec 15: Thu (yes)\n\nDec 16: Fri (yes)\n\nDec 17: Sat (no)\n\nDec 18: Sun (no)\n\nDec 19: Mon (yes)\n\nDec 20: Tue (yes)\n\nDec 21: Wed (yes)\n\nDec 22: Thu (yes)\n\nDec 23: Fri (yes)\n\nDec 24: Sat (no)\n\nDec 25: Sun (no)\n\nDec 26: Mon (yes)\n\nDec 27: Tue (yes)\n\nDec 28: Wed (yes)\n\nDec 29: Thu (yes)\n\nDec 30: Fri (yes)\n\nDec 31: Sat (no)\n\nJan 1: Sun (no)\n\nJan 2: Mon (yes)\n\nJan 3: Tue (yes)\n\nJan 4: Wed (yes)\n\nJan 5: Thu (yes)\n\nJan 6: Fri (yes)\n\nJan 7: Sat (no)\n\nJan 8: Sun (no)\n\nJan 9: Mon (yes)\n\nJan 10: Tue (yes)\n\nJan 11: Wed (yes)\n\nJan 12: Thu (yes)\n\nJan 13: Fri (yes)\n\nJan 14: Sat (no)\n\nNow, let's count the number of \"yes\" entries. Let's go through each day:\n\nDec 5: 1\n\nDec 6: 2\n\nDec 7: 3\n\nDec 8: 4\n\nDec 9: 5\n\nDec 12: 6\n\nDec 13: 7\n\nDec 14: 8\n\nDec 15: 9\n\nDec 16: 10\n\nDec 19: 11\n\nDec 20: 12\n\nDec 21: 13\n\nDec 22: 14\n\nDec 23: 15\n\nDec 26: 16\n\nDec 27: 17\n\nDec 28: 18\n\nDec 29: 19\n\nDec 30: 20\n\nJan 2: 21\n\nJan 3: 22\n\nJan 4: 23\n\nJan 5: 24\n\nJan 6: 25\n\nJan 9: 26\n\nJan 10: 27\n\nJan 11: 28\n\nJan 12: 29\n\nJan 13: 30\n\nSo that's 30 business days. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 30.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because when I listed the days, I counted 30 business days. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 30.\n</think>", "30"], [99, "On which weekday did June 26, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 26, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because January 1, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no, because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 would start on a Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday? Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Wait, if 2021 started on a Monday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would mean that January 1, 2022 is a Monday plus 1 day, which is Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean that January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. But I think I might be confused here. Let me check another way. Maybe I can look up some known dates. Wait, but since I can't actually look things up, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about some other dates. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, July 4, 2022. Let me think. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then maybe I can work backwards. Let's see. Let's check the days between June 26 and July 4. June has 30 days, so from June 26 to June 30 is 4 days. Then July 1 to July 4 is 4 days. So total of 8 days. If July 4 is a Monday, then June 26 would be 8 days before that. Since 8 days before Monday is Monday minus 8 days. Let's count: 7 days before is Monday again, so 8 days before would be Sunday. Wait, that would mean June 26, 2022 was a Sunday? But wait, I'm not sure if July 4, 2022 was actually a Monday. Maybe I'm wrong about that. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 8 is Wednesday, June 15, 22, 29. So June 29 is Wednesday. Then June 26 would be 3 days before June 29, which would be Sunday. So that would mean June 26 is Sunday. But wait, if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 26 is 25 days later. Let me check that. 25 days divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday would be Sunday. So that would be correct. But how do I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday? Maybe I can check another way. Let's think about April 1, 2022. Wait, I think April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me see. If April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. Then May 6 is Friday. Then May 13, 20, 27. Then June 3 is Friday. So June 3 is Friday. Then June 1 is 2 days before that, which would be Wednesday. So that matches. So June 1 is Wednesday. Therefore, June 26 is 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 4 days. So Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. Therefore, June 26, 2022 was a Sunday. But wait, I need to make sure that my assumption about April 1, 2022 being a Friday is correct. Let me check again. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then April 8 is Friday. Then May 6 is Friday. Then May 13, 20, 27. Then June 3 is Friday. So June 3 is Friday. Then June 1 is two days before, which is Wednesday. That seems correct. So that would mean June 26 is Sunday. Alternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then June 26 is 5 days before. So Friday minus 5 days is Sunday. That would also confirm that June 26 is Sunday. Wait, but if July 1 is Friday, then June 26 is 5 days earlier. Let me count: July 1 is Friday. June 26 is 5 days before. So June 26 is Friday minus 5 days. Let's count backwards: June 26 (Sunday), June 27 (Monday), June 28 (Tuesday), June 29 (Wednesday), June 30 (Thursday), July 1 (Friday). So yes, June 26 is Sunday. Therefore, that's consistent.

Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to recall. Let me think about the year 2021. January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 started on a Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So if that's the case, then January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, let's count the days from January 1 to June 29, 2022. Let's break it down month by month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days in 2022 (since it's not a leap year). March has 31 days, April 30, May 31, and June has 30 days. So up to June 29, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 29 (June). Wait, June 29 is 29 days in June. So total days from January 1 to June 29 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 29. Let me calculate that. 31 + 28 is 59. 59 + 31 is 90. 90 + 30 is 120. 120 + 31 is 151. 151 + 29 is 180 days. So 180 days from January 1, 2022. Now, since January 1 is a Saturday, adding 180 days. Now, 180 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 5 days. So 25 weeks is 175 days, so 180 days is 25 weeks and 5 days. Therefore, adding 5 days to Saturday. Saturday + 1 day is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday, +5 is Thursday. Therefore, June 29, 2022 would be a Thursday? But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought July 4 was Monday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then January 1 is day 0. Then January 8 is also a Saturday. So each week is 7 days. So adding 180 days. Let me check the total days again. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days from January 1 to June 29. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days)\nFebruary: 28 days (so up to Feb 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days)\nMarch: 31 days (up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90 days)\nApril: 30 days (up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120 days)\nMay: 31 days (up to May 31 is 120 + 31 = 151 days)\nJune: 29 days (since June 29 is the date we're looking for, so up to June 29 is 151 + 29 = 180 days). So that's correct. So 180 days from January 1. Now, 180 divided by 7 is 25*7=175, remainder 5. So 25 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Saturday. Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. So that would mean June 29 is a Thursday. But earlier I thought that July 4 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday. Let's see. If June 29 is Thursday, then June 30 is Friday, July 1 is Saturday. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, if June 29 is Thursday, then June 30 is Friday, July 1 is Saturday. But if July 4 is Monday, then July 1 would be Thursday. That's a contradiction. So there's a mistake here. Therefore, my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday must be wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check again. I thought that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 starts on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. But maybe that's incorrect. Wait, if January 1, 2021 is a Friday, then adding 365 days would be 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. But maybe that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4, 2021 is Monday, then July 4, 2022 would be 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So July 4, 2022 would be Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. But I thought earlier that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe I was wrong about July 4, 2021. Let me think. Wait, I think July 4, 2021 was actually a Sunday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Wait, if that's correct, then 2022 would be one year before. Since 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days. 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then January 1, 2022 would be Sunday minus 1 day, which is Saturday. So that would mean January 1, 2022 is Saturday. But then, if July 4, 2022 is 183 days after January 1, 2022. Let me calculate that. January has 31 days, so 31 days in January. February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 4. Wait, from January 1 to July 4 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +4=185 days. So 185 days from January 1, 2022. If January 1 is Saturday, then 185 days later. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So 26 weeks is 182 days, so 185 is 182 + 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. Therefore, July 4, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But I thought earlier that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 is Saturday is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another known date. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If December 25 is Sunday, then let's count back to June 29. Let's see. From June 29 to December 25 is 189 days (June has 30 days, so June 29 to June 30 is 1 day, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 25. Wait, that's 1 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 25 (December) = 1 + 31=32, +31=63, +30=93, +31=124, +30=154, +25=179 days. So 179 days from June 29 to December 25. If December 25 is Sunday, then June 29 is 179 days before. 179 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 4 days. So 25 weeks is 175 days, so 179 is 175 +4. So subtracting 4 days from Sunday. Sunday minus 1 day is Saturday, minus 2 is Friday, minus 3 is Thursday, minus 4 is Wednesday. Therefore, June 29 would be a Wednesday. But this contradicts the previous calculation where I thought it was Thursday or Tuesday. So now I'm really confused. There must be a mistake in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let me check the actual day of the week for June 29, 2022. Wait, but since I can't look it up, I need to find a way to verify. Let me try using Zeller's Congruence. The formula for Zeller's Congruence for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, I need to adjust the month and year accordingly. So for June 29, 2022, the month is June, which is month 6. So m = 6, q = 29, year is 2022. So K = 22, J = 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (29 + floor((13*(6 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nfloor((13*7)/5) = floor(91/5) = floor(18.2) = 18\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n29 + 18 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 29 + 18 is 47, +22 is 69, +5 is 74, +5 is 79, +100 is 179.\n\nNow, 179 mod 7. Let's divide 179 by 7. 7*25=175, so 179-175=4. So h=4.\n\nAccording to Zeller's Congruence, h=4 corresponds to Thursday (since 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, 4=Wednesday, 5=Thursday, 6=Friday). Wait, no, wait. Wait the formula says h is 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, 4=Wednesday, 5=Thursday, 6=Friday. So h=4 is Wednesday. But according to my previous calculation using the days from January 1, I thought it was Thursday or Wednesday. But according to Zeller's Congruence, it's Wednesday. So that would mean that June 29, 2022 is a Wednesday. But earlier when I thought that December 25 was Sunday, and calculated that June 29 was Wednesday, that matches. So that must be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is Wednesday. But why did I get conflicting results earlier?\n\nLet me check again. If Zeller's Congruence says Wednesday, then that's the correct answer. So maybe my previous calculation where I thought that January 1, 2022 was Saturday was correct, but then when I calculated the days from January 1 to June 29 as 180 days, which is 25 weeks and 5 days, adding 5 days to Saturday would be Thursday. But that contradicts Zeller's result. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's calculation. Let me check again. The formula is h = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7. Wait, but for the month of June, m is 6. So the formula is correct. Let me recheck the calculation:\n\nq = 29\n\nfloor((13*(6+1))/5) = floor(91/5) = 18.2 \u2192 18. Correct.\n\nK = 22 (2022 mod 100 is 22)\n\nfloor(K/4) = floor(22/4) = 5. Correct.\n\nfloor(J/4) = floor(20/4) = 5. Correct.\n\n5*J = 5*20 = 100. Correct.\n\nSo total is 29 + 18 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 179. 179 mod 7 is 4. So h=4, which is Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer is Wednesday. So why did my previous calculation with January 1 being Saturday give me Thursday? Let me check that again. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then adding 180 days. 180 divided by 7 is 25*7=175,"], [99, "What day of the week was May 31, 2022? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week May 31, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that again. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 31, 2022 is a certain number of days away from a known date. Let's say I take a date I know. For example, if I know that May 1, 2022 was a Monday, then May 31 would be 30 days later. Wait, but that might not be correct. Wait, May has 31 days, so May 1 is the first day. So May 31 is 30 days after May 1. Wait, but if May 1 is a Monday, then adding 30 days would be 30 days later. Since 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if May 1 is a Monday, then May 31 would be 2 days after Monday, which is Wednesday. But wait, that would be if May 1 is a Monday. But I need to check if that's accurate.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm what day May 1, 2022 was. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Wait, if I can find that, then I can count the days from April 1 to May 31. Let's see. April has 30 days, so April 1 to April 30 is 29 days. Then May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. So total days from April 1 to May 31 is 29 + 31 = 60 days. Wait, but if April 1 is a Friday, then adding 60 days would be 60 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 4 days. So Friday plus 4 days is Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean May 31 is a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if April 1 was a Friday. Maybe I need to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that May 2, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should check online? But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Saturdays. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. March 5, 12, 19, 26, April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 would be Saturdays. Then May 7, 14, 21, 28 would be Saturdays. So May 28, 2022 was a Saturday. Then May 28 is Saturday, so May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. Wait, that would make May 31, 2022 a Tuesday. But I need to confirm if January 1, 2022 was indeed a Saturday. Let me think again. Wait, I think that's correct. Because 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 started on a Saturday. Because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021 was a Monday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday? Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me check again. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday. Then 2021 had 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So the next year would start one day later. So January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But that contradicts my previous thought that it was a Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check a different way. Let me think about some other dates. For example, I know that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, July 4, 2021 was a Sunday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should use another approach. Let me think about the fact that May 31, 2022 is the day in question. If I can find a date that I know is a certain day, and then count the days between that date and May 31, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 28, 2022 was a Saturday. If that's correct, then May 28 is Saturday, so May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that would make May 31, 2022 a Tuesday. But I need to confirm if May 28 is indeed a Saturday. How can I check that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then April 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Fridays. Then May 6, 13, 20, 27 would be Fridays. So May 27 is a Friday. Then May 28 is Saturday, May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that would again lead to Tuesday. But how do I know if April 1, 2022 was a Friday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, if March 1 is Tuesday, then March 8, 15, 22, 29 are Tuesdays. Then April 5, 12, 19, 26 are Tuesdays. So April 5 is a Tuesday. Then April 1 is three days before April 5, so April 1 would be Saturday. Wait, that would mean April 1 is a Saturday. But that contradicts the previous thought that April 1 was a Friday. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the days of the week for a specific date. Let me think. For example, I know that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Let me check that. If March 1 is Tuesday, then March 2 is Wednesday, March 3 is Thursday, March 4 is Friday, March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday. Then March 7 is Monday. March 8 is Tuesday. So March 8 is Tuesday. Then March 15 is Tuesday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 29 is Tuesday. Then April 5 is Tuesday. April 5 is Tuesday. Then April 6 is Wednesday, April 7 is Thursday, April 8 is Friday, April 9 is Saturday, April 10 is Sunday, April 11 is Monday, April 12 is Tuesday. So April 12 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is 11 days before April 12. 11 days is 1 week and 4 days. So if April 12 is Tuesday, then April 1 would be Tuesday minus 4 days, which is Friday. So April 1 is a Friday. Therefore, April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Then, as before, April 1 is Friday, so April 8 is Friday, April 15 is Friday, April 22 is Friday, April 29 is Friday. Then May 6 is Friday, May 13 is Friday, May 20 is Friday, May 27 is Friday. So May 27 is Friday. Then May 28 is Saturday, May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, May 31, 2022 is a Tuesday. So that would be the answer.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that March 1, 2022 was indeed a Tuesday. How can I confirm that? Let me think. If I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then I can count the days. January has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday, February 12 is Saturday, February 19 is Saturday, February 26 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday. Then March 5 is Saturday. So March 5 is Saturday. Then March 1 is 4 days before March 5. So March 1 would be Tuesday. Because March 5 is Saturday, March 4 is Friday, March 3 is Thursday, March 2 is Wednesday, March 1 is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Therefore, April 1 is a Friday. Therefore, May 31 is a Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [99, "Count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022 - what's the weekday? Reply with just the weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week it was 81 days before Tuesday, October 4, 2022. Let me start by understanding the problem. The question is asking to count backward 81 days from that date and find the corresponding weekday.\n\nFirst, I should confirm the starting date: Tuesday, October 4, 2022. Let me check if that's correct. October 4, 2022, was indeed a Tuesday. So that's the starting point.\n\nNow, I need to subtract 81 days from this date. But how do I do that? Well, maybe I can break down the 81 days into weeks and remaining days. Since a week has 7 days, 81 divided by 7 gives me the number of weeks and the remainder will be the extra days. Let me calculate that.\n\n81 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 4 days because 11*7 is 77, and 81-77 is 4. So, subtracting 81 days is the same as subtracting 11 weeks and 4 days. Since subtracting weeks doesn't change the day of the week, the key is to subtract 4 days from Tuesday.\n\nWait, but wait. If I subtract 4 days from Tuesday, what day would that be? Let's count backward. Tuesday minus 1 day is Monday, minus 2 days is Sunday, minus 3 days is Saturday, and minus 4 days is Friday. So, if I subtract 4 days from Tuesday, it should be Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this by actually counting the days step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with dates, especially across month boundaries, the number of days in each month can affect the calculation. However, since the problem is just about subtracting days and not worrying about the exact date, maybe the initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the day of the week. If I subtract 81 days, which is 11 weeks and 4 days, then the day of the week would be 4 days earlier. So, Tuesday minus 4 days is Friday. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's take the starting date, October 4, 2022, and subtract 81 days. Let me try to compute the date first, then check the day of the week.\n\nStarting with October 4, 2022. Let's subtract 81 days. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, subtract 77 days (11 weeks) to get to October 4 minus 77 days. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 7 days is September 27. Then subtract another 7 days (total 14 days) to get September 20. Then another 7 days (21 days) to September 13, then 28 days (September 6), 35 days (August 29), 42 days (August 22), 49 days (August 15), 56 days (August 8), 63 days (August 1), 70 days (July 25), 77 days (July 18). Wait, that's 77 days. So October 4 minus 77 days is July 18, 2022. Then subtract the remaining 4 days: July 18 minus 4 days is July 14, 2022. Now, I need to check what day of the week July 14, 2022, was.\n\nBut how do I know that? Well, I can check if I remember the days or use a reference. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July 18, 2022, was a Monday (since July 18, 2022, was a Monday, as I recall). Wait, if July 18 is a Monday, then July 14 would be 4 days earlier, which would be Sunday (July 14 is 4 days before July 18). Wait, but that contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if I subtract 4 days from July 18 (Monday), then July 17 is Sunday, July 16 is Saturday, July 15 is Friday, July 14 is Thursday. Wait, that's different. So if July 18 is a Monday, then July 14 would be Thursday. But according to my previous calculation, subtracting 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday. But here, according to this date calculation, it's Thursday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this suggests that my initial approach was wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check the day of the week for July 18, 2022. Let me think. I know that October 4, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check the days for July 2022. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to rely on my memory or another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me recall. 2022 started on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then, let's count the days from January 1 to July 18, 2022.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Sunday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 18.\n\nSo total days from January 1 to July 18 is:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (31 days)\nFebruary: 28 days (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 18 (199)\n\nSo July 18 is the 199th day of 2022. Since January 1 is a Sunday, the 1st day is Sunday. So the 1st day is Sunday, 2nd is Monday, etc. To find the day of the week for the 199th day, we can calculate 199 mod 7. 199 divided by 7 is 28 weeks (196 days) with a remainder of 3. So 199 mod 7 is 3. So the 199th day is 3 days after Sunday. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Wait, but that would mean July 18, 2022, was a Wednesday? But earlier I thought it was a Monday. That's conflicting. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check another way. For example, I know that October 4, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let's count the days from January 1, 2022, to October 4, 2022, and see if that gives the correct day.\n\nJanuary has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 4.\n\nTotal days from January 1 to October 4 is:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n\n+31 (Mar) = 90\n\n+30 (Apr) = 120\n\n+31 (May) = 151\n\n+30 (Jun) = 181\n\n+31 (Jul) = 212\n\n+31 (Aug) = 243\n\n+30 (Sep) = 273\n\n+4 (Oct) = 277 days.\n\nSo October 4 is the 277th day of 2022. If January 1 is a Sunday, then 277 mod 7 is 277 / 7 = 39*7=273, remainder 4. So 277 mod 7 is 4. So the 277th day is 4 days after Sunday, which is Thursday. But according to the problem, October 4, 2022, was a Tuesday. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. Let me check again. Maybe I need to find the correct day of the week for January 1, 2022. Alternatively, perhaps I can use another known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So 2022 was a year before that. Since 2022 is not a leap year, the day of the week advances by one day each year. Wait, but 2022 is not a leap year, so 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023, is one day later in the week than January 1, 2022. Since January 1, 2023, is a Sunday, then January 1, 2022, must be a Saturday. Wait, that makes sense. Because 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 started on Saturday. So that's correct.\n\nSo January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Therefore, my previous calculation was wrong. Let me recalculate the day of the week for July 18, 2022.\n\nSo January 1, 2022, is a Saturday. Let's calculate the day of the week for July 18, 2022. The total number of days from January 1 to July 18 is 199 days, as before. 199 days from Saturday. Let's compute 199 mod 7. 199 divided by 7 is 28*7=196, remainder 3. So 199 days is 28 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday: Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday. Therefore, July 18, 2022, was a Tuesday. Wait, but earlier I thought that October 4 was a Tuesday. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom January 1 (Saturday) to October 4 is 277 days. 277 mod 7 is 277 - 273 (39*7) = 4. So 4 days after Saturday is Wednesday. But the problem states that October 4, 2022, was a Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. What's the error here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days from January 1 to October 4. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\n\nFebruary: 28 (2022 is not a leap year)\n\nMarch: 31\n\nApril: 30\n\nMay: 31\n\nJune: 30\n\nJuly: 31\n\nAugust: 31\n\nSeptember: 30\n\nOctober: 4\n\nSo adding them up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 = 59\n\n+31 (Mar) = 90\n\n+30 (Apr) = 120\n\n+31 (May) = 151\n\n+30 (Jun) = 181\n\n+31 (Jul) = 212\n\n+31 (Aug) = 243\n\n+30 (Sep) = 273\n\n+4 (Oct) = 277. So that's correct. So 277 days from January 1, 2022, is October 4, 2022. If January 1 is a Saturday, then 277 days later is 277 mod 7 = 4. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. But the problem says it's Tuesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which means that my assumption that January 1, 2022, is a Saturday is wrong. But how?\n\nWait, maybe I got the day of the week for January 1, 2023, wrong. Let me check that. I think that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. Let me confirm. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023, should be a Sunday. That's correct. So if that's the case, then October 4, 2022, should be 277 days after January 1, 2022. 277 mod 7 is 4. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. But the problem says it's Tuesday. Therefore, there's a mistake here. But the problem states that October 4, 2022, was a Tuesday. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. Alternatively, maybe the problem is incorrect? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days from January 1 to October 4. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90. April has 30 days, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120. May has 31 days, so up to May 31 is 120 + 31 = 151. June has 30 days, so up to June 30 is 151 + 30 = 181. July has 31 days, so up to July 31 is 181 + 31 = 212. August has 31 days, so up to August 31 is 212 + 31 = 243. September has 30 days, so up to September 30 is 243 + 30 = 273. Then October 4 is 273 + 4 = 277 days. So that's correct. Therefore, the problem must be that my assumption about January 1, 2022, being a Saturday is wrong. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022, was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 18 is 14 days later. 14 days is 2 weeks, so July 18 would also be a Monday. But according to my previous calculation, July 18 was a Tuesday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there's a problem here. So maybe my initial assumption about January 1, 2022, is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's take the known date of October 4, 2022, as Tuesday. Let's count backward 81 days. Let's try to find the date 81 days before October 4, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. So subtracting 11 weeks (77 days) from October 4, 2022, would bring us to October 4 minus 77 days. Let's calculate that date.\n\nOctober has 31 days. October 4 minus 7 days is September 27. Then subtract another 7 days (total 14 days) is September 20. Subtract another 7 (21 days) is September 13. Subtract 7 (28 days) is September 6. Subtract 7 (35 days) is August 29. Subtract 7 (42 days) is August 22. Subtract 7 (49 days) is August 15. Subtract 7 (56 days) is August 8. Subtract 7 (63 days) is August 1. Subtract 7 (70 days) is July 25. Subtract 7 (77 days) is July 18. So July 18, 2022, is 77 days before October 4, 2022. Then subtract 4 more days to get to July 14, 2022. So July 14 is 81 days before October 4.\n\nNow, if October 4 is a Tuesday, then July 14 is 81 days before. Now, I need to find the day of the week for July 14, 2022. Let's see. If I can find the day of the week for July 14, 2022, then that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that July 4, 2022, was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday,"], [99, "If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? Reply with just the weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? I need to figure out the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the first day of the year is Saturday. So January 1st is a Saturday. Now, I need to find out what day of the week March 25th is. To do this, I should calculate the number of days between January 1st and March 25th, then find the remainder when divided by 7, since the days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n\nLet me break it down. January has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. But since the first day of the year is Saturday, maybe we can assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed to not require knowing if it's a leap year? Wait, but March 25th is in the same year, so if the year is a leap year, February would have 29 days. But the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. Maybe I should check if the year is a leap year based on the given information. Wait, the first day of the year is Saturday. If the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But how can I determine that? Well, the problem might be assuming a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, the number of days in February would be different, which would affect the total days between January 1st and March 25th. So maybe I need to check if the year is a leap year. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the first day of the year was a Saturday\". If the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But the problem doesn't specify. However, since the problem is asking for March 25th, which is after February, maybe the answer is the same regardless? Or maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Wait, but maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, no. Let me think again. If the year is a leap year, then the total days from January 1st to March 25th would be 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 25 (March) = 85 days. If it's not a leap year, then it's 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. So the difference is 1 day. Therefore, the day of the week would be different. But how do I know if it's a leap year?\n\nWait, the problem says that the first day of the year is Saturday. If the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But how does that affect the first day of the year? Wait, the first day of the year is given as Saturday. So maybe the problem is assuming that the year is not a leap year? Because if it were a leap year, then the next year would start on a different day. But the problem doesn't mention anything about the next year. Wait, but the problem is only about the current year. So maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to not require knowing whether it's a leap year. Wait, but how can that be? Because the number of days in February affects the total days. So maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check the problem again. The problem says \"the first day of the year was a Saturday\". It doesn't mention anything about the year being a leap year. So maybe I should assume that it's a non-leap year. Because otherwise, the problem would have to specify. So I think the answer is based on a non-leap year. Therefore, February has 28 days.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that. So January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 25th is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but wait, if I count from January 1st to March 25th, inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if January 1st is day 1, then the number of days between January 1st and March 25th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (March) minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find the number of days from January 1st to March 25th, inclusive, then it's 31 + 28 + 25. But if I want the number of days between January 1st and March 25th, not including January 1st, then it's 31 + 28 + 24. Wait, but the problem is asking for the day of the week of March 25th. So if January 1st is day 0 (Saturday), then March 25th is day X. So the number of days between January 1st and March 25th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (March) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 1 (Saturday), then January 2nd is day 2, etc. So March 25th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (March) days. Wait, but that would be 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. But if January 1st is day 1, then March 25th is day 84. So the number of days between January 1st and March 25th is 84 days. But since the first day is Saturday, then the day of the week would be (84 - 1) days later? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 1 (Saturday), then day 1 is Saturday. Then day 2 is Sunday, day 3 is Monday, etc. So the day of the week for day N is (Saturday + (N-1) days). So for example, day 1 is Saturday, day 2 is Sunday, day 3 is Monday, etc. So to find the day of the week for March 25th, which is day 84, we can calculate (84 - 1) = 83 days after Saturday. Then 83 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder gives the number of days. So 83 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Saturday is... Saturday + 1 day is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday, +5 is Thursday, +6 is Friday. So March 25th would be a Friday? Wait, but that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 25th is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. But if January 1st is day 1, then March 25th is day 84. So the number of days between January 1st and March 25th is 83 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have day 1 as January 1st, then day 2 is January 2nd, and so on. So the number of days between day 1 and day 84 is 83 days. So the total days from January 1st to March 25th is 84 days, but the number of days after January 1st is 83. So the day of the week would be (83) days after Saturday. So 83 divided by 7 is 11*7=77, remainder 6. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. So March 25th is a Friday. But wait, that seems correct? Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Saturday. Let's count the days for each month. January has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Then January 8th is Saturday again, and so on. So January 1st is Saturday, January 2nd is Sunday, ..., January 7th is Friday. Then January 8th is Saturday again. So January has 31 days. So 31 days later. Let's see, 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 1st is Saturday, then January 31st is 3 days after Saturday. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So January 31st is a Tuesday. Then February has 28 days. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28th is also a Tuesday. Then March 1st is Wednesday. Then March 25th is 25 days after March 1st. Let's calculate that. 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So March 1st is Wednesday. Adding 3 weeks (21 days) brings us to March 21st, which is also Wednesday. Then 4 more days: March 22 is Thursday, 23 is Friday, 24 is Saturday, 25 is Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. Wait, according to this, March 25th is Sunday. But earlier calculation said Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, so where is the mistake here? Let me check again. First approach: total days from January 1st to March 25th is 84 days. So 83 days after Saturday. 83 divided by 7 is 11*7=77, remainder 6. 6 days after Saturday is Friday. But the second approach gives Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the mistake is in the first approach. Let me check the second approach again. January 1st is Saturday. January has 31 days. So January 31st is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So January 31st is Tuesday. Then February has 28 days. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28th is also Tuesday. Then March 1st is Wednesday. Then March 25th is 25 days after March 1st. Let's count that. March 1st is Wednesday. March 8th is Wednesday, March 15th is Wednesday, March 22nd is Wednesday. Then March 22nd is Wednesday. Then March 23 is Thursday, 24 is Friday, 25 is Saturday. Wait, that's different. Wait, 25 days after March 1st. Wait, March 1st is day 0. Then March 25th is day 24. Wait, no. Wait, if March 1st is day 0 (Wednesday), then March 25th is 24 days later. Wait, 24 days divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So 3 days after Wednesday is Saturday. So March 25th is Saturday. But that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me re-calculate the total days. January 1st is day 1. Then March 25th is day 84. So the number of days between day 1 and day 84 is 83 days. So 83 days after Saturday. 83 divided by 7 is 11*7=77, remainder 6. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. But according to the second approach, March 25th is Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the way I'm counting the days. Let me check with a specific example. Let's take a known date. For example, if January 1st is Saturday, then January 8th is Saturday again. So January 8th is day 8. Then January 15th is day 15, which is Saturday. Then January 22nd is day 22, Saturday. Then January 29th is day 29, Saturday. Then February 5th is day 31 + 5 = 36? Wait, January has 31 days, so February 1st is day 32. So day 32 is February 1st. Then February 5th is day 36. So day 32 is February 1st (Saturday). Then day 32 + 7 = day 39 is February 8th (Saturday). So February 28th is day 32 + 27 = day 59. 27 days after February 1st. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So February 1st is Saturday, so February 28th is Saturday + 6 days = Friday. Wait, but earlier I thought February 28th was Tuesday. That's conflicting. Wait, this is a problem. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if January 1st is Saturday, then January 31st is day 31. 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So January 31st is Tuesday. Then February 1st is Wednesday. Then February has 28 days. So February 28th is 28 days after February 1st. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28th is Wednesday. So March 1st is Thursday. Wait, but earlier I thought March 1st was Wednesday. That's the mistake. So where did I go wrong before?\n\nAh! In the second approach, I said that February 28th is Tuesday, but that's incorrect. Because if January 31st is Tuesday, then February 1st is Wednesday. Then February 28th is 28 days later. 28 days is 4 weeks, so same day of the week. So February 28th is Wednesday. Therefore, March 1st is Thursday. Then March 25th is 25 days after March 1st. So March 1st is Thursday. Then March 8th is Thursday, March 15th is Thursday, March 22nd is Thursday. Then March 22nd is Thursday. Then March 23 is Friday, 24 is Saturday, 25 is Sunday. So March 25th is Sunday. But according to the first approach, it was Friday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is conflicting. So where is the error in the first approach? Let me check again. The first approach said that the total days from January 1st to March 25th is 84 days. So 84 days. If January 1st is day 1, then March 25th is day 84. So the number of days between day 1 and day 84 is 83 days. So 83 days after Saturday. 83 divided by 7 is 11*7=77, remainder 6. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. But according to the second approach, it's Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the approaches is wrong.\n\nLet me check the total days again. January has 31 days. February has 28 days. March 25th is 25 days. So total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. But if January 1st is day 1, then March 25th is day 84. So the number of days between day 1 and day 84 is 83 days. So 83 days after Saturday. But according to the second approach, March 25th is Sunday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the first approach's calculation of the remainder. Let me check 83 divided by 7. 7*11=77, 83-77=6. So 6 days after Saturday. Saturday + 6 days is Friday. But according to the second approach, it's Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first approach is wrong in assuming that the total days is 84. Let me check again. January 1st is day 1. Then January 31st is day 31. Then February 28th is day 31 + 28 = 59. Then March 25th is day 59 + 25 = 84. So that's correct. So March 25th is day 84. So the number of days from day 1 to day 84 is 83 days. So 83 days after Saturday. But according to the second approach, March 25th is Sunday. So why is there a difference?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the second approach. Let me check again. If January 1st is Saturday, then January 31st is Tuesday. Then February 1st is Wednesday. Then February 28th is Wednesday (since 28 days later"], [99, "Determine the day of the month for the third Thursday in November 2022. Express your answer as a number. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the day of the month for the third Thursday in November 2022. Hmm, first, maybe I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Because once I know that, I can count the Thursdays.\n\nWait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check that. Wait, maybe I should confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I can use some other method. Alternatively, I can look up the calendar for November 2022. But since I can't actually look it up, I need to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then, each subsequent month's first day can be calculated based on the number of days in the previous month. But November is the 11th month. Let me think. Let's see:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So February 1, 2022, would be 31 days after January 1. Since 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So if January 1 was a Sunday, then February 1 would be Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. Then March 1 would be 28 days (February 2022 is not a leap year) after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 would be Wednesday again. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday. May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 would be Saturday + 2 days = Monday. June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So June 1 would be Monday + 3 days = Thursday. July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So July 1 would be Thursday + 2 days = Saturday. August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So August 1 would be Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. September 1 is 31 days after August 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So September 1 would be Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So October 1 would be Friday + 2 days = Sunday. November 1 is 31 days after October 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So November 1 would be Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. Wait, but earlier I thought November 1 was a Tuesday. Hmm, that's conflicting. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check again. Let's start from January 1, 2022, which is a Sunday. Then:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So February 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. That's correct. Then February has 28 days (non-leap year), so March 1 is 28 days later. 28 mod 7 is 0, so March 1 is Wednesday. Then March has 31 days. April 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. April has 30 days. May 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Saturday + 2 days is Monday. May has 31 days. June 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Monday + 3 days is Thursday. June has 30 days. July 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. July has 31 days. August 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. August has 31 days. September 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. September has 30 days. October 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Friday + 2 days is Sunday. October has 31 days. November 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So according to this calculation, November 1, 2022, is a Wednesday. But I thought earlier that it was a Tuesday. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check an actual calendar. Wait, I can't do that, but maybe I can check another way. For example, I know that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if November 1 is Wednesday, then November 4 would be Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should check another date. Let me think. For example, November 7, 2022, was a Monday. If November 1 is Wednesday, then November 7 would be Wednesday + 6 days = Tuesday? Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I need to check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I should use an online source. But since I can't, maybe I need to find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Wait, if November 1 is Wednesday, then November has 30 days. So December 1 is 30 days after November 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. But December 1, 2022, was actually a Thursday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check again. Let's start from January 1, 2022, which is a Sunday. Then:\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\n\nFebruary 1: Sunday + 31 days. 31 / 7 = 4*7=28, remainder 3. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Correct.\n\nFebruary 2022 has 28 days. March 1 is 28 days later. 28 mod 7 is 0. So March 1 is Wednesday. Correct.\n\nMarch 2022 has 31 days. April 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. Correct.\n\nApril 2022 has 30 days. May 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Correct.\n\nMay 2022 has 31 days. June 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Monday + 3 days is Thursday. Correct.\n\nJune 2022 has 30 days. July 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. Correct.\n\nJuly 2022 has 31 days.

Correct.\n\nSeptember 2022 has 30 days. October 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Friday + 2 days is Sunday. Correct.\n\nOctober 2022 has 31 days. November 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. But according to the December 1 being Thursday, that would mean November 1 is Wednesday, and December 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. But December 1, 2022, was actually a Thursday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday is incorrect. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check another way. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So 2022 would be one year before. Since 2022 is not a leap year, 365 days. 365 mod 7 is 1. So January 1, 2023, is 1 day after January 1, 2022. So if January 1, 2023, is Sunday, then January 1, 2022, was Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous assumption. So that's the mistake! I thought January 1, 2022, was a Sunday, but actually it was a Saturday. Because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 started on Saturday. So that changes everything. So my previous calculation was wrong because I assumed January 1, 2022, was Sunday, but it was actually Saturday. So that's the error. Let me start over with that.\n\nSo January 1, 2022, is a Saturday. Then:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. February 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So February 1, 2022, is Tuesday.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. March 1 is 28 days later. 28 mod 7 is 0. So March 1 is Tuesday.\n\nMarch has 31 days. April 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Tuesday + 3 days is Friday.\n\nApril has 30 days. May 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Friday + 2 days is Sunday.\n\nMay has 31 days. June 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday.\n\nJune has 30 days. July 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Wednesday + 2 days is Friday.\n\nJuly has 31 days. August 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Friday + 3 days is Monday.\n\nAugust has 31 days. September 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Monday + 3 days is Thursday.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. October 1 is 30 days later. 30 mod 7 is 2. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday.\n\nOctober has 31 days. November 1 is 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So November 1, 2022, is a Tuesday. That matches my initial thought. Then December 1 is 30 days after November 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Tuesday + 2 days is Thursday. Which matches the actual December 1, 2022, being a Thursday. So that's correct. So November 1 is Tuesday.\n\nSo now, knowing that November 1 is a Tuesday, I can find the Thursdays. Let's list the days of the week for November 2022.\n\nNovember 1 is Tuesday. So:\n\nNovember 1: Tuesday\n\nNovember 2: Wednesday\n\nNovember 3: Thursday (first Thursday)\n\nNovember 4: Friday\n\nNovember 5: Saturday\n\nNovember 6: Sunday\n\nNovember 7: Monday\n\nNovember 8: Tuesday\n\nNovember 9: Wednesday\n\nNovember 10: Thursday (second Thursday)\n\nNovember 11: Friday\n\nNovember 12: Saturday\n\nNovember 13: Sunday\n\nNovember 14: Monday\n\nNovember 15: Tuesday\n\nNovember 16: Wednesday\n\nNovember 17: Thursday (third Thursday)\n\nSo the third Thursday is November 17. Therefore, the answer should be 17. But wait, let me check again. First Thursday is 3rd, second is 10th, third is 17th. Yes. So the third Thursday is the 17th. Therefore, the answer is 17.\n</think>", "17"], [99, "Count the occurrences of Thursday from Sunday, April 3 to Tuesday, June 28, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

First, I should figure out the dates of each Thursday in that range.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way than listing all the dates. Let me think. The total number of days between the start and end dates, then divide by 7 and adjust for the starting day. But I need to make sure that the start and end dates are included.

So the first Thursday in April would be April 7 (since April 3 is Sunday, adding 4 days: 3+4=7). Then each week after that. Let's see how many Thursdays are in April.\n\nApril has 30 days. Let's check the last day of April. April 30. What day is that? If April 3 is Sunday, then April 7 is Thursday. Then April 14, 21, 28. Then April 28 is a Thursday. Then the next one would be May 5. Wait, April 28 is Thursday. Then May 5 is the next Thursday. So in April, there are 4 Thursdays: 7, 14, 21, 28. Wait, April 3 is Sunday, so April 7 is Thursday. Then adding 7 days each time. So 7, 14, 21, 28. That's four Thursdays in April.\n\nNow May. May has 31 days. Let's figure out the first Thursday of May. Since April 28 is Thursday, then May 1 is a Friday. So the first Thursday in May would be May 4 (since May 1 is Friday, so May 2 is Saturday, 3 is Sunday, 4 is Monday? Wait, no. Wait, if April 28 is Thursday, then April 29 is Friday, 30 is Saturday, 31 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, April 3 is Sunday. Then April 4 is Monday, 5 Tuesday, 6 Wednesday, 7 Thursday. Then April 14 is Thursday, 21, 28. Then April 28 is Thursday. Then April 29 is Friday, 30 Saturday, 31 Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. So May 1 is Monday. Therefore, the first Thursday in May would be May 4 (Monday, 2; Tuesday 3; Wednesday 4? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Monday. So May 1 (Monday), 2 (Tuesday), 3 (Wednesday), 4 (Thursday). So yes, May 4 is Thursday. Then the next ones are 11, 18, 25. Then May 31 is a Thursday? Wait, May has 31 days. Let's check. May 4 is Thursday. Then 11, 18, 25. Then the next one would be June 1. So May has 4 Thursdays: 4, 11, 18, 25. Wait, May 25 is Thursday. Then May 31 is a Monday? Wait, May 25 is Thursday. Then May 26 is Friday, 27 Saturday, 28 Sunday, 29 Monday, 30 Tuesday, 31 Wednesday. So May 31 is Wednesday. So the next Thursday is June 1. So in May, there are 4 Thursdays.\n\nNow June. The start date is June 28, which is a Tuesday. Wait, the end date is June 28, which is Tuesday. So the first Thursday in June would be June 8 (since June 1 is a Wednesday? Wait, let me check. Wait, May 31 is Wednesday. Then June 1 is Thursday. Wait, no. Wait, May 31 is Wednesday. Then June 1 is Thursday. So June 1 is Thursday. Then the Thursdays in June would be 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. But the end date is June 28. So June 29 is beyond the end date. So in June, the Thursdays are 1, 8, 15, 22. Then June 29 is after June 28. So that's four Thursdays in June. Wait, but June 28 is Tuesday. So June 28 is Tuesday. So June 29 is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, June 1 is Thursday. Then June 2 is Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, 6 Tuesday, 7 Wednesday, 8 Thursday. So June 8 is Thursday. Then 15, 22, 29. So June 29 is Thursday. But the end date is June 28. So June 28 is Tuesday. So the last Thursday in June is June 29, but that's after the end date. Therefore, in June, the Thursdays are 1, 8, 15, 22. That's four Thursdays. Wait, but June 22 is Thursday. Then June 22 +7 is June 29. So yes, June 22 is within the range (since the end date is June 28). So that's four Thursdays in June.\n\nSo total Thursdays would be April (4) + May (4) + June (4) = 12? Wait, but wait. Wait, the start date is April 3 (Sunday), which is included. So the first Thursday is April 7. Then the last Thursday is June 22. Wait, but June 29 is after June 28. So the total is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12? But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of days between April 3 and June 28, then divide by 7 and adjust. But that might be more complicated. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, April 3 is Sunday. Let's check the dates again. April 3 is Sunday. Then April 7 is Thursday. Then April 14, 21, 28. That's four Thursdays in April. Then May 4, 11, 18, 25. That's four. Then June 1, 8, 15, 22. That's four. So total 12. But wait, June 22 is Thursday. Then June 28 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So 12 Thursdays. But wait, maybe I need to check if the end date is included. The end date is June 28, which is Tuesday. So the last Thursday is June 22. So that's correct. So 12 Thursdays. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days in each month. Let me check again.\n\nApril has 30 days. So April 3 to April 30 is 28 days. Wait, but the start date is April 3. So from April 3 to April 30 is 28 days. But that's 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks. So April 3 is Sunday, then April 3 + 28 days is April 30, which is Sunday again. Wait, but that would mean that April 30 is Sunday. But earlier I thought that April 30 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. So that would make May 4 Thursday. So that's correct. Then May has 31 days. So May 4 is Thursday, then 11, 18, 25. Then May 31 is Wednesday. Then June 1 is Thursday. So June 1 is Thursday. Then June 8, 15, 22, 29. But June 29 is after June 28. So in June, the Thursdays are 1, 8, 15, 22. So that's four. So total 4+4+4=12. But wait, maybe I need to check if the start date is included. The start date is April 3, which is Sunday. So that's included. The end date is June 28, which is Tuesday. So the last Thursday is June 22. So that's correct. So 12 Thursdays. But wait, maybe I should check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of weeks between the two dates. Let's calculate the total number of days between April 3 and June 28, inclusive. Then divide by 7 and adjust for the start and end days.\n\nFirst, April 3 to April 30 is 28 days (since April 3 is day 1, April 4 is day 2, etc. Wait, but if you include both start and end dates, the number of days is (end - start + 1). So April 3 to April 30 is 30 - 3 + 1 = 28 days. Then May has 31 days, and June has 28 days (since June 28 is the end date). Wait, but June 28 is the end date. So total days from April 3 to June 28 is 28 (April) + 31 (May) + 28 (June) = 87 days? Wait, no. Wait, April 3 to April 30 is 28 days. Then May has 31 days, so from May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 28 is 28 days. So total days from April 3 to June 28 is 28 + 31 + 28 = 87 days. Wait, but that's 87 days. Then 87 divided by 7 is 12.428... So that would be 12 weeks and 3 days. So if the start date is Sunday, then the number of Thursdays would be 12 + 1 if the end date is after the 12th week. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, the first day is Sunday (April 3). The first Thursday is 4 days later (April 7). Then each week after that. So the total number of Thursdays would be the number of times the day of the week is Thursday in that period. Since the total days is 87, which is 12 weeks and 3 days. So starting from Sunday, the first Thursday is day 4. Then each week adds 7 days. So the number of Thursdays would be 12 (full weeks) plus 1 if the remaining days include a Thursday. Wait, but the remaining days are 3 days (since 12*7=84, 87-84=3). So the first day is Sunday, then the next 3 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So there's no Thursday in the remaining 3 days. Therefore, the total number of Thursdays would be 12. But that contradicts my previous count of 12. Wait, but according to this, it's 12. But according to my previous count, it's 12. So that's consistent. So the answer is 12?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again. April 3 to April 30 is 28 days. Then May has 31 days, so from May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 28 is 28 days. So total is 28 + 31 + 28 = 87 days. So 87 days. So 87 divided by 7 is 12.428... So 12 weeks and 3 days. So if the first day is Sunday, then the first Thursday is day 4. Then each week after that. So in 12 weeks, there are 12 Thursdays. Then the remaining 3 days (days 85, 86, 87) would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So no additional Thursday. So total 12. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 12.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that there are 4 in each month, 4+4+4=12. So that's correct. So the answer is 12. But wait, maybe I should check with actual dates. Let me try to list them.\n\nApril: 7, 14, 21, 28 (4)\nMay: 4, 11, 18, 25 (4)\nJune: 1, 8, 15, 22 (4)\nTotal 12. Yes. So that's correct. So the answer is 12.\n</think>", "12"], [99, "Between Tuesday, April 12, 2022 and Wednesday, June 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Monday occur? Write the total number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many Mondays there are between Tuesday, April 12, 2022, and Wednesday, June 1, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. Alright, first, maybe I should find out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many weeks there are, which would give me the number of Mondays. But wait, since the start and end dates might not align perfectly with the weeks, I need to check the exact days.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The period starts on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, and ends on Wednesday, June 1, 2022. So I need to count all the days from April 12 to June 1, inclusive. Let me break this down into months. April has 30 days, so from April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, if I include both the start and end dates, then the number of days between April 12 and April 30 inclusive is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days, and then June 1 is one day. So total days would be 19 (April) + 31 (May) + 1 (June) = 51 days? Wait, but wait, April 12 to April 30 is 19 days? Let me check that again. Let's take April 12 as day 1. Then April 13 is day 2, ..., April 30 is day 19. Yes, because 30 - 12 = 18, so adding 1 gives 19 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 19 + 31 = 50 days. Then June 1 is one more day, so total 51 days. So the total number of days is 51.\n\nNow, since there are 51 days, how many weeks are there? 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 2 days. So that would mean 7 full weeks, which is 7 Mondays, plus 2 extra days. But I need to check what those two extra days are. Because depending on which days they fall, the number of Mondays could be 7 + 1 or 7 + 0. So I need to figure out what day of the week April 12, 2022, is, and then count the Mondays.\n\nWait, the problem says that April 12, 2022 is a Tuesday. So the first day of the period is Tuesday. So the first day is Tuesday, April 12. Then the next day is Wednesday, April 13, and so on. So the first day is Tuesday. So the first Monday would be April 11, but that's before the period. Wait, but the period starts on April 12. So the first Monday in the period would be April 18? Let me check. Let's count the days from April 12 (Tuesday). April 12 is Tuesday. Then April 13 is Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday. So the first Monday is April 18. Then the next Mondays would be every 7 days. So April 18, 25, May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, and then June 6, 13, 20, 27. Wait, but the period ends on June 1. So June 1 is Wednesday. So the last Monday would be May 30, which is a Monday. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let's list all the Mondays in the period. Starting from April 18 (Monday). Then adding 7 days: April 25 (Monday). Then May 2 (Monday), May 9, 16, 23, 30. Then June 6, 13, 20, 27. But June 1 is Wednesday, so June 6 is a Monday. But June 6 is after June 1? Wait, June 1 is the end date. So June 6 is after June 1, so it's not included. Therefore, the last Monday in the period is May 30. Let me check May 30. Let's see, May 2 is a Monday. Then May 9, 16, 23, 30. So May 30 is a Monday. Then June 6 would be the next one, but that's beyond June 1. So how many Mondays are there?\n\nFrom April 18, 25, May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 7 Mondays. Wait, that's 7 Mondays. But wait, the total days are 51. 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 2 days. So 7 weeks would have 7 Mondays. Then the two extra days would be the first two days of the period. Wait, but the first day is Tuesday, so the next day is Wednesday. So the two extra days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So those two days don't include any Mondays. Therefore, the total number of Mondays would be 7. But wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier count where I listed 7 Mondays. But maybe that's correct. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again. April 12 to April 30: 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. May has 31 days. June 1 is 1 day. So total 19 + 31 + 1 = 51 days. Correct. So 51 days. 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks (49 days) and 2 days. So 7 weeks would have 7 Mondays. Then the remaining two days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So no additional Mondays. Therefore, total Mondays is 7. But when I listed the Mondays, I found 7 Mondays (April 18, 25, May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30). That's 7. So that seems correct. But wait, maybe I missed one? Let me check again. April 18 is the first Monday. Then adding 7 days: 25, then May 2 (since April 25 + 7 is May 2). Then May 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 7 Mondays. So that's correct. So the answer is 7?\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check the actual dates. Let me check the actual day of the week for May 30, 2022. Wait, but I don't have a calendar here. But since April 12 is a Tuesday, then April 18 is a Monday. Let me check the days. April 12 is Tuesday. Then April 13 is Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday. Correct. Then April 18 is Monday. Then April 25 is next Monday. Then May 2 is Monday. Then May 9, 16, 23, 30. So that's 7 Mondays. Then June 6 would be the next one, but that's after June 1. So yes, 7 Mondays. Therefore, the answer is 7. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again. Let me count the days from April 12 to June 1 inclusive. Let's see:\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 is 1 day. So total 19 + 31 + 1 = 51 days. Correct. So 51 days. 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 2 days. So 7 Mondays. So the answer is 7. But wait, maybe I should check if the first day is Tuesday, so the first day of the period is Tuesday. So the first Monday is 6 days later. Wait, April 12 is Tuesday. So April 18 is Monday (7 days later). So that's correct. Then the next Mondays are every 7 days. So 7 Mondays in total. So the answer is 7. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me check the number of Mondays in each month.\n\nApril: April 12 is Tuesday. So the first Monday in April is April 11 (but that's before the period). The next Monday is April 18. Then April 25. So two Mondays in April (18 and 25). Then May has 31 days. May 2 is Monday, then 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five Mondays. Then June 1 is Wednesday, so June has only one day, which is Wednesday. So total Mondays would be 2 (April) + 5 (May) = 7. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.\n</think>", "7"], [99, "In December 2022, if an event recurs on the second Wednesday, what is the date (day of the month) of the event? Express your answer as a number. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the date of the second Wednesday in December 2022. Let me start by recalling what day December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think about December 2022. Let me try to count the days. If December 1 is a Thursday, then the first Wednesday would be the 7th? Wait, no. Wait, if December 1 is Thursday, then the first Wednesday would be the 7th? Wait, no. Wait, December 1 is Thursday. So the first Wednesday would be the 7th? Wait, no. Wait, December 1 is Thursday. Then the next day, December 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday, 5 is Monday, 6 is Tuesday, 7 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday is the 7th. Then the second Wednesday would be the 14th. Wait, but that would be the second occurrence. So the answer would be 14? But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, if December 1 is Thursday, then December 21 would be 20 days later. Let's count the days. 20 days later. Since 7 days is a week, 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Thursday would be Thursday + 6 days = Wednesday. So that's correct. So December 21 is a Wednesday. Therefore, the first Wednesday is the 7th, the second is the 14th, the third is the 21st, and the fourth is the 28th. So the second Wednesday would be the 14th. Therefore, the answer should be 14. But wait, maybe I need to check if December 2022 actually has 31 days. Yes, December has 31 days. So the second Wednesday is definitely the 14th. So the answer is 14. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me think again. If December 1 is Thursday, then the first Wednesday is the 7th. Then the second is 14th. That seems correct. So the answer is 14. But I need to make sure that December 1, 2022, was indeed a Thursday. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that December 31, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me check that. If December 31 is Saturday, then December 31 minus 7 days is December 24, which would be Saturday as well. Then December 24 is Saturday. Then December 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday. Wait, but earlier I thought that December 21 was Wednesday. Wait, if December 21 is Wednesday, then December 22 is Thursday, 23 is Friday, 24 is Saturday, 25 is Sunday, 26 is Monday, 27 is Tuesday, 28 is Wednesday, 29 is Thursday, 30 is Friday, 31 is Saturday. So that would make December 21 a Wednesday. So if December 21 is Wednesday, then December 1 would be 20 days earlier. 20 days before December 21. Let's count. 20 days before December 21 is December 1. Let me check: 21 - 20 = 1. So December 1 is 20 days before. Since 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So if December 21 is Wednesday, then subtracting 6 days would be Wednesday minus 6 days. Wednesday minus 1 day is Tuesday, minus 2 is Monday, minus 3 is Sunday, minus 4 is Saturday, minus 5 is Friday, minus 6 is Thursday. So December 1 is Thursday. That matches. So that's correct. Therefore, the first Wednesday is the 7th, second is 14th. So the answer is 14. Therefore, the answer should be 14.\n</think>", "14"], [99, "Between Saturday, March 19, 2022 and Sunday, May 8, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)?

Business days are Monday through Friday. So, first, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates and then subtract the weekends.\n\nFirst, let me check the dates. March 19 is a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Wait, March 19, 2022: I think that was a Saturday. Let me check. Well, maybe I can count the days. But maybe I should just proceed step by step.\n\nSo the period starts on March 19, 2022 (Saturday) and ends on May 8, 2022 (Sunday). The question says to count both dates. So I need to include both start and end dates.\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of days between March 19 and May 8, inclusive. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week.\n\nLet me first figure out the total number of days between the two dates. Let's break it down month by month.\n\nMarch 19 to March 31: March has 31 days. So from March 19 to March 31 inclusive. Let's calculate that. March 19 is day 1. March 31 is day 13 (since 31 - 19 + 1 = 13 days). Wait, 31 - 19 = 12, so adding 1 gives 13 days. So that's 13 days in March.\n\nThen April has 30 days. So April 1 to April 30 is 30 days.\n\nThen May 1 to May 8 is 8 days.\n\nSo total days from March 19 to May 8 inclusive is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. Wait, but wait, let me check again. Wait, March 19 to March 31 is 13 days. Then April is 30 days. Then May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. But wait, is that correct? Let me check another way. Let's take March 19 as day 1. Then March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13. Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days would take us to May 1 (day 13 + 30 = day 43). Then May 1 is day 43, May 2 is 44, ..., May 8 is day 43 + 7 = day 50? Wait, that's conflicting with the previous total. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, if March 19 is day 1, then March 19 + 1 day is March 20 (day 2), and so on. So March 19 to March 31 is 13 days. Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days would take us to May 1 (day 13 + 30 = day 43). Then May 1 is day 43. Then May 8 is 8 days after May 1, so day 43 + 7 = day 50. Wait, but that would mean that the total days from March 19 to May 8 inclusive is 50 days? But earlier I thought 13 + 30 + 8 = 51. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in how I count the days. Let me think again. If March 19 is day 1, then March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13. Then April 1 is day 14. April has 30 days, so April 30 is day 14 + 29 = day 43. Then May 1 is day 44. Then May 8 is day 44 + 7 = day 51. Wait, that's 51 days. So why the previous calculation said 50? Because when I added 13 (March) + 30 (April) + 8 (May) = 51. But when I thought of May 1 as day 43, then adding 8 days would be day 51. So that's correct. So the total number of days is 51. So that's correct. So the total days between March 19 and May 8 inclusive is 51 days.\n\nNow, I need to subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period. So how many weekends are there?\n\nFirst, let's figure out the days of the week for the start and end dates. March 19, 2022 is a Saturday. So March 19 is Saturday. Then March 20 is Sunday, March 21 is Monday, and so on.\n\nSo the first day is Saturday. Let's list the days of the week for each date.\n\nMarch 19: Saturday (day 1)\nMarch 20: Sunday (day 2)\nMarch 21: Monday (day 3)\nMarch 22: Tuesday (day 4)\nMarch 23: Wednesday (day 5)\nMarch 24: Thursday (day 6)\nMarch 25: Friday (day 7)\nMarch 26: Saturday (day 8)\nMarch 27: Sunday (day 9)\nMarch 28: Monday (day 10)\nMarch 29: Tuesday (day 11)\nMarch 30: Wednesday (day 12)\nMarch 31: Thursday (day 13)\n\nSo March has 13 days. Now, the weekends in March are Saturday (day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29) and Sunday (day 2, 9, 16, 23, 30). Wait, but March 19 is day 1 (Saturday), so March 26 is day 8 (Saturday), March 26 is Saturday. Then March 27 is Sunday (day 9). Then March 31 is Thursday (day 13). So in March, the weekends are:\n\nSaturdays: March 19, 26 (days 1 and 8)\nSundays: March 20, 27 (days 2 and 9)\nWait, but March 19 is day 1 (Saturday), March 20 is day 2 (Sunday), March 21 is day 3 (Monday), March 22 is day 4 (Tuesday), March 23 is day 5 (Wednesday), March 24 is day 6 (Thursday), March 25 is day 7 (Friday), March 26 is day 8 (Saturday), March 27 is day 9 (Sunday), March 28 is day 10 (Monday), March 29 is day 11 (Tuesday), March 30 is day 12 (Wednesday), March 31 is day 13 (Thursday). So in March, the weekends are:\n\nSaturdays: March 19 (day 1), March 26 (day 8)\nSundays: March 20 (day 2), March 27 (day 9)\nSo that's 2 Saturdays and 2 Sundays in March. Wait, but March has 13 days. So that's 2 Saturdays and 2 Sundays, which is 4 weekend days. Wait, but March 19 is Saturday, March 20 is Sunday, March 26 is Saturday, March 27 is Sunday. Then March 31 is Thursday. So that's 2 Saturdays and 2 Sundays in March. So 4 weekend days in March.\n\nThen April. April 1 is day 14 (Monday). Let's check. March 31 is day 13 (Thursday). Then April 1 is day 14 (Friday? Wait, no. Wait, March 31 is Thursday (day 13). Then April 1 is Friday (day 14). Wait, but earlier I thought that March 19 is Saturday (day 1), March 20 is Sunday (day 2), March 21 is Monday (day 3), March 22 is Tuesday (day 4), March 23 is Wednesday (day 5), March 24 is Thursday (day 6), March 25 is Friday (day 7), March 26 is Saturday (day 8), March 27 is Sunday (day 9), March 28 is Monday (day 10), March 29 is Tuesday (day 11), March 30 is Wednesday (day 12), March 31 is Thursday (day 13). So April 1 is Friday (day 14). So April 1 is Friday. Then April 2 is Saturday (day 15), April 3 is Sunday (day 16), April 4 is Monday (day 17), and so on.\n\nSo April has 30 days. Let's count the number of weekends in April. Since April 1 is Friday, the first weekend is April 2 (Saturday) and April 3 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is April 9 (Saturday) and April 10 (Sunday), then April 16, 17, April 23, 24, April 30, 31? Wait, April has 30 days. So April 30 is the last day. Let's check:\n\nApril 1: Friday (day 14)\nApril 2: Saturday (day 15)\nApril 3: Sunday (day 16)\nApril 4: Monday (day 17)\nApril 5: Tuesday (day 18)\nApril 6: Wednesday (day 19)\nApril 7: Thursday (day 20)\nApril 8: Friday (day 21)\nApril 9: Saturday (day 22)\nApril 10: Sunday (day 23)\nApril 11: Monday (day 24)\nApril 12: Tuesday (day 25)\nApril 13: Wednesday (day 26)\nApril 14: Thursday (day 27)\nApril 15: Friday (day 28)\nApril 16: Saturday (day 29)\nApril 17: Sunday (day 30)\nApril 18: Monday (day 31)\nApril 19: Tuesday (day 32)\nApril 20: Wednesday (day 33)\nApril 21: Thursday (day 34)\nApril 22: Friday (day 35)\nApril 23: Saturday (day 36)\nApril 24: Sunday (day 37)\nApril 25: Monday (day 38)\nApril 26: Tuesday (day 39)\nApril 27: Wednesday (day 40)\nApril 28: Thursday (day 41)\nApril 29: Friday (day 42)\nApril 30: Saturday (day 43)\n\nWait, so April 30 is Saturday (day 43). So in April, the weekends are:\n\nApril 2 (Saturday), April 3 (Sunday)\nApril 9 (Saturday), April 10 (Sunday)\nApril 16 (Saturday), April 17 (Sunday)\nApril 23 (Saturday), April 24 (Sunday)\nApril 30 (Saturday), April 31 (Sunday) \u2014 but April only has 30 days. So April 30 is Saturday (day 43). So the last weekend in April is April 30 (Saturday) and April 31 (Sunday) \u2014 but April 31 doesn't exist. So only April 30 is Saturday. So that's 5 Saturdays and 4 Sundays? Wait, let me recount.\n\nLooking at the days:\n\nApril 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun)\nApril 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun)\nApril 16 (Sat), 17 (Sun)\nApril 23 (Sat), 24 (Sun)\nApril 30 (Sat), 31 (Sun) \u2014 but April 31 is not there. So in April, the weekends are:\n\nSaturdays: April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5 Saturdays)\nSundays: April 3, 10, 17, 24 (4 Sundays)\nSo total of 5 + 4 = 9 weekend days in April.\n\nWait, but April has 30 days. Let me check the count again. From April 2 to April 30, how many Saturdays and Sundays are there?\n\nApril 2 is Saturday (1), April 9 (2), April 16 (3), April 23 (4), April 30 (5). That's 5 Saturdays. Sundays are April 3 (1), 10 (2), 17 (3), 24 (4). So 4 Sundays. So total 9 weekend days in April.\n\nThen May. May 1 is day 44 (Monday). Let's check. April 30 is day 43 (Saturday). Then May 1 is day 44 (Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, April 30 is Saturday (day 43). Then May 1 is Sunday (day 44). Wait, but earlier I thought that April 1 is Friday (day 14), so April 30 is Saturday (day 43). Then May 1 is Sunday (day 44). Then May 2 is Monday (day 45), and so on. So May 1 is Sunday. The period ends on May 8, which is day 51. So May 1 is Sunday (day 44), May 2 is Monday (45), May 3 is Tuesday (46), May 4 is Wednesday (47), May 5 is Thursday (48), May 6 is Friday (49), May 7 is Saturday (50), May 8 is Sunday (51). So in May, the weekends are May 1 (Sunday), May 7 (Saturday), and May 8 (Sunday). Wait, but May 8 is the end date. So in May, the weekends are:\n\nSundays: May 1 (day 44), May 8 (day 51)\nSaturdays: May 7 (day 50)\nSo that's 2 Sundays and 1 Saturday. So total 3 weekend days in May.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period:\n\nMarch: 4 (2 Saturdays and 2 Sundays)\nApril: 9 (5 Saturdays and 4 Sundays)\nMay: 3 (1 Saturday and 2 Sundays)\nTotal weekends: 4 + 9 + 3 = 16 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. March had 2 Saturdays and 2 Sundays (4 days). April had 5 Saturdays and 4 Sundays (9 days). May had 1 Saturday and 2 Sundays (3 days). So total 4 + 9 + 3 = 16 weekend days. So total days is 51, so business days would be 51 - 16 = 35 days. But wait, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check again.\n\nMarch: 4 weekend days (2 Sat, 2 Sun)\nApril: 5 Sat and 4 Sun, total 9\nMay: 1 Sat and 2 Sun, total 3\nTotal 4 + 9 + 3 = 16. So 51 - 16 = 35 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from March 19 (Saturday) which is not a business day. So March 19 is Saturday, so not counted. March 20 is Sunday, also not counted. March 21 is Monday (business day). March 22 is Tuesday (business). March 23 is Wednesday. March 24 is Thursday. March 25 is Friday. March 26 is Saturday. March 27 is Sunday. March 28 is Monday. March 29 is Tuesday. March 30 is Wednesday. March 31 is Thursday. So in March, the business days are from March 21 to March 25 (5 days), March 28 to March 31 (4 days). That's 5 + 4 = 9 business days in March.\n\nWait, March 21 (Mon) to March 25 (Fri) is 5 days. Then March 28 (Mon) to March 31 (Thu) is 4 days. So 9 business days in March. But according to the previous calculation, total days in March is 13, and weekends are 4, so business days would be 13 - 4 = 9. Correct. So that's 9.\n\nApril: April 1 is Friday (day 14). So April 1 is Friday (business day). April 2 is Saturday (non-business). April 3 is Sunday (non-business). April 4 is Monday (business). So in April, the business days would be from April 1 to April 30, excluding weekends. Let's count the number of business days in April. Since April has 30 days, and there are 9 weekend days (as calculated before), so 30 - 9 = 21 business days. Wait, but let me check again. Wait, April 1 is Friday (business), April 2 is Saturday (non), April 3 is Sunday (non), April 4 is Monday (business). So the first week of April has 3 business days (Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu?"], [99, "Determine if the year 2043 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2043 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2043 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2043 divided by 4. 4 times 510 is 2040, so 2043 minus 2040 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 2043 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check the rules to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nThe rules are: 1) divisible by 4, 2) if divisible by 100, must also be divisible by 400. So, if a year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year. But if it's divisible by 100 but not by 400, it's not. But 2043 isn't even divisible by 100. Let me confirm: 2043 divided by 100 is 20.43, so no, it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition doesn't apply here. Since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. So the answer should be No.\n</think>", "No"], [99, "Count the occurrences of Monday from Friday, August 5 to Monday, August 29, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

First, I should figure out what day of the week August 5, 2022, is. Wait, the problem says the start date is Monday, August 5. Wait, no, the start date is August 5, and the end date is August 29. Wait, the question says \"from Monday, August 5 to Monday, August 29\". Wait, but the start date is August 5, which is a Monday, and the end date is August 29, which is also a Monday. So the period includes both dates.\n\nSo the task is to count all the Mondays between these two dates, inclusive. Let me think. Let me first confirm the days of the week for these dates. Wait, but maybe I can just calculate the number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but since the start and end are both Mondays, maybe it's straightforward.\n\nWait, August 5 is a Monday. Then August 12 is the next Monday, then 19, 26. Then August 26 is a Monday. Then the next one would be September 2, but that's outside the range. Wait, the end date is August 29. So August 29 is a Monday? Let me check. Wait, August 5 is a Monday. Let me count the days. Let's see:\n\nAugust 5: Monday\n\nAugust 12: Monday (7 days later)\n\nAugust 19: Monday\n\nAugust 26: Monday\n\nThen August 26 + 7 days is September 2. So August 29 is 3 days after August 26. So August 26 is Monday, then August 27 is Tuesday, August 28 is Wednesday, August 29 is Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting with the problem statement. Wait the problem says the end date is Monday, August 29. But according to this, August 29 is a Thursday. That can't be right. So maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual calendar for 2022. Let me think. Wait, August 5, 2022, was a Friday? Wait, no, the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5. Wait, maybe the problem is correct, but I need to check. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the actual days. Let me think. Let me check the day of the week for August 5, 2022. Let me recall that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, I can use some known dates. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Let me check that. Wait, July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then July 8, 15, 22, 29 are Fridays. Then August 5 is 22 days after July 29. July has 31 days, so July 29 is Friday. Then July 30 is Saturday, July 31 is Sunday. August 1 is Monday. Then August 5 is 4 days after August 1. So August 1 is Monday, so August 5 is Friday. Wait, that's conflicting with the problem's statement that August 5 is a Monday. Wait, that can't be. So there's a problem here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for July 1, 2022. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to calculate. Let me think again. Let me check the day of the week for August 5, 2022. Let's take a known date. For example, August 1, 2022, was a Monday. Wait, if that's the case, then August 5 would be Friday. But the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5. So that's conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check again. Let me think. Let me check the day of the week for August 5, 2022. Let me use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me count the days from January 1 to August 5. January has 31 days, February 28 (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, and then August 5. So total days from January 1 to August 5 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 5 (Aug) = Let's calculate that:\n\n31 + 28 = 59\n\n59 + 31 = 90\n\n90 + 30 = 120\n\n120 + 31 = 151\n\n151 + 30 = 181\n\n181 + 31 = 212\n\n212 + 5 = 217 days.\n\nSo January 1, 2022, is a Saturday. Then 217 days later is August 5. Let's find the day of the week. Since 217 divided by 7 is 31 weeks and 0 days. So 217 days later is the same day of the week. So January 1 is Saturday, so August 5 is also a Saturday? But that contradicts the problem's statement that August 5 is a Monday. Therefore, there's a problem here. Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\n\nFebruary: 28 (2022 is not a leap year)\n\nMarch: 31\n\nApril: 30\n\nMay: 31\n\nJune: 30\n\nJuly: 31\n\nAugust: 5 (up to August 5)\n\nSo total days from January 1 to August 5 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 5. Wait, no. Wait, from January 1 to August 5 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 5 (Aug) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if you count from January 1 to August 5 inclusive, that's 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 5 days? Wait, no. Wait, the total number of days from January 1 to August 5 is the sum of the days in each month up to July, plus 5 days in August. Wait, but if you start on January 1, then the next day is January 2, so the number of days between January 1 and August 5 is 217 days. Wait, but if January 1 is day 0, then August 5 is day 217. But since 217 divided by 7 is 31 weeks and 0 days, so the day of the week would be the same as January 1, which is Saturday. Therefore, August 5 is a Saturday. But the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let me count the days from January 1 to August 5.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90. April has 30 days, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120. May has 31 days, so up to May 31 is 120 + 31 = 151. June has 30 days, so up to June 30 is 151 + 30 = 181. July has 31 days, so up to July 31 is 181 + 31 = 212. Then August 5 is 212 + 5 = 217 days. So that's correct. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then August 5 is also a Saturday. Therefore, the problem's statement that August 5 is a Monday must be wrong. But the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So maybe the problem is incorrect? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the day of the week for January 1, 2022?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual day of the week for January 1, 2022. Let me think. I remember that January 1, 2020, was a Wednesday. Then 2020 is a leap year, so 2020 has 366 days. 2021 is 365 days, and 2022 is 365 days. So from 2020 to 2021, 366 days later. Let me check. January 1, 2020: Wednesday. Then 2020 has 366 days, so January 1, 2021, is 366 days later. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. So January 1, 2021, is a Friday. Then 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022, is Friday + 1 day = Saturday. So that's correct. Therefore, January 1, 2022, is a Saturday. Therefore, August 5 is a Saturday. Therefore, the problem's start date is incorrect. But the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5. Therefore, there's a mistake here. But since the problem is given, maybe I need to proceed with the assumption that August 5 is a Monday. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach. Let me check the day of the week for August 5, 2022, using another method. For example, I know that August 1, 2022, was a Monday. Wait, if that's the case, then August 5 would be Friday. But if August 1 is Monday, then August 5 is Friday. But the problem says August 5 is Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, maybe the problem is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about August 1 being a Monday. Let me check. Let me think about the day of the week for August 1, 2022. If I can find that, then I can check August 5.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Let me check that. If July 1 is Friday, then July 8 is Friday, July 15, 22, 29. Then August 5 is 6 days after July 29. July 29 is Friday, so July 30 is Saturday, July 31 is Sunday, August 1 is Monday, August 2 is Tuesday, August 3 is Wednesday, August 4 is Thursday, August 5 is Friday. So that's correct. Therefore, August 5 is a Friday. Therefore, the problem's statement that August 5 is a Monday is incorrect. Therefore, there's a mistake in the problem. But since the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5, maybe I need to proceed with that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I'm miscalculating. Let me check another way. Let me check the day of the week for August 5, 2022, using an online source. Wait, but since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my knowledge. Alternatively, I can use the fact that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Therefore, the problem's start date is incorrect. But since the problem says it's a Monday, maybe I need to proceed with that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to adjust my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and the dates are from Monday, August 5 to Monday, August 29. So even if August 5 is a Friday, but the problem says it's a Monday, then the dates are from Monday, August 5 to Monday, August 29. So regardless of the actual day, the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5. Therefore, I need to proceed with that. So maybe the problem is correct, and I need to count the Mondays between those dates, assuming that August 5 is a Monday and August 29 is a Monday. So even if in reality that's not the case, the problem says that. Therefore, I need to proceed with that.\n\nSo if August 5 is a Monday, then the Mondays in the period would be August 5, 12, 19, 26. Then August 26 is a Monday. Then the next one is September 2, which is outside the range. But the end date is August 29, which is a Monday. Wait, but if August 26 is a Monday, then August 29 is three days later, which would be Thursday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there's a problem here. Therefore, the problem must have a mistake. But since the problem says that the end date is Monday, August 29, then perhaps the start date is not August 5, but another date. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to find the number of Mondays between August 5 and August 29, inclusive, regardless of the actual days. Wait, but the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5, and the end date is Monday, August 29. So the period is from Monday to Monday, which is 25 days (from August 5 to August 29 inclusive). Let me check the number of days between August 5 and August 29. August 5 to August 29 is 25 days (29 -5 = 24 days, plus 1 for inclusive, so 25 days). So 25 days. Now, if the first day is Monday, then the Mondays would be on day 1 (August 5), day 8 (August 12), day 15 (August 19), day 22 (August 26), and day 29 (August 29). Wait, but August 26 is day 22, then day 29 is 22 + 7 = 29. So that would be 4 Mondays. But wait, August 29 is the 25th day. So day 22 is August 26, day 29 is August 29. So that's 4 Mondays. But wait, 25 days total. So 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So there are 4 Mondays. Therefore, the answer is 4. But wait, if the start date is Monday, then the Mondays would be on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th. But if the end date is August 29, which is the 25th day, then the 29th day is the 29th day. Wait, but August 5 is day 1, then August 12 is day 8, August 19 is day 15, August 26 is day 22, and August 29 is day 25. So that's 4 Mondays. Therefore, the answer is 4. But according to the actual calendar, August 5 is a Friday, so the problem's start date is incorrect. But since the problem says that the start date is Monday, August 5, then the answer is 4. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n</think>", "4"], [99, "Determine if the year 1950 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1950 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1950 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1950 divided by 4. 4 times 487 is 1948, so 1950 minus 1948 is 2. That leaves a remainder of 2, so 1950 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check. Let me add the digits: 1+9+5+0=15. Wait, that's for divisibility by 3, not 4. Maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, 1950 divided by 2 is 975, so it's even. But for divisibility by 4, the last two digits should form a number divisible by 4. The last two digits of 1950 are 50. 50 divided by 4 is 12.5, which isn't an integer. So yes, 50 isn't divisible by 4, so 1950 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, it's not a leap year. \n\nBut wait, what about century years? Well, 1950 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. Century years are like 1600, 1700, 1800, 2000, etc. Since 1950 divided by 100 is 19.5, it's not a century year. So the second condition (divisible by 400) doesn't apply here. So the only rule that matters here is the first one: divisible by 4. Since 1950 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. \n\nI think that's all. So the answer should be No.\n</think>", "No"], [99, "Name the day of the week for 05/16/2022. Name the day of the week in full.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week May 16, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that sometimes you can use known dates to calculate this. For example, if I know that a certain date is a specific day, I can count the days forward or backward to find another date.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that are weekends. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then maybe I can count the days from there. But wait, I'm not sure if that's right. Maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know some other dates. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. July 4, 2022, I think was a Monday. If that's true, then maybe I can count backwards or forwards from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 16 is a certain number of days away from a known date. Let me try to find a reference point. Let's see, if I take July 4, 2022, which I think is a Monday. Let's check the number of days between May 16 and July 4. May has 31 days, so from May 16 to May 31 is 15 days (since 31-16=15, but including May 16? Wait, no. If I'm going from May 16 to May 31, that's 15 days later. Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days, and then July 4 is 4 days. So total days from May 16 to July 4 is 15 + 30 + 4 = 49 days. Wait, but if July 4 is a Monday, then May 16 would be 49 days before that. Since 49 days is exactly 7 weeks (49 divided by 7 is 7), so that would mean that May 16 is also a Monday. But wait, that can't be right because if July 4 is a Monday, then subtracting 49 days would be the same day of the week. But that would mean May 16 is a Monday. But I'm not sure if July 4 is actually a Monday. Maybe I need to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. Let me think. I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If May 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then May 16 would be 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Sunday would be Monday. So that would make May 16 a Monday. But I need to confirm if May 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday. How can I check that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then I can count the days up to May 1. Let's see. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Saturday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so February 1 is a Monday (since 31 days later, 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday? Wait, wait. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Saturday. Wait, maybe I should count the days step by step. Let me try again.\n\nJanuary 1, 2022: Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, and so on. January has 31 days. So January 31 is 31 days after January 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 1 is Saturday, so January 31 is Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. Wait, that would mean that February 1 is Wednesday. Then February has 28 days. So February 28 is 28 days after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28 is also a Wednesday. Then March 1 is Thursday. March has 31 days. So March 1 is Thursday. March 31 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 31 is Thursday + 3 days = Sunday. Then April 1 is Monday. April has 30 days. So April 30 is 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 30 is Monday + 2 days = Wednesday. Then May 1 is Thursday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought that May 1 was a Sunday. So according to this calculation, May 1, 2022 is a Thursday. But that would mean that May 16 is 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Thursday + 1 day is Friday. So May 16 would be a Friday. But that contradicts the earlier thought that May 16 was a Monday. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a contradiction here. So I must have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check again. Let's start from January 1, 2022 as Saturday. Then January 1 is Saturday. January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Saturday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days after February 1. Since February 1 is a Wednesday (as January 31 is Tuesday, so February 1 is Wednesday). Then February 28 is 28 days later, which is exactly 4 weeks, so same day of the week. So February 28 is Wednesday. Then March 1 is Thursday. March has 31 days. March 1 is Thursday. March 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. Then April 5 is Thursday. April has 30 days. April 1 is Monday (since March 31 is Sunday, so April 1 is Monday). Wait, March 31 is Sunday. So April 1 is Monday. Then April 30 is 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 1 is Monday, April 30 is Monday + 2 days = Wednesday. Then May 1 is Thursday. So that's correct. So May 1 is Thursday. Then May 16 is 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Thursday + 1 day is Friday. Therefore, May 16, 2022 is a Friday. But earlier, I thought that July 4 was a Monday. Let me check that again. If May 1 is Thursday, then May 16 is Friday. Then May 23 is Friday, June 6 is Friday, June 13 is Friday, June 20 is Friday, June 27 is Friday, July 4 is Friday. Wait, that would mean July 4 is a Friday. But I thought earlier that July 4 was a Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial assumption about July 4 being a Monday. So perhaps that was wrong. Therefore, the correct day for May 16 is Friday. But how can I confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that May 20, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if May 16 is Friday, then May 20 is Friday as well. Wait, but that's 4 days later. Wait, May 16 is Friday, then May 17 is Saturday, 18 Sunday, 19 Monday, 20 Tuesday. Wait, that would make May 20 a Tuesday. So that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. If May 1 is Thursday, then May 1 + 7 days is May 8 (Thursday), May 15 (Thursday), May 16 is Friday. Then May 16 is Friday. Then May 17 is Saturday, 18 Sunday, 19 Monday, 20 Tuesday. So May 20 is Tuesday. But I think that May 20, 2022 was actually a Friday. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check an actual calendar. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check the number of days from a known date. For example, if I know that May 16 is Friday, then July 4 is 49 days later. 49 days is 7 weeks, so same day. So July 4 would be Friday. But I thought earlier that July 4 was a Monday. So that must have been wrong. Therefore, if May 16 is Friday, then July 4 is Friday. But I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if May 1 is Thursday, then May 8 is Thursday, May 15 is Thursday, May 16 is Friday. Then May 15 is Thursday, so May 16 is Friday. Then June 1 is 16 days after May 16. 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Friday + 2 days is Sunday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous thought that June 1 is Wednesday. So that's a problem. Therefore, there's a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again. If May 1 is Thursday, then May 1 + 1 day is May 2 (Friday), May 3 (Saturday), May 4 (Sunday), May 5 (Monday), May 6 (Tuesday), May 7 (Wednesday), May 8 (Thursday). So that's correct. Then May 15 is Thursday. May 16 is Friday. Then May 16 to June 1 is 16 days. Wait, May 16 to May 31 is 15 days (since May 16 + 15 days is May 31). Then June 1 is 16 days after May 16. So 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day, so May 31 is Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Then June 1 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. Wait, but that would mean June 1 is Sunday. But earlier I thought that June 1 was Wednesday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Maybe that's wrong. Let me check that again. How can I verify January 1, 2022? Well, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Saturday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days after February 1. February 1 is Wednesday (since January 31 is Tuesday, so February 1 is Wednesday). Then February 28 is Wednesday. March 1 is Thursday. March has 31 days. March 1 is Thursday. March 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. April 5 is Thursday. April has 30 days. April 1 is Monday (since March 31 is Sunday, so April 1 is Monday). Then April 30 is 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 1 is Monday, April 30 is Monday + 2 days = Wednesday. Then May 1 is Thursday. So that's correct. Then May 1 is Thursday. Then May 16 is 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Thursday + 1 day is Friday. So May 16 is Friday. Then May 16 is Friday. Then May 23 is Friday. Then June 6 is Friday. June 13 is Friday. June 20 is Friday. June 27 is Friday. July 4 is Friday. So July 4 is Friday. But I thought earlier that July 4 was a Monday. So that must have been wrong. Therefore, according to this calculation, May 16 is Friday. But I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check the number of days from May 16 to a known date. For example, if I know that May 16 is Friday, then May 20 is Tuesday. Wait, May 16 is Friday, May 17 is Saturday, 18 Sunday, 19 Monday, 20 Tuesday. So May 20 is Tuesday. Then May 20 is Tuesday. Then May 27 is Tuesday. Then June 3 is Tuesday. June 10 is Tuesday. June 17 is Tuesday. June 24 is Tuesday. July 1 is Tuesday. July 4 is Friday. Wait, that's conflicting. Because from July 1 (Tuesday) to July 4 is 3 days. So July 1 is Tuesday, July 2 is Wednesday, July 3 is Thursday, July 4 is Friday. So that's correct. So July 4 is Friday. Therefore, if May 16 is Friday, then July 4 is Friday. So that's correct. Therefore, May 16 is Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But I need to make sure that my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 being Saturday is correct. Since January 1, 2021 was a Friday, and 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days later is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 starts on Saturday. That's correct. Therefore, the calculation seems correct. So May 16, 2022 is a Friday.\n</think>", "Friday"], [99, "On which weekday did April 5, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week April 5, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. Maybe I can use Zeller's Congruence or some other algorithm. Alternatively, I could use known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should check that. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that April 5, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about the days in April. April has 30 days. Let me think about the days of the week for April 1, 2022. If I can find that, then I can count forward.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, no, I need to verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me think. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Yes, that's right. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday.\n\nNow, let's count the days from January 1 to April 5. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then, February has 28 days in 2022 (since it's not a leap year). March has 31 days. Then April 5 is the 5th day of April.\n\nSo, from January 1 to April 5, how many days is that?\n\nJanuary: 31 days. February: 28 days. March: 31 days. April 5: 5 days. So total days from January 1 to April 5 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 5 = 95 days. Wait, but wait, if I start counting from January 1, then January 1 is day 1. So adding up the days:\n\nJanuary 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. March 1 to March 31 is 31 days. Then April 1 to April 5 is 5 days. So total days from January 1 to April 5 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 5 = 95 days. But since January 1 is day 1, then April 5 is 95 days after January 1. Wait, but if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 95 days to that date would give me the day of the week.\n\nBut how do I calculate that? Since each week has 7 days, I can take 95 divided by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the date is from the starting day.\n\nSo 95 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 4 days (since 13*7=91, 95-91=4). So 4 days ahead of Saturday. Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday? Wait, Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday. So April 5, 2022 would be a Wednesday? But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March has 31 days, adding 31. Then April 5 is 5 days. So total is 31 + 28 + 31 + 5 = 95. That's correct. So 95 days from January 1, 2022. Since January 1 is a Saturday, adding 95 days. 95 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 4. So 4 days after Saturday is Wednesday. So April 5 would be a Wednesday. But wait, I think I might be wrong here. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then April 5 would be 4 days later, which would be Tuesday. But that contradicts the previous answer. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual day. Wait, I think I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to rely on calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, April 1, 2022. Let's see. If January 1 is Saturday, then let's count the days from January 1 to April 1.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28 days, March 31 days. So April 1 is 31 + 28 + 31 = 90 days after January 1. 90 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. So April 1, 2022 is a Friday. Then April 5 is 4 days after that, which would be Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. So which is correct?\n\nWait, in the first calculation, I had 95 days from January 1 to April 5. But if April 1 is 90 days, then April 5 is 90 + 4 = 94 days. Wait, that's different from the previous 95. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 1 is day 1. Then January 2 is day 2, etc. So the number of days from January 1 to April 5 inclusive is 95 days. But if I'm calculating the number of days between January 1 and April 5, then if I want to find the day of the week, I need to consider that January 1 is day 1 (Saturday). Then adding 94 days would get me to April 5. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nIf I have a date that is N days after January 1, then the day of the week is (starting day + N) mod 7. But if January 1 is day 0, then adding N days would be (0 + N) mod 7. But if January 1 is day 1, then adding N days would be (1 + N) mod 7. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take a concrete example. If January 1 is a Saturday (day 0), then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday (day 1). So if I have a date that is X days after January 1, then the day of the week is (Saturday + X) mod 7. But if I count the days from January 1 to April 5, how many days is that?\n\nIf January 1 is day 0, then April 5 is day 94 (since from January 1 to April 5 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 5 (Apr) - 1 = 31 + 28 + 31 + 4 = 94? Wait, no. Wait, if you count the number of days between January 1 and April 5 inclusive, it's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 5 (Apr) = 95 days. But if you want the number of days after January 1, then April 5 is 94 days after January 1. Because January 1 is day 0, then day 1 is January 2, etc. So if you have 94 days after January 1, that would be April 5. So the total days after January 1 is 94. So 94 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 3. So 3 days after Saturday. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday. But earlier, when I calculated April 1 as 90 days after January 1, which would be 90 days. 90 divided by 7 is 12*7=84, remainder 6. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. Then April 1 is Friday. Then April 5 is 4 days later, which is Tuesday. So that matches. So that would mean that April 5 is Tuesday. But earlier, when I thought that April 5 was 95 days after January 1, which would be 95 mod 7 = 95 - 13*7=95-91=4. So 4 days after Saturday is Wednesday. But that's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! The confusion is whether the number of days after January 1 is 94 or 95. If January 1 is day 0, then April 5 is 94 days after. If January 1 is day 1, then April 5 is 95 days after. So the key is whether we count the starting day as day 0 or day 1. So if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 94 days would be 94 mod 7 = 94 /7 is 13*7=91, remainder 3. So 3 days after Saturday is Tuesday. But if I count 95 days, then 95 mod 7 is 4, which would be Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nLet me check with April 1. If April 1 is 90 days after January 1. If January 1 is day 0, then April 1 is day 90. 90 mod 7 is 90 - 12*7=90-84=6. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. Which matches the previous calculation. So April 1 is Friday. Then April 5 is 4 days later, which is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the correct answer should be Tuesday. But why did the first calculation give me Wednesday? Because I was counting 95 days from January 1, but that would be if January 1 is day 1. So if I have 95 days from January 1 (including January 1), then the number of days after January 1 is 94. So the correct way is to take the number of days between January 1 and April 5, which is 95 days, but the number of days after January 1 is 94. Therefore, 94 mod 7 is 3, which is Tuesday. So the correct answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm this. Let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, April 1, 2022 is Friday. Then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday, April 4 is Monday, April 5 is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday. So why did the first calculation give me Wednesday? Because I was adding 95 days, which is incorrect. The correct number of days after January 1 is 94. So the remainder is 3, which is Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that January 1, 2022 was indeed a Saturday. Let me check that again. I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2021 ends on a Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. That's correct. So that's the starting point. Then April 1 is 90 days later. 90 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 6 days. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. So April 1 is Friday. Then April 5 is 4 days later, which is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that the first calculation gave me Wednesday, but that was due to a miscalculation of the number of days. So the correct answer is Tuesday. Therefore, April 5, 2022 was a Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [99, "Determine the day of the month for the fourth Wednesday in November 2022.

So the number of days between January 1 and November 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) = let's calculate that.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nJanuary: 31\n\nFebruary: 28 \u2192 total 31 + 28 = 59\n\nMarch: 31 \u2192 59 + 31 = 90\n\nApril: 30 \u2192 90 + 30 = 120\n\nMay: 31 \u2192 120 + 31 = 151\n\nJune: 30 \u2192 151 + 30 = 181\n\nJuly: 31 \u2192 181 + 31 = 212\n\nAugust: 31 \u2192 212 + 31 = 243\n\nSeptember: 30 \u2192 243 + 30 = 273\n\nOctober: 31 \u2192 273 + 31 = 304\n\nSo from January 1 to October 31 is 304 days. Then November 1 is the next day, so 305 days after January 1, 2022. Now, since January 1, 2022, was a Sunday, adding 305 days to that. Now, 305 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and days. 7*43 = 301, so 305 - 301 = 4 days. So 305 days later is 43 weeks and 4 days. So Sunday + 4 days is Thursday. Wait, but that would mean November 1, 2022, is a Thursday? But earlier I thought it was a Tuesday. That's a contradiction. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the number of days from January 1 to November 1.\n\nWait, January has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February is 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31. So adding those up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n\n+31 (Mar) = 90\n\n+30 (Apr) = 120\n\n+31 (May) = 151\n\n+30 (Jun) = 181\n\n+31 (Jul) = 212\n\n+31 (Aug) = 243\n\n+30 (Sep) = 273\n\n+31 (Oct) = 304. So October 31 is 304 days after January 1. Therefore, November 1 is 305 days after January 1. So 305 divided by 7 is 43 weeks and 4 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then adding 4 days would be Thursday. So November 1 is a Thursday. But earlier I thought it was a Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I confused the day. Let me check another way. For example, I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. If November 1 is a Thursday, then November 1 + 30 days is December 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. But I thought December 1 was a Thursday. That's conflicting. So that suggests that my calculation is wrong. Therefore, there must be an error in my calculation of the number of days between January 1 and November 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, I think I might be wrong about that. Let me check. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, no, I need to be careful here. Let me recall that January 1, 2021, was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022, would be a Saturday. Wait, that's correct. Because 2021 started on Friday, so next year starts on Saturday. So January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So that changes things. So if January 1, 2022, was a Saturday, then adding 305 days would be 305 days later. Let's recalculate.\n\nSo 305 days after Saturday. 305 divided by 7 is 43*7=301, remainder 4. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. So November 1, 2022, would be a Wednesday? Wait, but that contradicts the previous thought that December 1 was a Thursday. Let me check again. If November 1 is Wednesday, then November 1 + 30 days is December 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. But I thought December 1 was a Thursday. So that's conflicting again. Therefore, there's a problem here. Maybe my initial assumption about January 1, 2022, is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let me think of some known dates. For example, I know that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. If November 1 is a Wednesday, then November 4 would be Saturday. But that's not matching. Wait, if November 1 is Wednesday, then November 2 is Thursday, 3 is Friday, 4 is Saturday. But I thought November 4 was a Friday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let me check the actual day of the week for November 1, 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use another method. Let me think of the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. If that's correct, then November 1 would be 30 days before. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if December 1 is Thursday, then November 1 is Thursday minus 2 days, which is Tuesday. So November 1 is Tuesday. That would make sense. So that would mean that my initial thought was correct. So why did the calculation with January 1 give me a different answer?\n\nAh, because I think I made a mistake in the number of days between January 1 and November 1. Let me recalculate that. Let me check again. January 1 to November 1 is 304 days? Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28 is 31+28=59. March 31 is 59+31=90. April 30 is 90+30=120. May 31 is 120+31=151. June 30 is 151+30=181. July 31 is 181+31=212. August 31 is 212+31=243. September 30 is 243+30=273. October 31 is 273+31=304. So November 1 is 305 days after January 1. But if January 1 is Saturday, then 305 days later is Saturday + 305 days. 305 divided by 7 is 43*7=301, remainder 4. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. But according to the other method, November 1 is Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the assumptions is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So 2022 is one year before. Since 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2023, is Sunday, then January 1, 2022, would be Sunday minus 1 day, which is Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Therefore, the calculation that November 1 is Wednesday is correct. But that contradicts the other method where December 1 is Thursday, which would imply November 1 is Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the December 1 calculation. If November 1 is Wednesday, then November 1 + 30 days is December 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. But I thought December 1 was a Thursday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there's a problem here. Maybe my assumption that December 1 is Thursday is wrong. Let me think of another way. Let me check the day of the week for December 1, 2022. If I can find that, I can check.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 1, 2022, is 31 days after November 1. If November 1 is Wednesday, then December 1 is Wednesday + 31 days. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. So December 1 would be Saturday. But I thought it was Thursday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there's a problem here. So where is the mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. For example, I know that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. If November 1 is Tuesday, then November 4 is Friday. That's correct. So that would mean that November 1 is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the previous calculation that November 1 is Wednesday must be wrong. Therefore, where is the error in the calculation of the days between January 1 and November 1?\n\nLet me check again. If January 1, 2022, is Saturday, then adding 305 days would be 305 days later. Let me calculate 305 divided by 7. 7*43=301, 305-301=4. So 4 days after Saturday is Wednesday. But that contradicts the other method. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the number of days between January 1 and November 1. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I added the days incorrectly. Let me recount the days from January 1 to November 1. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31+28=59. March has 31, so 59+31=90. April 30: 90+30=120. May 31: 120+31=151. June 30: 151+30=181. July 31: 181+31=212. August 31: 212+31=243. September 30: 243+30=273. October 31: 273+31=304. So November 1 is 305 days after January 1. So that's correct. So if January 1 is Saturday, then November 1 is 305 days later, which is 43 weeks and 4 days. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. But that contradicts the other method where November 1 is Tuesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that January 1, 2022, is Saturday. Let me check that again. If January 1, 2023, is Sunday, then 2022 is one year before. Since 2022 is not a leap year, the day of the week advances by 1 day. So January 1, 2022, would be Sunday minus 1 day, which is Saturday. That seems correct. So that's correct. Therefore, the calculation that November 1 is Wednesday is correct. But then why does the other method say it's Tuesday?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the other method. Let me think again. If November 1 is Wednesday, then November 4 is Saturday. But I thought November 4 was Friday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about November 4 being Friday. Let me think. If November 1 is Wednesday, then November 2 is Thursday, 3 is Friday, 4 is Saturday. So November 4 is Saturday. But I thought it was Friday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there's a mistake in my assumption. So where is the error?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. For example, I know that"], [99, "In a year where Monday is January 1st, name the weekday of January 4. Provide the full name of the weekday.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where January 1st is a Monday, what day of the week is January 4th? I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1st is a Monday. So, let's count the days from January 1st to January 4th. January 1st is Monday. Then January 2nd would be the next day, which is Tuesday. January 3rd would be Wednesday. Then January 4th would be Thursday. Wait, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can take the number of days between the two dates and find the remainder when divided by 7. The difference between January 4th and January 1st is 3 days. So 3 days after Monday. Monday plus 1 day is Tuesday, plus 2 days is Wednesday, plus 3 days is Thursday. So that confirms it again. \n\nAnother way to think about it: If January 1 is Monday, then adding 7 days would be the same day of the week. So January 8th is also Monday. But that's not necessary here since we only need up to the 4th. So 1st is Monday, 2nd Tuesday, 3rd Wednesday, 4th Thursday. Yep, that's four days later. Wait, no, the 4th is three days after the 1st. Because 1st is day 0, 2nd is +1, 3rd +2, 4th +3. So three days later. So Monday plus three days is Thursday. \n\nI think that's correct. Maybe I can check with another method. Let's list out the days:\n\nJanuary 1: Monday\n\nJanuary 2: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 3: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 4: Thursday\n\nYes, that's four days in total. So the answer should be Thursday. I don't see any mistakes here. The key is that each subsequent day increments the weekday by one. So adding three days to Monday gives Thursday. \n\nAlternatively, if I use the concept of modulo 7. Let's assign numbers to days. Let's say Monday is 0, Tuesday 1, Wednesday 2, Thursday 3, and so on. Then January 1 is 0. January 4 is 0 + 3 = 3, which corresponds to Thursday. That's another way to confirm. \n\nSo all methods point to Thursday. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>", "Thursday"], [99, "On which weekday did May 13, 2022 fall? Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week May 13, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that sometimes you can use known dates to work this out. For example, if I know that a certain date is a specific day, I can count forward or backward to find others.\n\nFirst, I should check if I remember any key dates from 2022. Wait, I think that May 1st, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then adding days to that could help. Let's see: May 1 is Saturday. Then May 2 is Sunday, May 3 is Monday, May 4 is Tuesday, May 5 is Wednesday, May 6 is Thursday, May 7 is Friday, May 8 is Saturday. Wait, that seems off. Wait, if May 1 is Saturday, then May 8 would be the next Saturday. So May 8 is Saturday. Then May 9 is Sunday, May 10 is Monday, May 11 is Tuesday, May 12 is Wednesday, and May 13 would be Thursday. Wait, but that would make May 13 a Thursday. But I'm not sure if May 1 was actually a Saturday. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me think. 2022 started on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then, let's count the number of days from January 1 to May 13. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 1). Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March has 31, April has 30, and then May 13 is the 13th day of May.\n\nSo total days from January 1 to May 13 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 13 (May) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 13 is 133 days. Wait, but January 1 is day 1, so the total days from January 1 to May 13 inclusive would be 133 days. But if January 1 is a Sunday, then adding 132 days (since day 1 is Sunday) would get to May 13. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the number of days between January 1 and May 13. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1 is day 1 (Sunday), then January 2 is day 2 (Monday), and so on. So to find the day of the week for May 13, I can calculate the total number of days from January 1 to May 13, then take that number modulo 7. Because each week has 7 days.\n\nSo total days from Jan 1 to May 13: Let's calculate:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March 31, April 30, and May 13. So total days from Jan 1 to May 13 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 13 (May) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 13 is 133. So 133 days total. But since January 1 is day 1, then May 13 is day 133. So the number of days after January 1 is 132 days (since day 1 is the first day). So 132 days later. Now, 132 divided by 7 is 18 weeks and 6 days (since 18*7=126, 132-126=6). So 6 days after Sunday. Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. Wait, that would mean May 13 is a Saturday? But earlier I thought May 1 was Saturday, which would make May 13 a Thursday. There's a contradiction here. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is incorrect. Let me check that. Wait, I think I might be mixing up the years. Let me recall: 2021 started on a Monday. So 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 would start on a Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. But I thought it was a Sunday. That's conflicting. So maybe I need to check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or some other method. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that again. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday. So May 13 would be a Friday. Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. July 4, 2022. If I can figure out that date, then I can work backward. Let's see. If July 4 is a Monday, then June 30 is a Sunday. Let's check the days in June. June has 30 days. So June 1 is a Thursday (since June 30 is Sunday). Wait, if June 30 is Sunday, then June 29 is Saturday, June 28 is Friday, June 27 is Thursday, and so on. So June 1 would be a Thursday. Then May 31 would be a Tuesday (since May has 31 days, so May 31 is 31 days before June 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So June 1 is Thursday, so May 31 is Thursday minus 3 days, which is Monday. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if June 1 is Thursday, then May 31 is the day before, which would be Wednesday. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. If June 1 is Thursday, then May 31 is the previous day, which is Wednesday. Then May 31 is Wednesday. Then May 13 is 28 days before May 31. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so May 13 would be the same day as May 31. So if May 31 is Wednesday, then May 13 is also Wednesday. But that contradicts the previous thought that May 1 was Sunday. Wait, but if May 13 is Wednesday, then May 1 would be 12 days before. 12 days before May 13 is May 1. 12 days is 1 week (7 days) and 5 days. So if May 13 is Wednesday, then May 1 is Wednesday minus 5 days, which is Friday. So May 1 would be a Friday. But that contradicts my previous thought that May 1 was a Saturday. So now I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. Let's think about April 1, 2022. If I can figure that out, then I can work forward. Let's say April 1 is a Friday. Then April 8 is Friday, April 15 is Friday, April 22 is Friday, April 29 is Friday. Then May 6 is Friday. Then May 13 would be Friday again. Wait, that would make May 13 a Friday. But earlier calculations suggested different things. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the day of the week for a specific date that I know. For example, I know that May 13, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, but how can I confirm that? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 was a Friday. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that again. If May 1 is Saturday, then May 8 is Saturday, May 15 is Saturday. Then May 13 would be Thursday. But that contradicts the other approach. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's true, then let's calculate the day of the week for May 13. Let's do that again. January 1 is Sunday. Then January 1 + 31 days is January 31, which is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 31 is Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. Then February 1 is Thursday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days later, which is exactly 4 weeks, so same day as February 1, which is Thursday. So March 1 is Thursday. March has 31 days. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 31 is Thursday + 3 days = Sunday. April 1 is Monday. April has 30 days, so April 30 is 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 30 is Monday + 2 days = Wednesday. Then May 1 is Thursday. Wait, so May 1 is Thursday. Then May 13 is 12 days later. 12 days is 1 week and 5 days. So Thursday + 5 days is Tuesday. Wait, that would make May 13 a Tuesday. But that contradicts the previous calculations. Now I'm really confused. Where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, let's go step by step again. If January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday\n\nJanuary 15: Sunday\n\nJanuary 22: Sunday\n\nJanuary 29: Sunday\n\nFebruary 5: Sunday\n\nFebruary 12: Sunday\n\nFebruary 19: Sunday\n\nFebruary 26: Sunday\n\nMarch 5: Sunday\n\nMarch 12: Sunday\n\nMarch 19: Sunday\n\nMarch 26: Sunday\n\nApril 2: Sunday\n\nApril 9: Sunday\n\nApril 16: Sunday\n\nApril 23: Sunday\n\nApril 30: Sunday\n\nSo April 30 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, if April 30 is Sunday, then May 1 is Monday. Then May 1 is Monday. Then May 8 is Monday, May 15 is Monday, May 13 is 2 days before May 15, which is Saturday. Wait, so May 13 would be Saturday. But according to this, May 1 is Monday. So that would mean May 13 is Saturday. But earlier when I thought that May 1 was Saturday, that was wrong. So where did I get that from? Maybe I confused the year. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then April 30 is Sunday. So May 1 is Monday. Then May 13 is 12 days after May 1. 12 days is 1 week (7 days) and 5 days. So Monday + 5 days is Saturday. So May 13 is Saturday. But earlier when I thought that May 1 was Saturday, that was incorrect. So the correct answer would be Saturday?\n\nBut then, how does that align with the other approach where I thought that May 13 was Friday? I must have made a mistake in that approach. So according to this calculation, May 13, 2022 is a Saturday. But I need to confirm this. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's check that. If May 13 is Saturday, then May 13 + 21 days is June 13 (since 21 days is 3 weeks). June 13 would be Saturday. Then June 20 is Saturday, June 27 is Saturday. July 4 is 7 days after June 27, which is Saturday. So July 4 would be Saturday. But I thought July 4 was a Monday. That's conflicting. So that suggests that my calculation is wrong. Therefore, there must be an error in my previous steps.\n\nWait, if July 4 is a Monday, then June 27 is a Monday (since July 4 is 7 days after June 27). Then June 20 is Monday, June 13 is Monday, June 6 is Monday, May 30 is Monday. Then May 30 is Monday. Then May 13 is 17 days before May 30. 17 days is 2 weeks and 3 days. So May 13 would be Monday minus 3 days, which is Friday. So May 13 is Friday. But according to the previous calculation, May 13 was Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is very confusing. I need to find a way to resolve this. Let me try again. Let's start with July 4, 2022 being a Monday. If that's correct, then let's work backward. July 4 is Monday. July 3 is Sunday, July 2 is Saturday, July 1 is Friday. June 30 is Thursday. June 29 is Wednesday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 27 is Monday. June 27 is Monday. Then June 20 is Monday (since 7 days before June 27). June 13 is Monday, June 6 is Monday, May 30 is Monday. Then May 23 is Monday, May 16 is Monday, May 9 is Monday, May 2 is Monday. Then May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 13 is 12 days later. 12 days is 1 week and 5 days. Sunday + 5 days is Friday. So May 13 is Friday. That aligns with the July 4 being Monday. So that suggests that May 13 is Friday. But earlier when I calculated based on January 1 being Sunday, I got Saturday. So where is the mistake there?\n\nLet me check the January 1 calculation again. If January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then let's count the days to May 13. January has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28 days, March 31, April 30, and May 13. So total days from January 1 to May 13 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 13 = 133 days. But since January 1 is day 1, then May 13 is day 133. The number of days after January 1 is 132 days. 132 divided by 7 is 18 weeks and 6 days. So 18 weeks is 126 days, 132-126=6. So 6 days after Sunday is Saturday. But according to the other method, May 13 is Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the assumptions is wrong. Which one?\n\nIf July 4 is Monday, then May 1 is Sunday. So January 1, 2022 must be a Sunday. Wait, but if May 1 is Sunday, then January 1 is how many days before? Let's calculate the number of days from January 1 to May 1. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to April 30 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 = 120 days. Then May 1 is 121 days after January 1. So if May 1 is Sunday, then January 1 is 120 days before May 1. 120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 1 day. So 120 days is 17 weeks and 1 day. So if May 1 is Sunday, then January 1 is Sunday minus 1 day, which is Saturday. Wait, that would mean January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. But earlier I thought it was a Sunday. So that's the mistake. I must have confused the day of the week for January 1, 2022. So if May 1 is Sunday, then January 1 is Saturday. Therefore, the previous calculation where I thought January 1 was Sunday was wrong. So that explains the discrepancy.\n\nSo if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then let's recalculate. January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. February 5 is Saturday, February 12 is Saturday, February 19 is Saturday, February 26 is Saturday.

Let me start by recalling what day January 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think I remember that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I should check a calendar or use some method to verify. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know some other dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2021, was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding one day to January 1, 2021, would make January 1, 2022, a Sunday? Wait, that contradicts my initial thought. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, 2020 was a leap year, so 2020 had 366 days. So 2020 to 2021 would be 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 days. Therefore, January 1, 2021, would be two days after January 1, 2020. If January 1, 2020, was a Wednesday, then adding two days would make January 1, 2021, a Friday. Wait, but I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look up the actual day. Alternatively, I can use an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check with another method. For example, I know that July 4, 2021, was a Monday. Then July 4, 2022, would be two weeks later, so also a Monday. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me assume that for now. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then the first Tuesday would be the 3rd (since Saturday is 1, Sunday 2, Monday 3, Tuesday 4? Wait no. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then the days go like this: 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue). So the first Tuesday is the 4th. Then the second Tuesday would be the 11th, third is 18th, fourth is 25th. So the fourth Tuesday would be the 25th. But wait, January has 31 days, so 25th is valid. Therefore, the answer would be 25. But wait, I need to make sure that my initial assumption about January 1, 2022, being a Saturday is correct. Let me try to verify that. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So if 2022 is one year before that, then 2022 would have 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2023, is Sunday, then January 1, 2022, would be 365 days before. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day, so subtracting one day from Sunday would be Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022, was indeed a Saturday. So that's correct. Therefore, the first Tuesday is the 4th, then 11th, 18th, 25th. So the fourth Tuesday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer is 25. But wait, let me check again. Let me list the dates:\n\nWeek 1: 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue) \u2013 first Tuesday.\n\nWeek 2: 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri), 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue) \u2013 second Tuesday.\n\nWeek 3: 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri), 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun), 17 (Mon), 18 (Tue) \u2013 third Tuesday.\n\nWeek 4: 19 (Wed), 20 (Thu), 21 (Fri), 22 (Sat), 23 (Sun), 24 (Mon), 25 (Tue) \u2013 fourth Tuesday.\n\nYes, that's correct.

So first Friday is the 7th. Then the second Friday would be the 14th, third Friday the 21st, and fourth Friday the 28th. Wait, but October has 31 days, so 28th is a Friday. Then the fifth Friday would be the 35th, but that's beyond October. So the fourth Friday would be the 28th. But wait, is October 1, 2022, actually a Saturday?\n\nWait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the days of the week for some known dates. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, July 1, 2022, was a Friday? Let me think. Wait, July 1, 2022, was actually a Friday. Then, if I can count the days from July to October, maybe I can figure out the days for October.\n\nBut maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let me think again. If October 1 is a Saturday, then the first Friday is the 7th. Then adding 7 days each time. So 7, 14, 21, 28. So the fourth Friday would be the 28th. But if that's correct, then the answer is 28.

Wait, if that's the case, then October 31 is Monday. Let's see. If October 31 is Monday, then October 30 is Sunday, 29 is Saturday, 28 is Friday. So that would mean that the fourth Friday is the 28th. Which matches the previous calculation. So that seems to confirm that the fourth Friday is the 28th. But how do I know that October 31, 2022, was a Monday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Because if October 31 is Monday, then November 1 is Tuesday. Let me check that. If November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday, then that's correct. Wait, I think that's right. Because in 2022, November 1 was a Tuesday. So if that's the case, then October 31 would be a Monday. Therefore, the fourth Friday is the 28th. Therefore, the answer is 28.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the first week of October. If October 1 is Saturday, then the first Friday is the 7th. Then the next Friday is the 14th, then 21st, then 28th. So that's four Fridays. So the fourth one is the 28th. Therefore, the answer is 28. But I need to make sure that October 1, 2022, was indeed a Saturday. How can I confirm that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022, was a Sunday, then I can count the days for each month. Let's see. January has 31 days. So January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Sunday. Wait, but 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So February 28 is a Tuesday. Then March 1 is a Wednesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 8, 15, 22, 29. Then April 5, 12, 19, 26. Then May 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. Then June 7, 14, 21, 28.

Wait, the start date is a Sunday. Let me check: August 28, 2022 is a Sunday. Then the next day, August 29 is a Monday, August 30 is Tuesday, August 31 is Wednesday.

So only one Saturday in the period? But that seems too few. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the days between the two dates and see how many weeks there are. Let's calculate the total number of days from August 28 to September 8 inclusive. August 28 to August 31 is 4 days (including August 28). Then September 1 to September 8 is 8 days. So total days is 4 + 8 = 12 days. Wait, but wait, if you include both start and end dates, then August 28 to August 29 is 2 days. So August 28 to August 31 is 4 days (28,29,30,31). Then September 1 to September 8 is 8 days. So total 4 + 8 = 12 days. So 12 days in total. Now, how many Saturdays are in 12 days?\n\nSince the first day is Sunday, August 28. So the days of the week would be:\n\nDay 1: Sunday (Aug 28)\n\nDay 2: Monday (Aug 29)\n\nDay 3: Tuesday (Aug 30)\n\nDay 4: Wednesday (Aug 31)\n\nDay 5: Thursday (Sep 1)\n\nDay 6: Friday (Sep 2)\n\nDay 7: Saturday (Sep 3)\n\nDay 8: Sunday (Sep 4)\n\nDay 9: Monday (Sep 5)\n\nDay 10: Tuesday (Sep 6)\n\nDay 11: Wednesday (Sep 7)\n\nDay 12: Thursday (Sep 8)\n\nSo in this list, the Saturdays are on day 7 (Sep 3).

The end date is Saturday, December 31, 2022. And we need to include both dates in the calculation.\n\nLet me list out the days between those two dates. December 30 is a Friday. Then December 31 is a Saturday. So the period includes two days: Friday and Saturday. But since business days are Monday-Friday, Saturday is a weekend and not counted. So, the only business day here is Friday, December 30. Wait, but the end date is Saturday, so does that include Saturday? The question says inclusive of both dates. So both Friday and Saturday are included. But Saturday is not a business day. So that would mean only one business day.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there are any other days in between.

November has 30 days, so from November 24 to November 30 is 7 days (including both ends?), wait no. Wait, November 24 is the first day. Then November 25 is +1 day, etc. So from November 24 to November 30 is 7 days (since 30-24=6 days, plus 1 for inclusive). Wait, if I include both start and end dates, the total days would be (end date - start date + 1). Let me check that. For example, from day 1 to day 3 inclusive is 3 days.

But since I don't have a calendar here, maybe I can calculate it. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that I know some dates. For example, I know that December 7, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, the problem says the end date is Wednesday, December 7. So that's a Wednesday. So the start date is Thursday, November 24. So the period starts on a Thursday and ends on a Wednesday. So the total number of days between them is (December 7 - November 24) + 1. Let me calculate that.\n\nNovember has 30 days. So from November 24 to November 30 is 30 - 24 = 6 days. Then December 1 to December 7 is 7 days. So total days is 6 + 7 = 13 days. Wait, but adding 1 because it's inclusive. Wait, if I take November 24 (day 1) to November 30 (day 7), that's 7 days. Then December 1 to 7 is 7 days. So total is 7 + 7 = 14 days? Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. The start date is November 24, and the end date is December 7. So the number of days between them is (December 7 - November 24) + 1. Let me compute the difference in days. November has 30 days, so November 24 to November 30 is 6 days (since 30-24=6, but if you count from 24 to 30 inclusive, that's 7 days). Wait, maybe I should calculate the total days as (30 - 24) + 1 (for November) plus 7 (for December). So 7 + 7 = 14 days. So the total number of days is 14. So from November 24 to December 7 inclusive is 14 days.\n\nNow, the question is how many Wednesdays are in this period. Let's think about the days of the week.

But wait, if you include both start and end dates, then the total number of days is 25.

So the first day is Sunday, then the next days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (day 3), then Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (day 7), and so on. So in 25 days, how many Wednesdays?\n\nWell, the first Wednesday is day 3 (April 27). Then each week after that. So day 3, 10, 17, 24. Wait, day 24 would be May 17? Wait, let me check. Wait, day 1 is April 24 (Sunday). Then day 3 is April 26? Wait, no. Wait, day 1 is April 24 (Sunday). Then day 2 is April 25 (Monday), day 3 is April 26 (Tuesday), day 4 is April 27 (Wednesday). Oh, right. So the first Wednesday is day 4. Then day 4 + 7 = day 11 (May 4), then day 18 (May 11), day 25 (May 18). So that's four Wednesdays. So that's four. So the answer is 4. So the count is 4.\n\nBut wait, the end date is May 18, which is day 25. So that's included. So yes, four Wednesdays. Therefore, the answer should be 4.\n</think>", "4"], [99, "If the first day of the year was a Tuesday, what day of the week will March 26 be? Reply with just the weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If the first day of the year was a Tuesday, what day of the week will March 26 be? I need to figure out the answer step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how many days are in each month. Since the first day of the year is Tuesday, and we're dealing with a non-leap year? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, but the question is about March 26. So if the year is a leap year, February would have 29 days, otherwise 28. But since the first day of the year is Tuesday, maybe the year is not a leap year? Wait, no, the problem doesn't say. Wait, but maybe the answer is the same regardless? Or maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year? Wait, but maybe the problem is in a specific context. Wait, the problem is probably assuming a non-leap year because if it's a leap year, the question would have mentioned it. Or maybe not. Hmm. Wait, but maybe I need to check both possibilities? Wait, but maybe the answer is the same. Wait, no. Let me think. Let's assume it's a non-leap year first. So, January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, etc. So, if the first day of the year is Tuesday, then January 1 is Tuesday. Then, I need to find out what day of the week March 26 is.\n\nSo, let's break it down. Let's calculate the number of days from January 1 to March 26. So, January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year), so adding 28 days. Then March 26 is 26 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 26 (March) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 26 is 85 days. Wait, but wait, if I'm counting from January 1 to March 26 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 2 is day 2, etc. So, the number of days between January 1 and March 26 is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 26 (days in March) minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find the number of days from January 1 to March 26, inclusive, then it's 31 + 28 + 26. But if I want the number of days between January 1 and March 26, not including January 1, then it's 31 + 28 + 25. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, the number of days between two dates is important. Let me think. If January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday), then January 2 is day 1 (Wednesday), etc. So, the number of days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 26 (March) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I have January 1 as day 0, then January 1 is day 0, January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31, and so on. So, March 26 would be day 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (March) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 25 is 84. So, day 84. Then, since each week has 7 days, the day of the week is (day number) mod 7. Since day 0 is Tuesday, then day 1 is Wednesday, day 2 is Thursday, etc. So, 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 mod 7 is 0. So that would mean that March 26 is the same day as January 1, which is Tuesday. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, because if January 1 is Tuesday, then adding 7 days would be Tuesday again. So, 84 days later would be Tuesday again. But that would mean March 26 is a Tuesday? But that seems off. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's count the days again. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March 26 is 26 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But if January 1 is day 1, then March 26 is day 85. But if we want to find the number of days between January 1 and March 26, inclusive, then that's 85 days. But when calculating the day of the week, if January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday), then day 0 is Tuesday, day 1 is Wednesday, etc. So, if March 26 is day 84 (since 85 days from day 0 would be day 84?), wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. Let's take an example. If January 1 is Tuesday (day 0), then January 2 is day 1 (Wednesday), January 3 is day 2 (Thursday), ..., January 8 is day 7 (Tuesday again). So, day 7 is Tuesday. So, if I have 84 days later, that would be 84 days after day 0. So, 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 84 days later is also Tuesday. So, March 26 would be Tuesday? But that seems like maybe the answer is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So, from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. So, adding 28 days to January 31 would take us to March 1. Then March 26 is 26 days after March 1. So, total days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But if January 1 is day 0, then March 26 is day 84? Wait, no. Because if January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, so day 84 would be 85 days after January 1. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the number of days between January 1 and March 26, not including January 1. So, if I want to find how many days after January 1 is March 26, then it's 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 26 (days in March) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I have January 1 as day 0, then the next day is day 1. So, the number of days between January 1 and March 26 is 85 days. But if I want to find the day of the week, then the number of days after January 1 is 84 days. Because day 0 is January 1. So, 84 days later would be day 84. Then, 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So, day 84 is the same as day 0, which is Tuesday. Therefore, March 26 is a Tuesday. But that seems conflicting with my intuition. Wait, maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the days for each month. January has 31 days. So, January 1 is Tuesday. Then, January 8 is Tuesday (7 days later), January 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Wednesday, January 31 is Thursday. So, February 1 is Friday. Then, February has 28 days. So, February 1 is Friday. Then, February 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 29 is Friday (if it's a leap year, but we're assuming non-leap year, so February 28 is Friday. Wait, no. Wait, if February 1 is Friday, then February 28 is 27 days later. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So, Friday + 6 days is Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I should count the days step by step. Let's see:\n\nFebruary 1 is Friday. Then:\n\nFebruary 1: Friday\n\nFebruary 2: Saturday\n\nFebruary 3: Sunday\n\nFebruary 4: Monday\n\nFebruary 5: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 6: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 7: Thursday\n\nFebruary 8: Friday (7 days later)\n\nSo, every 7 days, it cycles. So, February 28 is 27 days after February 1. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 6 days. So, Friday + 6 days is Thursday. So, February 28 is Thursday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. So, March 29 is Friday. Then March 26 is three days before March 29. So, March 26 is Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. So, according to this step-by-step, March 26 is Wednesday. But earlier calculation said Tuesday. So, there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? Let me check again. First approach: total days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. If January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday), then day 84 is 84 days later. 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks, so same day. So, day 84 is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step, March 26 is Wednesday. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the first approach. Let me check the step-by-step again. Let's start with January 1 as Tuesday. Then:\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 8: Tuesday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 22: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 29: Tuesday\n\nThen January 30: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 31: Thursday\n\nFebruary 1: Friday\n\nFebruary 2: Saturday\n\nFebruary 3: Sunday\n\nFebruary 4: Monday\n\nFebruary 5: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 6: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 7: Thursday\n\nFebruary 8: Friday\n\nFebruary 9: Saturday\n\nFebruary 10: Sunday\n\nFebruary 11: Monday\n\nFebruary 12: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 13: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 14: Thursday\n\nFebruary 15: Friday\n\nFebruary 16: Saturday\n\nFebruary 17: Sunday\n\nFebruary 18: Monday\n\nFebruary 19: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 20: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 21: Thursday\n\nFebruary 22: Friday\n\nFebruary 23: Saturday\n\nFebruary 24: Sunday\n\nFebruary 25: Monday\n\nFebruary 26: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 27: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 28: Thursday\n\nSo, February 28 is Thursday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is Friday, March 15 is Friday, March 22 is Friday, March 29 is Friday. So March 26 is three days before March 29. March 29 is Friday, so March 28 is Thursday, March 27 is Wednesday, March 26 is Tuesday. Wait, that's different from my previous step-by-step. Wait, earlier I thought March 26 was Wednesday, but now I'm getting Tuesday. Wait, what's the correct way?\n\nWait, March 1 is Friday. Then March 2 is Saturday, March 3 is Sunday, March 4 is Monday, March 5 is Tuesday, March 6 is Wednesday, March 7 is Thursday, March 8 is Friday. So, March 8 is Friday. Then March 15 is Friday, March 22 is Friday, March 29 is Friday. So March 26 is three days before March 29. March 29 is Friday. March 28 is Thursday, March 27 is Wednesday, March 26 is Tuesday. So that's Tuesday. So that's conflicting with my previous step-by-step where I thought March 26 was Wednesday. So where was the mistake?\n\nEarlier, I thought that March 29 is Friday, so March 26 is three days before, which would be Tuesday. So that's correct. So why did I think earlier that March 26 was Wednesday? Probably a miscalculation. So according to this step-by-step, March 26 is Tuesday. But then why did the first approach say that 85 days later is Tuesday? Wait, because if January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday), then March 26 is day 84 (since 85 days later would be day 84?), but 84 days later is 12 weeks, so same day. So that's correct. So both methods agree that March 26 is Tuesday. So why did I think earlier that March 26 was Wednesday? Because I made a mistake in the step-by-step. So the correct answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to March 26. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 26 is 26 days. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But if January 1 is day 0, then March 26 is day 84. Because day 0 is January 1, day 1 is January 2, ..., day 84 is March 26. So 84 days later. 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks. So same day. So Tuesday. So that's correct. So the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's use the fact that January 1 is Tuesday. Then, let's find the day of the week for March 26 by adding the number of days in each month. So, January has 31 days. So, 31 days later is January 1 + 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So, adding 3 days to Tuesday is Friday. So, January 1 + 31 days is January 31, which is Thursday (as per earlier step-by-step). Wait, but according to this, adding 3 days to Tuesday would be Friday. But earlier step-by-step said January 31 is Thursday. So that's conflicting. Wait, what's the problem here?\n\nWait, if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 + 7 days is Tuesday again. So, January 8 is Tuesday. Then January 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Wednesday, January 31 is Thursday. So, January 31 is Thursday. So, adding 31 days to January 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, remainder 3. So, 3 days after Tuesday is Friday. But according to the step-by-step, it's Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the calculation. Let me check. If January 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 + 1 day is Tuesday + 1 day = Wednesday. January 1 + 2 days is Thursday. January 1 + 3 days is Friday. January 1 + 4 days is Saturday. January 1 + 5 days is Sunday. January 1 + 6 days is Monday. January 1 + 7 days is Tuesday. So, 31 days later is 31 mod 7. 31 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, remainder 3. So, 3 days after Tuesday is Friday. But according to the step-by-step, January 31 is Thursday. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because when you add 31 days to January 1, you are getting January 31 + 1 day? Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is day 0. Then January 1 + 31 days is January 31 + 1 day? No. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30. So, 31 days later would be day 30. Wait, that's the confusion. So, if you add 31 days to January 1, you get January 31 + 1 day? No. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 1 + 31 days is day 31. But January 1 + 31 days is January 31 + 1 day? No, January 1 + 31 days is January 31 + 1 day? Wait, no. January has 31 days. So, January 1 + 30 days"], [99, "How many Wednesdays are there from Friday, December 2, 2022 to Wednesday, December 7, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Provide the count as a number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many Wednesdays there are from Friday, December 2, 2022, to Wednesday, December 7, 2022, inclusive. So I need to count all the Wednesdays between these two dates, including both the start and end dates.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the days of the week for each date in this range. Let me start by noting the starting date: Friday, December 2, 2022. Then the next days would be Saturday the 3rd, Sunday the 4th, Monday the 5th, Tuesday the 6th, and Wednesday the 7th. Wait, but the end date is Wednesday, December 7th. So the dates in question are from the 2nd (Friday) up to the 7th (Wednesday).\n\nLet me list out each day from the 2nd to the 7th and note their days of the week:\n\n- December 2, 2022: Friday\n- December 3: Saturday\n- December 4: Sunday\n- December 5: Monday\n- December 6: Tuesday\n- December 7: Wednesday\n\nSo the dates are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Now, the question is how many Wednesdays are in this period. Looking at the list, the only Wednesday is December 7th. But wait, the start date is Friday, so the first day is Friday. The next day is Saturday, then Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and then Wednesday on the 7th. So that's one Wednesday. But wait, the problem says inclusive of both dates. So the start date is Friday, which is not a Wednesday, and the end date is Wednesday, which is a Wednesday. So the count should be 1? But wait, maybe I need to check if there's another Wednesday in between. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the dates from the 2nd to the 7th are six days. Let me count the days again:\n\n2: Friday\n\n3: Saturday\n\n4: Sunday\n\n5: Monday\n\n6: Tuesday\n\n7: Wednesday\n\nSo only the 7th is a Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be 1. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm the days of the week for those dates. Let me check an actual calendar or use another method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of days between the two dates. From December 2 to December 7 is 6 days. Since the start date is Friday, adding 1 day (Saturday), 2 days (Sunday), 3 days (Monday), 4 days (Tuesday), 5 days (Wednesday). Wait, so the 7th is 5 days after the 2nd. So the 2nd is Friday, then 5 days later is Wednesday. So that's correct. So only one Wednesday in that period. Therefore, the answer is 1. But wait, maybe the problem is considering that the start date is included, but since it's a Friday, it's not a Wednesday. The end date is included, which is Wednesday. So only one Wednesday. So the answer is 1. But wait, maybe I need to check if there's another Wednesday. Let me think again. The dates are 2 (Fri), 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed).

Give the weekday name in full.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If today is Thursday, February 3, 2022, what day of the week will it be in 84 days? I need to find the weekday name in full.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 84 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 84 divided by 7 is exactly 12. So that means 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. Since 12 weeks is 84 days, that would mean that adding 84 days to Thursday would still be Thursday, right? Because each week cycles every 7 days. So adding 7 days would be the same day, so 12 times that would be the same day. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, the original date is February 3, 2022. Let me think. 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're adding 84 days, maybe I need to check if the date crosses into different months and if there are any months with 31 days or something. But wait, the problem is not asking for the actual date, just the day of the week. So maybe the number of days is exactly 12 weeks, so the day of the week would be the same. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this. Let me think again. Let's take a smaller number. For example, if today is Thursday, then 7 days later is also Thursday. 14 days later is Thursday again. So 84 days is 12*7, so same day. Therefore, the answer should be Thursday. \n\nBut maybe I should check if there's a mistake here. Let me think. Suppose I add 84 days to February 3, 2022. Let's try to count the days step by step. \n\nFirst, February 3, 2022. Let's add 28 days to get to February 28 (since February has 28 days in 2022). Then adding another 28 days would take us to March 28, 2022. Then another 28 days would be April 27, 2022. Wait, but 28 + 28 + 28 is 84 days. Wait, but that would be adding 28 days three times. Wait, but February 3 plus 28 days is February 28 (since 3 + 28 = 31, but February only has 28 days, so 3 + 28 - 28 = 3? Wait, no. Wait, if today is February 3, adding 28 days would be February 3 + 28 days. Let me think. February has 28 days, so from February 3 to February 28 is 25 days (since 28 - 3 = 25). Then adding 28 days would take us to March 28 (since 25 + 28 = 53 days? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just calculate the total days. Let's see. If I add 84 days to February 3, 2022, what date is that? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, February 3, 2022. Let's add 28 days to get to February 28 (since 3 + 28 = 31, but February has 28 days, so 3 + 28 - 28 = 3? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if today is February 3, then adding 28 days would be February 3 + 28 days. Let's count: February has 28 days. So from February 3 to February 28 is 25 days (since 28 - 3 = 25). Then adding 28 days would be 25 + 28 = 53 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should think of it as adding 28 days to February 3. So February 3 + 28 days is March 3, 2022? Because February has 28 days, so adding 25 days would take you to February 28, then adding 3 more days would be March 3. So 28 days later is March 3. Then adding another 28 days would be March 3 + 28 days. March has 31 days, so March 3 + 28 days is April 1 (since March 3 + 28 days is March 3 + 28 days. March has 31 days, so 3 + 28 = 31, so March 3 + 28 days is April 1. Then adding another 28 days would be April 1 + 28 days. April has 30 days, so April 1 + 28 days is May 1. Wait, but that's 28 days added three times. So 28*3=84 days. So starting from February 3, adding 84 days would be May 1, 2022. \n\nNow, let's check what day of the week May 1, 2022 is. But wait, the original date is February 3, 2022, which is a Thursday. So if I add 84 days, which is exactly 12 weeks, then the day of the week should be the same. But maybe I should check if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual day of the week for May 1, 2022. Let me think. Wait, I can use some known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, if I can confirm that, then I can count the days. \n\nWait, but maybe I should use another approach. Let me check the number of days from February 3 to May 1. Let's calculate the days step by step. \n\nFebruary 3 to February 28: 28 - 3 = 25 days. Then March has 31 days, April has 30 days. So from February 28 to March 31 is 31 days. Then from March 31 to April 30 is 30 days. Then from April 30 to May 1 is 1 day. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, if I'm adding 84 days to February 3, then the total days would be 84. Let me check:\n\nFrom February 3 to February 28: 25 days (since 28 - 3 = 25). Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to March 31. Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days would take us to April 30. Then adding 1 day would be May 1. So total days from February 3 to May 1 is 25 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 87 days. Wait, that's 87 days. But that's more than 84. So that can't be right. So maybe my previous calculation was wrong. \n\nWait, maybe I need to calculate the days correctly. Let me start over. \n\nStarting from February 3, 2022. Let's add 84 days. \n\nFirst, February has 28 days. So from February 3 to February 28 is 25 days (since 28 - 3 = 25). Then March has 31 days. So adding 31 days would take us to March 31 (25 + 31 = 56 days). Then April has 30 days. Adding 30 days would take us to April 30 (56 + 30 = 86 days). Then adding 84 days would be 86 - 2 = 84 days. So that would be April 28, 2022. Wait, because 86 days is April 30, so subtract 2 days to get to April 28. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. \n\nIf I have 84 days to add, starting from February 3. \n\nFirst, February 3 to February 28 is 25 days. Then March has 31 days. So adding 31 days would take us to March 31 (25 + 31 = 56 days). Then April has 30 days. So adding 30 days would take us to April 30 (56 + 30 = 86 days). But we need to add only 84 days. So 86 days is April 30, so 84 days would be 2 days before April 30, which is April 28. So the date would be April 28, 2022. \n\nNow, if that's the case, then I need to check what day of the week April 28, 2022 is. But since the original date is February 3, 2022, which is a Thursday. \n\nBut if 84 days is exactly 12 weeks, then adding 12 weeks (84 days) should be the same day of the week. So if February 3 is Thursday, then April 28 should also be Thursday. But maybe I should check if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual day of the week for April 28, 2022. Let me think. \n\nI know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check online, but since I can't, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. \n\nIf that's the case, then let's count the days from January 1 to February 3. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 1 is day 32. So February 3 is day 34. So January 1 is Saturday, so day 34 would be 34 days later. \n\n34 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 6 days. So 4 weeks later is Saturday again, plus 6 days. Saturday + 6 days is Friday. Wait, but that would mean February 3 is a Friday? But the problem says it's Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let me think. \n\nIf February 3, 2022 is Thursday, then let's check what day January 1, 2022 was. \n\nFrom January 1 to February 3 is 31 (January) + 3 (February) - 1 = 33 days? Wait, no. Wait, January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 1 is day 32, February 2 is 33, February 3 is 34. So 34 days from January 1. \n\nIf February 3 is Thursday, then January 1 is 34 days before. 34 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 6 days. So 34 days before Thursday would be 34 - 6 = 28 days before, which is 4 weeks before. So 28 days before Thursday is Thursday again. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, if I subtract 34 days from Thursday, that's equivalent to subtracting 6 days (since 34 mod 7 is 6). So Thursday minus 6 days is... Thursday minus 1 day is Wednesday, minus 2 is Tuesday, minus 3 is Monday, minus 4 is Sunday, minus 5 is Saturday, minus 6 is Friday. So January 1, 2022 would be a Friday? But that contradicts my previous thought. \n\nWait, but if that's the case, then maybe I need to check again. Let me think. If February 3 is Thursday, then January 1 is 34 days earlier. Let's calculate 34 divided by 7. 7*4=28, 34-28=6. So 34 days is 4 weeks and 6 days. So if I go back 6 days from Thursday, that would be Friday (since Thursday minus 1 day is Wednesday, minus 2 is Tuesday, minus 3 is Monday, minus 4 is Sunday, minus 5 is Saturday, minus 6 is Friday). So January 1, 2022 would be a Friday. \n\nBut I thought that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Maybe I was wrong. Let me check another way. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days later is 2022. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. \n\nWait, this is confusing. There's a contradiction here. If January 1, 2021 is Friday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make January 1, 2022 a Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, if February 3, 2022 is Thursday, then January 1, 2022 is Friday. So which is correct? \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in one of the calculations. Let me check again. \n\nIf January 1, 2021 is Friday, then January 1, 2022 is 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Friday would be Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 is Saturday. \n\nBut according to the other calculation, if February 3, 2022 is Thursday, then January 1 is Friday. So which is correct? \n\nLet me check the number of days between January 1, 2022 and February 3, 2022. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 1 is day 32, February 2 is 33, February 3 is 34. So 34 days. \n\nIf January 1 is Saturday, then 34 days later is February 3. Let's calculate 34 days from Saturday. 34 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 6 days. So 4 weeks later is Saturday again, plus 6 days. Saturday + 6 days is Friday. So that would mean February 3 is Friday. But the problem says it's Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, this suggests that either the problem statement is wrong, or my assumption about January 1, 2022 is wrong. But the problem says that today is Thursday, February 3, 2022. So maybe the problem is correct, and my assumption about January 1, 2022 is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. \n\nIf January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then January 1 + 34 days is February 3. 34 days later. 34 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, 34-28=6. So 6 days after Saturday is Saturday + 6 days. Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday, +5 is Thursday, +6 is Friday. So February 3 would be Friday. But the problem says it's Thursday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. \n\nThis suggests that either the problem is incorrect, or my knowledge about January 1, 2022 is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let me check the actual day of the week for February 3, 2022. \n\nI can use an online calendar, but since I can't, I need to rely on other methods. \n\nAlternatively, I can check the day of the week for a known date. For example, I know that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Let me check that. \n\nIf March 1, 2022 is Tuesday, then February 28, 2022 is Monday (since March 1 is Tuesday, so February 28 is the day before, which is Monday). Then February 3 is 25 days before February 28. 25 days before. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So 3 weeks before is Monday, minus 4 days would be Monday - 4 days = Thursday. Wait, that would mean February 3 is Thursday. Which matches the problem statement. \n\nSo if March 1 is Tuesday, then February 28 is Monday. Then February 3 is 25 days before February 28. 25 days is 3 weeks (21 days) and 4 days. So 21 days before February 28 is February 28 - 21 days = February 7. Then subtract 4 more days: February 7 - 4 days is February 3. So if February 7 is Monday (since 21 days before is Monday), then February 3 is 4 days before Monday, which is Thursday."], [99, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Monday, October 3, 2022 to Tuesday, October 25, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each day.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. October 3, 2022 is a Monday. Then October 4 is Tuesday, 5 is Wednesday, 6 is Thursday, 7 is Friday. October 8 is Saturday, 9 is Sunday. Then October 10 is Monday again. So the week cycles every 7 days.\n\nSo from October 3 (Monday) to October 25 (Tuesday). Let me calculate the total days first. The difference between October 25 and October 3 is 22 days (since 25-3=22). But since both dates are inclusive, the total days would be 22 + 1 = 23 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have two dates, the number of days between them inclusive is (end date - start date) + 1. So October 3 to October 4 is 2 days (3 and 4). So October 3 to October 25 is 25 - 3 + 1 = 23 days. So total days is 23.\n\nNow, out of these 23 days, how many are weekends? Let's see. Let's list the dates and check which are weekends.\n\nStarting from October 3 (Monday):\n\nOctober 3: Monday (business)\n4: Tuesday (business)\n5: Wednesday (business)\n6: Thursday (business)\n7: Friday (business)\n8: Saturday (non-business)\n9: Sunday (non-business)\n10: Monday (business)\n11: Tuesday (business)\n12: Wednesday (business)\n13: Thursday (business)\n14: Friday (business)\n15: Saturday (non-business)\n16: Sunday (non-business)\n17: Monday (business)\n18: Tuesday (business)\n19: Wednesday (business)\n20: Thursday (business)\n21: Friday (business)\n22: Saturday (non-business)\n23: Sunday (non-business)\n24: Monday (business)\n25: Tuesday (business)\n\nWait, but October 25 is the end date. Let me check if that's correct. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nFrom October 3 to October 25 inclusive. Let me check how many weeks and days that is. October 3 is Monday. Let's see, each week has 5 business days and 2 weekends. Let's see how many full weeks are in the period.\n\nFrom October 3 to October 10 is 8 days (3-10). That's one full week (Monday to Sunday). But wait, October 3 is Monday, then October 4 is Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday. So from 3 to 10 is 8 days. So that's one week (7 days) plus one day. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of weeks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of weekends. Let's see. The first weekend is October 8 (Saturday) and 9 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is October 15 (Saturday) and 16 (Sunday). Then October 22 (Saturday) and 23 (Sunday). Then October 29 would be the next weekend, but that's beyond our date range. So in the period from October 3 to 25, there are three weekends: 8-9, 15-16, 22-23. Each weekend has 2 days, so 3*2=6 weekend days. So total business days would be total days (23) minus 6 weekend days, which is 17.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the weekends in the period. Let's list all the dates:\n\nOctober 3 (Mon) to October 25 (Tue). Let's check each Saturday and Sunday in this range.\n\nFirst Saturday: October 8 (Sat), Sunday 9. Then next Saturday is 15 (Sat), Sunday 16. Then next is 22 (Sat), Sunday 23. Then 29 (Sat) is beyond 25. So that's three weekends, 2 days each, 6 days total. So 23 total days minus 6 weekend days equals 17 business days. But wait, let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the business days directly. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays in the period.\n\nStarting from October 3 (Monday). Let's list each week:\n\nWeek 1: October 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri) \u2192 5 business days.\n\nWeek 2: October 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue), 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri). So the business days here are 10-14, which is 5 days.\n\nWeek 3: October 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun), 17 (Mon), 18 (Tue), 19 (Wed), 20 (Thu), 21 (Fri). Again, business days 17-21: 5 days.\n\nWeek 4: October 22 (Sat), 23 (Sun), 24 (Mon), 25 (Tue). So business days here are 24 and 25, which is 2 days.\n\nSo total business days: 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 17. That matches the previous calculation. So the answer should be 17.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the days from 3 to 25. Let's see:\n\nFrom 3 to 7 is 5 days (Mon-Fri). Then 8-9 are weekends. Then 10-14 is 5 days (Mon-Fri). Then 15-19 is 5 days (Mon-Fri). Then 20-21 is 2 days (Mon-Tue). Wait, but 22-23 are weekends. Then 24-25 is 2 days. Wait, but that's 5+5+5+2=17. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's calculate the total days (23) minus the number of weekends. The weekends are 8,9,15,16,22,23. That's 6 days. 23-6=17.

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates involved. The start date is February 10, 2022, which is a Thursday. The end date is March 12, 2022, which is a Saturday. The question says inclusive of both dates, so both the start and end dates are counted.\n\nI need to calculate the total number of days between these two dates and then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, I can count the business days directly by considering each week and the remaining days.\n\nLet me start by finding the total number of days between the two dates.

Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my knowledge. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. Let me think. Let's count the days from February 10 to March 12.\n\nFrom February 10 to February 28: February has 28 days. So from the 10th to the 28th inclusive. Let's calculate that. 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Wait, but that's from the 10th to the 28th inclusive. But wait, if I'm starting on the 10th, then the next day is 11th, so the number of days between the 10th and the 28th inclusive is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total days from February 10 to March 12 inclusive is 19 + 12 = 31 days. Wait, but that's the total days. But wait, maybe I should check that again. Let me think again.\n\nWait, February 10 to February 28: Let's count the days. From the 10th to the 28th. Let's subtract 10 from 28: 28 - 10 = 18 days, but since both start and end are inclusive, it's 18 + 1 = 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total days is 19 + 12 = 31 days.

Therefore, total business days would be total days (31) minus 9 weekends = 22 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because if there are 31 days total, and 9 weekends, then 31 - 9 = 22. But let me check if the count of weekends is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of weeks between the dates. Let's see. From February 10 (Thursday) to March 12 (Saturday). Let's see how many weeks and days that is.\n\nFrom February 10 to February 17 is 8 days (including both dates?), wait no. Wait, February 10 is day 1. Then February 11 is day 2, up to February 17 is day 8. Then February 18 is day 9. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the number of weekends. Let's see, in the list above, there are 9 weekend days. So 31 total days minus 9 weekends equals 22 business days. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the total days from February 10 to March 12 inclusive is 31 days. Let me check that again. Let's calculate the number of days between February 10 and March 12.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from February 10 to February 28 is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So 19 + 12 = 31 days. That's correct.\n\nNow, the weekends are 9 days. So 31 - 9 = 22. But wait, let me check the weekends again. Let me count again:\n\nFebruary 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), March 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), March 12 (Sat). That's 9 days. So yes, 9 weekends. So 31 - 9 = 22 business days.\n\nBut wait, another way to check: Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from February 10 (Thursday) which is a business day. Then each week has 5 business days. Let's see how many full weeks are in the period and then the remaining days.\n\nFrom February 10 to March 12 is 31 days. Let's divide 31 by 7. 7*4=28, so 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks would be 4*5=20 business days. Then the remaining 3 days are February 28 (Monday), March 1 (Tuesday), March 2 (Wednesday). Wait, but wait, the remaining days after 28 days (4 weeks) would be from day 29 to day 31. Wait, but the total is 31 days. Wait, if the first day is February 10 (Thursday), then adding 28 days would be February 10 + 28 days. Let me check: 28 days later is February 10 + 28 days. Since February has 28 days, adding 28 days would be March 10? Wait, no. Wait, February 10 plus 28 days is March 10? Wait, February has 28 days, so February 10 + 28 days would be March 10? Wait, no. Wait, February 10 plus 18 days is February 28 (since 28-10=18). Then adding 10 more days would be March 10. So 28 days later is March 10. But our end date is March 12. So from February 10 to March 10 is 28 days. Then March 11 and 12 are two more days. So the remaining days after 4 weeks (28 days) are March 11 and 12. Wait, but that's two days. Wait, maybe my previous calculation was wrong. Wait, 31 days total. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, then 3 days left. So the remaining days would be March 10 (the 29th day?), March 11 (30th), March 12 (31st). Wait, but that's three days. But according to the previous calculation, the end date is March 12. So maybe I need to check the exact dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the first day as Thursday, February 10. Then the next day is Friday, 11. Then Saturday 12, Sunday 13, Monday 14, Tuesday 15, Wednesday 16, Thursday 17, Friday 18, Saturday 19, Sunday 20, Monday 21, Tuesday 22, Wednesday 23, Thursday 24, Friday 25, Saturday 26, Sunday 27, Monday 28. Then March 1 is Tuesday, March 2 is Wednesday, March 3 is Thursday, March 4 is Friday, March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday, March 7 is Monday, March 8 is Tuesday, March 9 is Wednesday, March 10 is Thursday, March 11 is Friday, March 12 is Saturday.\n\nSo from February 10 (day 1) to March 12 (day 31). So the 28th day is March 10 (Monday). Then day 29 is March 11 (Tuesday), day 30 is March 12 (Wednesday?), wait no. Wait, March 10 is day 28. Then March 11 is day 29 (Tuesday), March 12 is day 30 (Wednesday)? Wait, but earlier when I listed the dates, March 12 was Saturday. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous list.\n\nWait, let me recheck the days. Let's start from February 10 (Thursday). Let's count each day step by step.\n\nDay 1: Feb 10 (Thu)\n\nDay 2: Feb 11 (Fri)\n\nDay 3: Feb 12 (Sat)\n\nDay 4: Feb 13 (Sun)\n\nDay 5: Feb 14 (Mon)\n\nDay 6: Feb 15 (Tue)\n\nDay 7: Feb 16 (Wed)\n\nDay 8: Feb 17 (Thu)\n\nDay 9: Feb 18 (Fri)\n\nDay 10: Feb 19 (Sat)\n\nDay 11: Feb 20 (Sun)\n\nDay 12: Feb 21 (Mon)\n\nDay 13: Feb 22 (Tue)\n\nDay 14: Feb 23 (Wed)\n\nDay 15: Feb 24 (Thu)\n\nDay 16: Feb 25 (Fri)\n\nDay 17: Feb 26 (Sat)\n\nDay 18: Feb 27 (Sun)\n\nDay 19: Feb 28 (Mon)\n\nDay 20: Mar 1 (Tue)\n\nDay 21: Mar 2 (Wed)\n\nDay 22: Mar 3 (Thu)\n\nDay 23: Mar 4 (Fri)\n\nDay 24: Mar 5 (Sat)\n\nDay 25: Mar 6 (Sun)\n\nDay 26: Mar 7 (Mon)\n\nDay 27: Mar 8 (Tue)\n\nDay 28: Mar 9 (Wed)\n\nDay 29: Mar 10 (Thu)\n\nDay 30: Mar 11 (Fri)\n\nDay 31: Mar 12 (Sat)\n\nWait, so March 12 is day 31, which is Saturday. So that's correct. So the remaining three days after 28 days (which is March 9, Wednesday) are March 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat). So those three days. So in the 4 weeks (28 days), there are 4*5=20 business days. Then the remaining three days (March 10, 11, 12) are Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So business days in those three days are Thursday and Friday (2 days), and Saturday is a weekend. So total business days would be 20 + 2 = 22. Which matches the previous calculation. So that's 22 business days.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 22.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because in the first approach, I counted 9 weekend days. 31 total days minus 9 weekends is 22 business days. So that's correct. So the answer is 22.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another method. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from February 10 (Thursday) as day 1 (business day). Then each week has 5 business days. Let's count the number of weeks and the remaining days.\n\nFrom February 10 to March 12 is 31 days. Let's see how many weeks and days that is. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days. Then 3 days left. So the first 28 days include 4 weeks, which is 4*5=20 business days. Then the remaining 3 days are March 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat). So in those three days, two business days (Thu and Fri) and one weekend (Sat). So total business days is 20 + 2 = 22.

Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week January 17, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because 2020 was a leap year, so January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2021 would be 365 days later, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding one day to Wednesday would make 2021 start on a Thursday? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 2020 was a leap year, so February had 29 days. So 2020 started on a Wednesday. Then 2021 would be 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2020 started on a Wednesday, then 2021 would start on a Thursday. Then 2022 would be 365 days after that, which is another 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on a Friday? Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm wrong here. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can check online, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me think of some other dates. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if that's the case, then maybe I can count backwards. Let's see. July 4 is Monday. Let's count the days between July 4 and January 17. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, if 2021 started on a Thursday, then 2022 would start on a Friday. So January 1, 2022 would be a Friday. But I thought earlier that it was a Saturday. Hmm, conflicting information. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me think of another known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if 2022 started on a Friday, then 2023 would start on a Saturday. Wait, but that's not matching. Wait, 2022 is 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2022 started on a Friday, then 2023 would start on a Saturday. But I thought that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So that's a problem. Therefore, my previous assumption must be wrong. So maybe 2022 started on a Saturday. Then 2023 would start on a Sunday. That matches. So that would mean that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Therefore, if that's correct, then January 17, 2022 would be 16 days later. Let's count. January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, and so on. Let's count 16 days. Since 7 days is a week, 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Saturday would be Monday. Wait, so January 17 would be a Monday? But wait, that seems conflicting with some other information. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think of another date. For example, I know that February 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, so January 16 is Sunday, and January 17 is Monday. That would make sense. So that would mean that January 17, 2022 was a Monday. But I need to confirm if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me try using Zeller's Congruence. The formula for Zeller's Congruence for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January is month 13 of the previous year, so for January 17, 2022, we need to adjust the month and year. So m = 13, and the year becomes 2021. Therefore, q = 17, m = 13, K = 21 (since 2021 mod 100 is 21), J = 20 (floor(2021 / 100) = 20).\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (17 + floor((13*(13 + 1))/5) + 21 + floor(21/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute floor((13*(13 + 1))/5). 13 + 1 is 14. 13*14 is 182. Divided by 5 is 36.4, so floor is 36.\n\nThen, floor(21/4) is 5 (since 21 divided by 4 is 5.25).\n\nfloor(20/4) is 5.\n\n5*20 is 100.\n\nSo adding all the terms:\n\n17 + 36 + 21 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 17 + 36 is 53, plus 21 is 74, plus 5 is 79, plus 5 is 84, plus 100 is 184.\n\nNow, 184 mod 7. Let's divide 184 by 7. 7*26 is 182, so 184 - 182 is 2. So h = 2.\n\nAccording to Zeller's Congruence, h=2 corresponds to Monday (since 0 is Saturday, 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday). Therefore, January 17, 2022 was a Monday. So that matches with my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer should be Monday.\n</think>", "Monday"], [99, "Count the occurrences of Thursday from Monday, December 26 to Friday, December 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Write the total number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Thursdays there are between December 26, 2022, and December 30, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out what day of the week each of these dates falls on. Let me start by checking what day December 26, 2022, was.\n\nWait, I remember that December 26, 2022, was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If I check a calendar, but since I can't actually look it up right now, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that December 25, 2022, was a Sunday. So December 26 would be a Monday. That's correct. So the start date is Monday, December 26.\n\nNow the end date is Friday, December 30. So the dates in question are Dec 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri). Wait, so from Dec 26 to Dec 30 inclusive, that's five days. Let me list them out:\n\n- Dec 26: Monday\n- Dec 27: Tuesday\n- Dec 28: Wednesday\n- Dec 29: Thursday\n- Dec 30: Friday\n\nSo in this range, there's only one Thursday, which is December 29. Therefore, the total number of Thursdays is 1. Wait, but maybe I should check if there's another one? Let me count again. The first day is Monday, so the next Thursday would be the 29th. Then the next one would be the 5th of January, but that's outside the range. So yes, only one Thursday in that period. So the answer should be 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the days. Let me verify again. If Dec 26 is Monday, then Dec 27 is Tuesday, Dec 28 Wednesday, Dec 29 Thursday, Dec 30 Friday. Yep, that's correct. So only one Thursday. So the answer is 1.\n</think>", "1"], [99, "In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. And I need to answer with the complete weekday name, like Monday, Tuesday, etc. Alright, so I need to figure out what day of the week April 3rd falls on if January 1st is a Wednesday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st.\" So maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year unless specified otherwise? Or maybe the problem is designed so that it doesn't matter? Wait, but if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't mention leap year, maybe I should assume it's a common year. But maybe I need to check both possibilities? Wait, but maybe the answer is the same regardless? Or maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Let me think. Let me check the number of days in each month.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to April 3rd, the number of days would be:\n\nJanuary: 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 30 days (since Jan 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Then March has 31 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from Jan 1 to April 3 is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 3 is 92 days. Wait, but wait, if I count from Jan 1 to April 3, inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is (April 3 - January 1) days. So let's calculate that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of days from January 1 to April 3. Let's do that step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is day 0. Then January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30. Then February has 28 or 29 days. Let's assume it's a non-leap year, so 28 days. Then February 28 is day 30 + 28 = 58. Then March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 58 + 31 = 89. Then April 1 is day 90, April 2 is 91, April 3 is 92. So total of 92 days from January 1 to April 3, inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is 92 days later. Wait, but how does that work? Let me check with a smaller example. If January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, so the number of days between January 1 and January 2 is 1 day. So the formula is (target date - start date) in days. So April 3 is 92 days after January 1. So the total number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 92 days. So then, since January 1 is a Wednesday, adding 92 days to that date will give me the day of the week for April 3.\n\nBut how do I calculate the day of the week? Well, since each week has 7 days, the day of the week will be (Wednesday + 92 days) mod 7. So 92 divided by 7 gives how many weeks and extra days. Let's compute 92 divided by 7. 7*13 is 91, so 92 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 92 days later is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday. So April 3 would be a Thursday? Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days between January 1 and April 3. Let me recount. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to day 30 + 28 = 58. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to day 58 + 31 = 89. Then April 1 is day 90, April 2 is 91, April 3 is 92. So yes, 92 days. So 92 days later. So 92 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 1. So 92 days is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday. So April 3 is a Thursday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's start from January 1 (Wednesday). Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Wednesday. Then January 8 is also Wednesday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Thursday, January 31 is Friday. So February 1 is Saturday. Then February has 28 days. So February 28 is 28 days later. Let's see, 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28 would be the same day as February 1, which is Saturday. So February 28 is Saturday. Then March 1 is Sunday. March has 31 days. So March 1 is Sunday. March 8, 15, 22, 29 are Sundays. Then March 30 is Monday, March 31 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is Wednesday. April 2 is Thursday, April 3 is Friday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. Wait, according to this, April 3 is Friday. But earlier calculation said Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. So where is the mistake?\n\nFirst approach: 92 days later is 13 weeks and 1 day. So Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday. But the second approach, step by step, gives Friday. So which is correct?\n\nLet me check the step-by-step again. Let's start from January 1 (Wednesday). Let's count the days:\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 2: Thursday\n\n...\n\nJanuary 7: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (so that's 7 days later, which is correct)\n\nThen January 8 is Wednesday. Then January 15 is Wednesday, 22, 29. Then January 29 is Wednesday. Then January 30 is Thursday, January 31 is Friday. So February 1 is Saturday. Then February has 28 days. So February 1 is Saturday. Then February 28 is 28 days later. Since 28 is 4 weeks, so February 28 is Saturday. Then March 1 is Sunday. March has 31 days. So March 1 is Sunday. Then March 7 is Sunday, 14, 21, 28. March 28 is Sunday. Then March 29 is Monday, March 30 is Tuesday, March 31 is Wednesday. Then April 1 is Thursday. April 2 is Friday, April 3 is Saturday. Wait, that's different again. Wait, now I'm confused. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the step-by-step.\n\nWait, let me recount March. If March 1 is Sunday, then March 1 is Sunday. Then March 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. So March 29 is Sunday. Then March 30 is Monday, March 31 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that's different from before. So April 1 is Wednesday. Then April 2 is Thursday, April 3 is Friday. So that would be Friday. But according to the first method, it's Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first method. Let me check the number of days again. Let me count the days from January 1 to April 3. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28 days, March 31 days, and April 3 days. Wait, but that would be 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. Wait, but that's if you count the days in each month. But if you start from January 1, then the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is (April 3 - January 1) days. So if January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is day 92. But if you count the days in each month, January has 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then Feb 28 days, March 31 days, and April 3 days. But that would be 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. But that's including the start and end dates? Wait, no. Wait, if you count from Jan 1 to Jan 31, that's 31 days. Then from Feb 1 to Feb 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 31 is 31 days. Then April 1 to April 3 is 3 days. So total days from Jan 1 to April 3 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. But that would mean that April 3 is 93 days after January 1. But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought it was 92 days. So which is correct?\n\nWait, the confusion is whether the number of days between Jan 1 and April 3 is 92 or 93. Let me think. If Jan 1 is day 0, then Jan 2 is day 1, ..., Jan 31 is day 30. Then Feb 1 is day 31, Feb 28 is day 31 + 28 - 1 = day 58. Then March 1 is day 59, March 31 is day 59 + 31 - 1 = day 89. Then April 1 is day 90, April 3 is day 92. So that's 92 days. But if you count the days in each month, adding them up, you get 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 93. But that's because when you add the days of each month, you are including the start of each month. So if you start from Jan 1 (day 0), then the next month's days are added. So the correct number of days between Jan 1 and April 3 is 92 days. So why is there a discrepancy in the step-by-step counting?\n\nWait, in the step-by-step counting, I had:\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday\n\nThen March 1 is Sunday. Then March 31 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is Wednesday. So April 1 is Wednesday. Then April 2 is Thursday, April 3 is Friday. So that would be 93 days from Jan 1? Because if April 1 is day 90, then April 3 is day 92. So that's 92 days. So if April 1 is Wednesday, then April 3 is Friday. So that would mean that the first method was wrong. Wait, but according to the first method, 92 days is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Wednesday would be Thursday. But according to the step-by-step, it's Friday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe the first method is wrong. Let me check the calculation again. 92 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 1. So 92 days is 13 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Wednesday, then adding 92 days would be Wednesday + 1 day = Thursday. But according to the step-by-step, it's Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the step-by-step is wrong. Let me check again. Let's start from January 1 (Wednesday). Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday (day 0)\n\nJanuary 2: Thursday (1)\n\nJanuary 3: Friday (2)\n\nJanuary 4: Saturday (3)\n\nJanuary 5: Sunday (4)\n\nJanuary 6: Monday (5)\n\nJanuary 7: Tuesday (6)\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (7) \u2192 7 days later, which is correct.\n\nSo January 8 is Wednesday. Then January 15 is Wednesday, 22, 29. So January 29 is Wednesday. Then January 30 is Thursday (day 30), January 31 is Friday (day 31). Then February 1 is Saturday (day 32). February has 28 days, so February 28 is day 32 + 27 = day 59. Wait, because day 32 is February 1, so day 32 + 27 = day 59 is February 28. Then March 1 is day 60. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 60 + 30 = day 90. Then April 1 is day 91, April 2 is day 92, April 3 is day 93. Wait, this is conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, this suggests that April 3 is day 93. But earlier, I thought that April 3 is day 92. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31. February 28 is day 31 + 28 - 1 = day 58. Then March 1 is day 59. March 31 is day 59 + 31 - 1 = day 89. Then April 1 is day 90, April 2 is 91, April 3 is 92. So that's 92 days. But in the step-by-step counting above, I thought that March 31 is day 90, which would be day 90. Then April 1 is day 91, April 2 is 92, April 3 is 93. So that's conflicting. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the confusion is in how we count the days. If January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31. So February 28 is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1 is day 59. March 31 is day 59 + 30 = day 89. Then April 1 is day 90. So April 3 is day 92. So that's 92 days. But in the step-by-step counting, when I counted March 1 as day 60, that must be wrong. Wait, why did I think March 1 is day 60? Because I added 31 days to day 31 (February 28) to get March 1. Wait, no. If February 28 is day 58, then March 1 is day 59. So March 1 is day 59. Then March 31 is day 59 + 30 = day 89. So April 1 is day 90. So April 3 is day 92. So that's correct. So why in the previous step-by-step counting did I get March 1 as day 60? That must have been a mistake. So let me redo the step-by-step counting correctly.\n\nStarting from January 1 (Wednesday, day 0):\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday (0)\n\nJanuary 2: Thursday (1)\n\n...\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (7)\n\nJanuary 15: Wednesday (14)\n\nJanuary 22: Wednesday (21)\n\nJanuary 29: Wednesday (28)\n\nJanuary 30: Thursday (29)\n\nJanuary 31: Friday (30)\n\nFebruary 1: Saturday (31)\n\nFebruary 2: Sunday (32)\n\n...\n\nFebruary 28: Saturday (31 + 27 = 58)\n\nMarch 1: Sunday (59)\n\nMarch 2: Monday (60)\n\n...\n\nMarch 7: Saturday (65)\n\nMarch 8: Sunday (66)\n\n...\n\nMarch 14: Saturday (71)\n\nMarch 15: Sunday (72)\n\n...\n\nMarch 21: Saturday (77)\n\nMarch 22: Sunday (78)\n\nMarch 28: Saturday (83)\n\nMarch 29: Sunday (84)\n\nMarch 30: Monday (85)"], [99, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 10 to Tuesday, June 14, 2022 (including both start and end dates). State the amount as a number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between April 10, 2022 (Sunday) and June 14, 2022 (Tuesday), inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down month by month. Let's check the dates. April 10 to April 30, then May 1 to May 31, then June 1 to June 14. \n\nFirst, let's check the start date: April 10, 2022 is a Sunday. So April 10 is a Sunday. Then April 11 is Monday, and so on. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check the actual calendar for 2022. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Wait, I remember that April 10, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. For example, April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Then April 4 was Monday, so April 10 would be 6 days later. April 1: Friday, April 2: Saturday, April 3: Sunday, April 4: Monday, April 5: Tuesday, April 6: Wednesday, April 7: Thursday, April 8: Friday, April 9: Saturday, April 10: Sunday. Yes, that's correct. So April 10 is Sunday.\n\nNow, the end date is June 14, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let me check that. Let's see, May has 31 days. Let's count the days from April 10 to June 14. \n\nFirst, April 10 to April 30: that's 21 days (since April 10 is day 1, April 30 is day 21). Wait, April 10 to April 11 is 2 days, so April 10 to April 30 is 30 - 10 + 1 = 21 days. Wait, 30 - 10 is 20, plus 1 is 21. So 21 days in April. Then May has 31 days, so May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. Wait, but wait, if April 10 is day 1, then adding 21 days would take us to April 30. Then May has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to May 31. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total days is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. But wait, that's if we include both start and end dates. Wait, but when you add the days, if you have April 10 to April 30 inclusive, that's 21 days. Then May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. So total days between April 10 and June 14 inclusive is 66 days. \n\nNow, I need to find how many of those are weekdays (Monday-Friday). So the total days is 66. Now, the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period would be 66 minus the number of weekdays. But how to calculate the number of weekends?\n\nAlternatively, since the start date is a Sunday, maybe I can count the number of Sundays and Saturdays in the period. Let's see. \n\nFirst, April 10 is Sunday. Then April 11 is Monday. So the first week starts on April 10 (Sunday) and ends on April 16 (Saturday). Then April 17 is Sunday again. So each week has 2 weekend days (Sunday and Saturday). But since the start is Sunday, the first week has 2 weekend days. Then the next weeks would have 2 each. But need to check how many weeks and extra days there are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weekends by checking how many full weeks there are and then the remaining days. Let's see. \n\nTotal days: 66. Let's divide by 7. 66 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 3 days. Because 9*7=63, so 66-63=3. So 9 full weeks and 3 days. In each full week, there are 2 weekend days (Sunday and Saturday). So 9 weeks would have 9*2=18 weekend days. Then the remaining 3 days are April 10 (Sunday), April 11 (Monday), April 12 (Tuesday). Wait, no. Wait, the total days are 66. If the first day is Sunday (April 10), then the 63 days would be 9 weeks. Then the remaining 3 days would be day 64: Sunday (April 10 + 63 days is April 10 + 63 days. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Wait, the total days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is 66 days. So if I start on day 1 (April 10, Sunday), then day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, day 3 is Tuesday, day 4 is Wednesday, day 5 is Thursday, day 6 is Friday, day 7 is Saturday, day 8 is Sunday, etc. So each week is 7 days. So 66 days is 9 weeks (63 days) plus 3 days. So the first 63 days would be 9 weeks, and the remaining 3 days would be days 64, 65, 66. \n\nSo day 64 would be the same as day 1 (Sunday), day 65 is Monday, day 66 is Tuesday. Wait, but the end date is June 14, which is Tuesday. So the last day is day 66, which is Tuesday. So the remaining 3 days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. \n\nSo in the 9 weeks, there are 9*2=18 weekend days. Then in the remaining 3 days, the first day is Sunday (a weekend day), the second is Monday (weekday), third is Tuesday (weekday). So that's 1 weekend day. So total weekend days are 18 + 1 = 19. Therefore, the number of weekdays is total days (66) minus weekend days (19) = 47. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because if the first day is Sunday, then in each week, the first day is Sunday, so the weekend days are Sunday and Saturday. So in each week, there are two weekend days. So 9 weeks would have 18. Then the remaining 3 days are Sunday (day 64), Monday (day 65), Tuesday (day 66). So that's one Sunday (weekend) and two weekdays. So total weekend days are 18 + 1 = 19. So total weekdays would be 66 - 19 = 47. \n\nBut wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in the period. Let's try that approach. \n\nStarting from April 10 (Sunday). Let's find the first Saturday. April 10 is Sunday, so April 11 is Monday, April 12 is Tuesday, April 13 is Wednesday, April 14 is Thursday, April 15 is Friday, April 16 is Saturday. So the first Saturday is April 16. Then the next Saturday is April 23, 30, May 7, 14, 21, 28, June 4, 11, 18, 25. Then the next Saturday would be July 2, but that's beyond our period. So let's count all Saturdays between April 10 and June 14. \n\nApril 16, 23, 30 (three Saturdays in April). Then May 7, 14, 21, 28 (four Saturdays in May). Then June 4, 11, 18, 25. But June 14 is the end date. So June 4, 11 are within the period. June 18 is after June 14. So in June, there are two Saturdays (June 4 and 11). So total Saturdays: 3 (April) + 4 (May) + 2 (June) = 9 Saturdays. \n\nNow Sundays. April 10 is Sunday. Then the next Sundays are April 17, 24, May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Then June 5, 12, 19, 26. But the end date is June 14. So Sundays in the period are April 10, 17, 24, May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Then June 5 and 12 are within the period. June 19 is after June 14. So that's 8 Sundays in April and May, plus two in June? Wait, let's count:\n\nApril 10 (Sunday), 17, 24 (three Sundays in April). Then May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (five Sundays in May). Then June 5, 12 (two Sundays in June). So total Sundays: 3 + 5 + 2 = 10. \n\nSo total weekend days are 9 Saturdays + 10 Sundays = 19. Which matches the previous calculation. Therefore, total weekdays are 66 - 19 = 47. \n\nBut wait, the start date is April 10 (Sunday) and end date is June 14 (Tuesday). So the total days are 66. But when I count the weekends, I have 19. So 66-19=47. \n\nBut let me check again. Let's take a small example. For example, from April 10 (Sunday) to April 11 (Monday). That's two days. Weekdays are Monday (1 day). Weekends are Sunday (1 day). So 2-1=1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: April 10 (Sunday) to April 16 (Saturday). That's 7 days. Weekends are Sunday (1), Saturday (1). So 2 weekend days. Weekdays are 5. 7-2=5. Correct. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 47. \n\nBut wait, let me check again the count of Sundays and Saturdays. \n\nSaturdays: April 16, 23, 30 (three), May 7, 14, 21, 28 (four), June 4, 11 (two). Total 3+4+2=9. Correct. \n\nSundays: April 10, 17, 24 (three), May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (five), June 5, 12 (two). Total 3+5+2=10. Correct. \n\nTotal 9+10=19. \n\nTotal days 66. 66-19=47. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is 47.\n</think>", "47"], [99, "What day of the week was December 20, 2022?

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can use as a reference. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because January 1, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2022 would be a year later, so adding 365 days. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, if 2021 started on Monday, then 2022 starts on Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday? Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 2021 started on a Monday. So January 1, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2022 would be 365 days later. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding one day to Monday would make it Tuesday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday? But I think I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I know that December 21, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that December 20, 2022 is a certain day. Wait, but I need to figure it out. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 20, 2022 is the same as December 20, 2023, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that I know some other dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then 2022 would be one day earlier. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday? Wait, but that contradicts the previous thought. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to find a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to calculate it manually. Let me try again. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, July 4, 2022. Let me think. July 4, 2022. If I can remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards from there. Let's see. July 4 is Monday. Then July 11 is Monday, July 18, July 25. Then August 1 is Monday. Wait, but that would mean that August 1, 2022 was a Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. Then August 8 is Monday, and so on. Then August 15, 22, 29. Then September 5, 12, 19, 26. October 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. November 7, 14, 21, 28. December 5, 12, 19, 26. So December 26, 2022 was a Monday. Then December 20 would be 6 days before that. So December 26 is Monday. December 25 is Sunday, 24 is Saturday, 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday, 21 is Wednesday, 20 is Tuesday. So that would mean December 20, 2022 was a Tuesday. But wait, if that's the case, then December 26 is Monday. But I'm not sure if July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Maybe I should check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's take a date that I know for sure. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 20 would be 5 days before. So December 25 is Sunday. Then December 24 is Saturday, 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday, 21 is Wednesday, 20 is Tuesday. So that would make December 20 a Tuesday. But I need to confirm if December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, I think that's correct. Because 2022 was a year where Christmas was on a Sunday. Let me think. If that's the case, then December 20 would be Tuesday. But I need to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if that's the case, then December 31, 2022 was a Saturday. Then December 31, 2022 is Saturday. Then December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday, 25 is Sunday. So that would make December 25 a Sunday. Then December 20 would be 5 days before that, which is Tuesday. So that's consistent. Therefore, December 20, 2022 was a Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [99, "Is 2014 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2014 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2014 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2014 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2014 minus 2000 is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3.5. So that's not a whole number. Wait, so 2014 divided by 4 is 503.5, which means it's not divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, if a year isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. But just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's any exception here. \n\nBut wait, the exception is for century years. Century years are those divisible by 100, like 1900, 2000, 2100, etc. So 2014 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. 2014 divided by 100 is 20.14, so no. Therefore, since it's not a century year, the only condition is divisibility by 4. Since 2014 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me check again. 4 times 500 is 2000. 2014 minus 2000 is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 2. So yes, 2014 divided by 4 is 503 with a remainder of 2. So definitely not divisible by 4. Therefore, 2014 is not a leap year. \n\nSo the answer should be No.\n</think>", "No"], [99, "In a year where Sunday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 11. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find out what day of the week April 11th is, given that January 1st is a Sunday. Hmm, I need to figure out the number of days between January 1st and April 11th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are in each month from January to April. January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think we can assume it's not a leap year. So February has 28 days. March has 31 days, and April has 30 days. But we need the days up to April 11th.\n\nSo starting from January 1st (Sunday), let's count the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is day 0 (Sunday). Then, the next day, January 2nd is day 1 (Monday), and so on. But maybe it's easier to calculate the total days from January 1st to April 11th.\n\nWait, the total days from January 1st to April 11th would be:\n\nJanuary: 31 days, but since we start on January 1st, the days in January after that would be 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the number of days between January 1st and April 11th inclusive? Or exclusive?\n\nActually, if January 1st is day 0 (Sunday), then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So to find April 11th, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1st and April 11th, then take that number modulo 7 to find the day of the week.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. But since we start on January 1st, the number of days from January 1st to April 11th is:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (but since we start on day 0, maybe we need to subtract 1? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1st is day 0 (Sunday), then January 1st is day 0, January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 30 + 28 = day 58. Then March has 31 days, so March 31st is day 58 + 31 = day 89. Then April 11th is 11 days after March 31st, so day 89 + 11 = day 100.\n\nWait, but if January 1st is day 0, then the total days from January 1st to April 11th is 100 days. Then, since each week has 7 days, 100 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder gives the day of the week.\n\nSo 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 2 days (since 14*7=98, 100-98=2). So day 0 is Sunday, then day 1 is Monday, day 2 is Tuesday. Therefore, April 11th would be Tuesday?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because if January 1st is Sunday (day 0), then adding 1 day (day 1) is Monday, day 2 is Tuesday, etc. So if the total days from January 1st to April 11th is 100 days, then April 11th is 100 days after January 1st. But since day 0 is January 1st, then day 1 is January 2nd, so day 100 would be 100 days after January 1st. So the number of days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days. So 100 mod 7 is 2. So adding 2 days to Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 is Tuesday. So April 11th is Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total days. Let me check again.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1st. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1st. Then April 11th is 11 days after April 1st. So total days from January 1st to April 11th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 11 is 101 days. Wait, that's 101 days. But earlier I thought it was 100. Which is correct?\n\nWait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31. February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. March 1st is day 59. March 31st is day 59 + 30 = day 89. Then April 1st is day 90. April 11th is day 90 + 10 = day 100. Wait, that's 100 days. But when I added the months, I got 31 + 28 + 31 + 11 = 101. But that's because when you add the days, you have to be careful. Because from January 1st to April 11th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) days? Wait, no. Wait, if you count the days from January 1st to April 11th inclusive, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 101 days. But if you count the days between January 1st and April 11th, not including January 1st, then it's 100 days. But since the problem says that January 1st is Sunday, and we need to find the day of the week for April 11th, which is 100 days after January 1st. Because if January 1st is day 0, then April 11th is day 100. So the total days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days. So 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 2 days. So 2 days after Sunday is Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the days. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1st. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1st. Then April 11th is 11 days after April 1st. So total days from January 1st to April 11th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 11 is 101. But that's if we count the days from January 1st to April 11th inclusive. However, if January 1st is day 0, then the next day is day 1, so the number of days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days. Because if you have 101 days including both start and end, then the number of days between them is 100. So which is correct?\n\nWait, the problem is that when you count the number of days between two dates, inclusive or exclusive. For example, if you have January 1st (day 0) and January 2nd (day 1), the number of days between them is 1 day. So if you have January 1st to April 11th, the number of days between them is 100 days. Because if you have 101 days including both, then the difference is 100 days. So the correct way is to calculate the total days from January 1st to April 11th as 100 days. Therefore, 100 days later is the day of the week.\n\nSo 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 2 days after Sunday is Tuesday. Therefore, April 11th is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is Sunday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Sunday. Then January 8th is Sunday again (7 days later). January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then January 30th is Monday, January 31st is Tuesday. So February 1st is Wednesday. Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is 28 days after January 1st. Let's see, 28 days is 4 weeks, so February 28th is also a Wednesday. Then March 1st is Thursday. March has 31 days. So March 1st is Thursday. March 8th is Thursday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then March 30th is Friday, March 31st is Saturday. Then April 1st is Sunday. Then April 1st is Sunday. Then April 8th is Sunday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. So April 11th is two days after April 9th. Wait, April 1st is Sunday. April 2nd is Monday, April 3rd is Tuesday, April 4th is Wednesday, April 5th is Thursday, April 6th is Friday, April 7th is Saturday, April 8th is Sunday, April 9th is Monday, April 10th is Tuesday, April 11th is Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. So according to this step-by-step, April 11th is Wednesday. But earlier calculation said Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, so where is the mistake here?\n\nLet me check again. Let's start from January 1st as Sunday.\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\n\nJanuary 2: Monday\n\n...\n\nJanuary 7: Saturday\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday\n\nJanuary 15: Sunday\n\nJanuary 22: Sunday\n\nJanuary 29: Sunday\n\nThen January 30: Monday\n\nJanuary 31: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 1: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 2: Thursday\n\n...\n\nFebruary 28: Wednesday (since 28 days is 4 weeks, so same day as February 1st)\n\nMarch 1: Thursday\n\nMarch 2: Friday\n\nMarch 3: Saturday\n\nMarch 4: Sunday\n\nMarch 5: Monday\n\nMarch 6: Tuesday\n\nMarch 7: Wednesday\n\nMarch 8: Thursday\n\nMarch 9: Friday\n\nMarch 10: Saturday\n\nMarch 11: Sunday\n\nMarch 12: Monday\n\nMarch 13: Tuesday\n\nMarch 14: Wednesday\n\nMarch 15: Thursday\n\nMarch 16: Friday\n\nMarch 17: Saturday\n\nMarch 18: Sunday\n\nMarch 19: Monday\n\nMarch 20: Tuesday\n\nMarch 21: Wednesday\n\nMarch 22: Thursday\n\nMarch 23: Friday\n\nMarch 24: Saturday\n\nMarch 25: Sunday\n\nMarch 26: Monday\n\nMarch 27: Tuesday\n\nMarch 28: Wednesday\n\nMarch 29: Thursday\n\nMarch 30: Friday\n\nMarch 31: Saturday\n\nApril 1: Sunday\n\nApril 2: Monday\n\nApril 3: Tuesday\n\nApril 4: Wednesday\n\nApril 5: Thursday\n\nApril 6: Friday\n\nApril 7: Saturday\n\nApril 8: Sunday\n\nApril 9: Monday\n\nApril 10: Tuesday\n\nApril 11: Wednesday\n\nSo according to this step-by-step, April 11th is Wednesday. But earlier calculation said Tuesday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nThe problem is in the initial calculation of the number of days between January 1st and April 11th. Let me check that again.\n\nIf January 1st is day 0 (Sunday), then April 11th is day 100. But according to the step-by-step, April 11th is Wednesday. Let's check what day of the week that would be. If day 0 is Sunday, then day 1 is Monday, day 2 Tuesday, day 3 Wednesday. So day 3 is Wednesday. So if April 11th is day 100, then 100 mod 7 is 2 (since 7*14=98, 100-98=2). So day 2 is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step, April 11th is Wednesday. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the calculation of the number of days. Let me count the days again. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 11th.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1st. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1st. Then April 11th is 11 days after April 1st. So total days from January 1st to April 11th is 31 + 28 + 31 + 11 = 101 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then April 11th is day 100. Wait, but if you count the days from January 1st to April 11th inclusive, that's 101 days. But if you count the number of days between January 1st and April 11th, not including January 1st, then it's 100 days. So the confusion is whether the total days is 100 or 101.\n\nBut in the step-by-step, April 11th is Wednesday. Let's check what day of the week that would be. If January 1st is Sunday, then April 11th is Wednesday. So the number of days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days. Because 100 days later would be 100 mod 7 = 2, which would be Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step, it's Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the step-by-step. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 11th.\n\nJanuary 1st is Sunday.\n\nJanuary 1st to January 31st is 31 days. So January 31st is day 30 (since day 0 is Jan 1st). Then February 1st is day 31. February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. March 1st is day 59. March has 31 days, so March 31st is day 59 + 30 = day 89. April 1st is day 90. April 11th is day 90 + 10 = day 100. So day 100 is April 11th. So day 100 mod 7 is 100 / 7 = 14*7=98, remainder 2. So day 2 is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step, April 11th is Wednesday. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the step-by-step is wrong. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 11th.\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday (day 0)\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday (day 7)\n\nJanuary 15: Sunday (day 14)\n\nJanuary 22: Sunday (day 21)\n\nJanuary 29: Sunday (day 28)\n\nFebruary 5: Sunday (day 35)\n\nFebruary 12: Sunday (day 42)\n\nFebruary 19: Sunday (day 49)\n\nFebruary 26: Sunday (day 56)\n\nMarch 5: Sunday (day 63)\n\nMarch 12: Sunday (day 70)\n\nMarch 19: Sunday (day 77)\n\nMarch 26: Sunday (day 84)\n\nApril 2: Sunday (day 91)\n\nApril 9: Sunday (day 98)\n\nApril 16: Sunday (day 105)\n\nSo April 9 is day 98 (Sunday). Then April 10 is Monday ("], [99, "Between Tuesday, January 25, 2022 and Tuesday, March 29, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Give the count numerically.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between January 25, 2022, and March 29, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me check the dates. Let's start by finding the total number of days between the two dates.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate the number of days between two dates? Well, I can use a calendar or maybe break it down into months. Let's see. January 25 to January 31 is 7 days (including the 25th). Then February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. Wait, but adding those up: 7 (Jan 25-31) + 28 (Feb) + 29 (Mar 1-29) = 7 + 28 is 35, plus 29 is 64 days total. Wait, but that's from Jan 25 to March 29 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if I take Jan 25 to Jan 31, that's 7 days (since 31-25+1=7). Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days would be 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 25, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let me check what day of the week March 29, 2022, is. Wait, maybe that's helpful. But maybe I can just calculate the total days. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that from Jan 25 to March 29 is 64 days. But I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to compute it manually. Let's see. January has 31 days. So from Jan 25 to Jan 31 is 31 - 25 + 1 = 7 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days is 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 64 days.\n\nNow, I need to find how many of those are business days. So subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period.\n\nBut how many weekends are there? Well, first, I need to know the days of the week for the start and end dates. Since the start date is Tuesday, January 25, 2022. Let me check what day of the week March 29, 2022, is. Wait, maybe I can calculate that.\n\nJanuary 25 is a Tuesday. Let's count the days. Let's see, January 25 is Tuesday. Then January 26 is Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So January 31 is a Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is a Tuesday (since 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so same day of the week as February 1). Then March 1 is a Wednesday. Then March 2 is Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday, 7 Tuesday, etc. So March 29: Let's count from March 1 (Wednesday). March 1 is Wednesday. March 8 is Wednesday, 15, 22, 29. So March 29 is a Wednesday. Wait, that's interesting. So March 29 is a Wednesday. So the start date is Tuesday, Jan 25, and end date is Wednesday, March 29. So the total period is 64 days, starting on Tuesday and ending on Wednesday.\n\nNow, to find the number of weekends in this period. Let's think about how many weeks there are and the extra days. Since 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day (since 9*7=63, so 64-63=1). Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. But if the start date is Tuesday, then the first week would be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Then the next week starts on Tuesday again. So if the total days are 64, then there are 9 full weeks (63 days) plus 1 day. But since the start date is Tuesday, the 63 days would end on Monday (since 63 days later is 9 weeks, so same day of the week as the start date. Wait, no. Wait, if you start on Tuesday, adding 7 days is the same day. So 63 days later is Tuesday again. Wait, but 63 days is 9 weeks. So if the start date is Tuesday, then 63 days later is also Tuesday. Then the 64th day is the next day, which is Wednesday. Which matches the end date. So the total period is 9 weeks (63 days) plus 1 day (Wednesday). So in those 9 weeks, there are 9 weeks * 2 weekends (Saturday and Sunday) = 18 weekends. Then the extra day is Wednesday, which is a business day. So total weekends would be 18. Therefore, total business days would be 64 - 18 = 46. Wait, but wait, that seems too straightforward. But maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but maybe the number of weekends isn't exactly 9*2. Because depending on how the weeks are structured. Let me check again. Let's think of the first week: from Jan 25 (Tuesday) to Jan 31 (Monday). That's 7 days. In that week, the weekends are Saturday (Jan 29) and Sunday (Jan 30). So that's 2 days. Then the next week is Feb 1 (Tuesday) to Feb 7 (Monday). Again, weekends are Saturday (Feb 5) and Sunday (Feb 6). So 2 days. Then each week after that would have 2 weekends. So for 9 weeks, that's 9*2=18. But wait, the total days are 64, which is 9 weeks (63 days) plus 1 day. So the 63 days would be 9 weeks, and the 64th day is the next day, which is Wednesday. So the 63 days would include 9 weeks, each with 2 weekends. So 18 weekends. Then the 64th day is a Wednesday, which is a business day. Therefore, total business days would be 64 - 18 = 46. But wait, that seems low. Wait, 64 days total, minus 18 weekends, gives 46 business days. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in the period. Let's try that. Starting from Jan 25 (Tuesday). Let's list the dates and see which are weekends.\n\nFirst, Jan 25 is Tuesday. The first weekend in January would be Jan 29 (Saturday) and Jan 30 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is Feb 5 (Saturday) and Feb 6 (Sunday). Then Feb 12, 13; Feb 19, 20; Feb 26, 27. Then March 4, 5; March 11, 12; March 18, 19; March 25, 26. Wait, but March 29 is the end date. So March 25 and 26 are weekends. Then March 29 is a Wednesday. So let's count all the Saturdays and Sundays in the period.\n\nFirst, Jan 29 (Sat), Jan 30 (Sun) \u2192 2 days.\n\nThen Feb 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun) \u2192 2.\n\nFeb 12, 13 \u2192 2.\n\nFeb 19, 20 \u2192 2.\n\nFeb 26, 27 \u2192 2.\n\nMarch 4, 5 \u2192 2.\n\nMarch 11, 12 \u2192 2.\n\nMarch 18, 19 \u2192 2.\n\nMarch 25, 26 \u2192 2.\n\nSo that's 9 weekends (each pair is 2 days). Wait, that's 9 * 2 = 18 days. So that's the same as before. So total weekends are 18. Therefore, business days are 64 - 18 = 46. But wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Wait, but how many weekends are there in total?\n\nWait, from Jan 29 to March 26, that's 9 weekends. Let me count the number of weekends. Let's see:\n\nFirst weekend: Jan 29-30 (2 days)\n\nSecond: Feb 5-6 (2)\n\nThird: Feb 12-13 (2)\n\nFourth: Feb 19-20 (2)\n\nFifth: Feb 26-27 (2)\n\nSixth: March 4-5 (2)\n\nSeventh: March 11-12 (2)\n\nEighth: March 18-19 (2)\n\nNinth: March 25-26 (2)\n\nThat's 9 weekends, each with 2 days. So 18 days. So total weekends are 18. So 64 total days minus 18 weekends is 46 business days. But wait, but the end date is March 29, which is a Wednesday. So March 26 is a Sunday, March 27 is Monday, March 28 is Tuesday, March 29 is Wednesday. So the last weekend is March 25-26. So that's correct. So the total is 18 weekends. Therefore, 64-18=46 business days. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have a period that starts and ends on different days, you might have to adjust. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of business days by counting the number of weeks and the extra days. Since the period starts on Tuesday and ends on Wednesday, and there are 64 days. So 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day. Each week has 5 business days. So 9 weeks would be 9*5=45 business days. Then the extra day is Wednesday, which is a business day. So total business days would be 45 +1=46. That matches the previous calculation. So that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 46.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me take a smaller example. Suppose from Tuesday to the next Tuesday, which is 8 days. That's 2 weeks. So 2*5=10 business days. But the total days are 8. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, if you have two weeks, that's 14 days. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Wait, if you have 7 days, that's one week. So 7 days would be 5 business days. Then 8 days would be 5 + 1 (the next day, which is a business day if it's a Monday). Wait, but if the first day is Tuesday, then the next day is Wednesday, etc. So 8 days would be from Tuesday to the next Monday. Wait, that's 8 days. So the first week is Tuesday to Monday (7 days), which is 5 business days. Then the 8th day is Tuesday again. Wait, no. Wait, if you start on Tuesday, then the 8th day is the next Tuesday. So the 8 days would be Tuesday (day 1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Saturday (5), Sunday (6), Monday (7), Tuesday (8). So in that case, the weekends are days 5 (Sat) and 6 (Sun). So 2 weekends. So business days are 8 - 2 = 6. Which is 5 (from first week) + 1 (the next Tuesday). So that's correct. So the formula of weeks * 5 + extra days (if they are business days) works. So in the case of 64 days, which is 9 weeks (63 days) and 1 day. So 9*5=45, plus 1 day (Wednesday) which is business. So 46. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 46. But wait, I need to make sure that the total days between the two dates is indeed 64. Let me check again. January 25 to January 31 is 7 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. 7 + 28 is 35, plus 29 is 64. Yes. So that's correct. So the total days is 64. So 64 - 18 = 46. So the answer is 46. But wait, I think I remember that in some cases, when the start and end dates are on the same day of the week, the calculation might be different. But in this case, the start is Tuesday and the end is Wednesday, so the total days is 64. So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 46.\n</think>", "46"], [99, "If a meeting is scheduled on the last Saturday of December 2022, on which day of the month does it occur? Give the count numerically.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up the calendar for December 2022. But since I can't actually look it up right now, I need to calculate it. Let me think. Let's start by knowing that December has 31 days. The last day of December is December 31. So if I can figure out what day of the week December 31 is, then I can work backwards to find the last Saturday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the first Saturday in December and then count the weeks. Wait, but December has 31 days. Let me think. Let's start by figuring out the day of the week for December 1. If I can confirm that, then I can count the days.\n\nWait, I think I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. For example, if I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday, then December 1 would be 20 days earlier. Let's count: 20 days before December 21. Let's see, 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So subtracting 6 days from Wednesday would be Thursday. Wait, that would mean December 1 is a Thursday. So that seems correct. So December 1 is Thursday.\n\nSo if December 1 is Thursday, then the first Saturday would be December 3 (since 1 is Thursday, 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday). Then the next Saturdays would be 10, 17, 24, and 31. Wait, December 31 would be a Saturday? Let me check. Let's count the days from December 1 (Thursday) to December 31. December has 31 days, so 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Thursday would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. Wait, that would mean December 31 is a Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, if December 1 is Thursday, then December 8 is also Thursday, 15, 22, 29. Then December 30 would be Friday, December 31 would be Saturday. So that's correct. So the last Saturday of December 2022 is December 31. Therefore, the answer is 31. But wait, let me check again. Because if December 1 is Thursday, then the first Saturday is the 3rd. Then adding 7 days each time: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. So December 31 is a Saturday. So that's the last Saturday. Therefore, the answer is 31. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for December 1. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So December 31, 2022, would be the day before, which would be Saturday. So that confirms that December 31, 2022, was a Saturday.

Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. Wait, maybe I should check a different known date. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. July 4, 2022: if I count the days from a known date. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I go back from there. Let's see. If January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be Saturday. Because the next day after December 31 is January 1. So December 31, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, November 15, 2022 is earlier in the year. Let me count the days between November 15 and December 31.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to count backwards. Let's see. Let's take December 31, 2022 as Saturday. Then December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 Tuesday, 26 Monday, 25 Sunday. Then December 24 is Saturday, 23 Friday, 22 Thursday, 21 Wednesday, 20 Tuesday, 19 Monday, 18 Sunday. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of days between November 15 and December 31, then subtract that from the known day.\n\nSo November has 30 days. So from November 15 to November 30 is 15 days (since 30 - 15 = 15). Then December has 31 days. So total days from November 15 to December 31 is 15 + 31 = 46 days. Wait, but if I go from November 15 to November 30, that's 15 days later. Then December 1 to December 31 is 31 days. So total 15 + 31 = 46 days. So November 15 is 46 days before December 31. Since December 31 is a Saturday, then November 15 would be 46 days earlier. Now, since each week has 7 days, 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 4 days. So 46 days before would be 6 weeks (which is 42 days) minus 4 days. So if I subtract 4 days from Saturday, that would be Saturday minus 4 days. Let's count: Saturday minus 1 day is Friday, minus 2 is Thursday, minus 3 is Wednesday, minus 4 is Tuesday. So November 15 would be a Tuesday? Wait, but that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that November 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if that's the case, then November 15 would be a Tuesday. But how do I confirm that? Wait, maybe I can check another date. Let me think. For example, if I know that November 15, 2022 was a Tuesday, then November 14 would be Monday. But how do I know that? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then December 31, 2022 is Saturday. Then, let's count the days from November 15 to December 31. Let me count the days step by step. November has 30 days. So from November 15 to November 30 is 16 days (including both start and end?), no, wait. Wait, if I start on November 15, then November 15 is day 0. Then November 16 is +1, etc. So from November 15 to November 30 is 15 days later (since 30 - 15 = 15). Then December has 31 days. So total days from November 15 to December 31 is 15 + 31 = 46 days. So 46 days later is December 31. So if December 31 is Saturday, then November 15 is 46 days before that. Now, 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks (42 days) and 4 days. So 46 days before is 6 weeks and 4 days before. So if I subtract 4 days from Saturday, that would be Saturday minus 4 days. Let's count: Saturday (0), Friday (-1), Thursday (-2), Wednesday (-3), Tuesday (-4). So November 15 would be a Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But I need to make sure that my initial assumption that December 31, 2022 is a Saturday is correct. Because if that's wrong, then the whole calculation is off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is Monday, then July 5 is Tuesday, and so on. Let me count the days from July 4 to November 15. Let's see. July has 31 days. So from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (31 - 4 = 27). Then August has 31 days, September 30, October 31, November 15. So total days from July 4 to November 15 is 27 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 15 (November) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 15 is 134 days. So 134 days after July 4 is November 15. If July 4 is Monday, then adding 134 days. Let's divide 134 by 7. 7*19=133, so 134 is 19 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Monday is Tuesday.

what day of the week was it 58 days ago? Provide the full name of the weekday.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking what day of the week it was 58 days ago, given that today is Friday, March 11, 2022. I need to figure out the day by counting back 58 days from today. \n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 58 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks with a remainder. 7 times 8 is 56, so 58 minus 56 is 2. So that means 58 days ago is the same as 8 weeks and 2 days ago. Since 8 weeks is exactly 56 days, subtracting that from 58 leaves 2 days. \n\nSo if today is Friday, March 11, 2022, then 56 days ago would also be a Friday. Then subtracting 2 more days from Friday would be Thursday and Wednesday. Wait, so 58 days ago would be two days before Friday. Let me check that again. If today is Friday, then one day before is Thursday, two days before is Wednesday. So 58 days ago would be Wednesday? \n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this by checking the actual dates. Let me try to count backwards. Let's start from March 11, 2022. March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 58 days. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, subtract 56 days (8 weeks) to get to March 11 minus 56 days. March 11 minus 28 days is March 1 (since March has 31 days, 11-28 would be negative, so maybe I should subtract 28 days from March 11. Wait, March 11 minus 28 days would be February 11, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, March 11 minus 28 days. Let me think. March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 28 days would be March 11 minus 28 days. Let's count backwards. March 11 minus 1 day is March 10, minus 2 days is March 9, and so on. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of months. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should subtract 58 days step by step. Let's see. Let's start from March 11, 2022. Let's subtract 58 days. Let's first subtract 56 days (8 weeks) to get to March 11 minus 56 days. Since 56 days is 8 weeks, that would be March 11 minus 56 days. Let me check what date that is. \n\nMarch has 31 days. So March 11 minus 28 days is February 11, 2022. Then subtract another 28 days would be January 11, 2022. Wait, but 28 days before March 11 is February 11? Wait, March 11 minus 28 days. Let me check. March 11 minus 28 days. Let's count backwards. March 11 minus 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from March 11. March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 28 days would be February 11 (since March 11 minus 28 days is February 11, because March 11 minus 28 days is 28 days before March 11. Wait, maybe I should think of it as March 11 minus 28 days. Let's take March 11 minus 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from March 11. March 11 minus 28 days would be February 11, 2022. Because March 11 minus 28 days is February 11. Then subtract another 28 days would be January 11, 2022. So 56 days before March 11 is January 11, 2022. \n\nSo then, 58 days ago would be 56 days ago (January 11) plus 2 more days. So January 11 plus 2 days is January 13. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, if 56 days ago is January 11, then 58 days ago would be 56 days ago minus 2 days. So January 11 minus 2 days is January 9. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I messed up the direction. \n\nWait, if today is March 11, 2022, then 56 days ago is January 11, 2022. Then 58 days ago would be 56 days ago minus 2 days, which is January 9, 2022. But then, what day of the week was that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the day of the week. Since 56 days is exactly 8 weeks, so the day of the week would be the same. So if today is Friday, then 56 days ago was also a Friday. Then 58 days ago is two days before that. So Friday minus two days is Wednesday. So that would be Wednesday. \n\nBut wait, if I check the actual date, maybe I can confirm. Let me check what day January 9, 2022 was. Wait, I don't remember, but maybe I can calculate it. Alternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for January 11, 2022. If that's a Friday, then January 9 would be Wednesday. \n\nBut how do I know what day January 11, 2022 was? Well, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, let me check. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm. Wait, if that's the case, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, etc. So January 11 would be 10 days after January 1. January 1 is Saturday. January 1 + 7 days is January 8 (Saturday). Then January 9 is Sunday, January 10 is Monday, January 11 is Tuesday. Wait, that would mean that January 11, 2022 was a Tuesday. But that contradicts the earlier thought that 56 days ago (which is January 11) would be a Friday. Wait, that can't be. So there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, so if today is March 11, 2022, which is a Friday, then 56 days ago would be January 11, 2022. But if January 11, 2022 was a Tuesday, then that would mean that 56 days ago was Tuesday, but 56 days is 8 weeks, so that should be the same day. But according to my calculation, January 11 is Tuesday. So that would mean that 56 days ago (which is 8 weeks) would be Tuesday. But if today is Friday, then that would mean that 56 days ago was Tuesday, which is 3 days before Friday. That's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check. Wait, I think I need to verify the actual day of the week for January 1, 2022. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me check the day of the week for March 11, 2022. According to the problem, it's Friday. So if I can find the day of the week for January 11, 2022, then I can check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 11 is Friday. Let's count the days from January 11 to March 11. Let's see. January has 31 days, so January 11 to January 31 is 20 days. Then February has 28 days (since 2022 is not a leap year), so February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. So total days from January 11 to March 11 is 20 + 28 + 11 = 59 days. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if January 11 to January 31 is 20 days (since 31-11=20), then adding February 28 days (28) and March 11 days (11) would be 20 + 28 + 11 = 59 days. But that would mean that January 11 is 59 days before March 11. But according to the problem, March 11 is 58 days ago. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nWait, if I want to find the number of days between January 11 and March 11, inclusive or exclusive? Wait, if I want to find how many days between January 11 and March 11, then if I count from January 11 to March 11, that's 59 days. But if I want to find the number of days between January 11 and March 11, exclusive, then it's 58 days. Wait, but that depends on whether you count the start or end date. \n\nWait, if today is March 11, then 58 days ago would be January 11 minus 1 day? Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me think again. \n\nIf I want to find the date 58 days before March 11, 2022, I can subtract 58 days. Let's do that step by step. \n\nMarch 11 minus 58 days. Let's subtract 58 days. Let's break it down into months. \n\nMarch has 31 days. So March 11 minus 28 days is February 11 (since March 11 minus 28 days is February 11, because March 11 minus 28 days is 28 days before March 11. Wait, March 11 minus 28 days would be February 11. Then subtract another 28 days would be January 11. Wait, that's 56 days. So 56 days before March 11 is January 11. Then 58 days before would be 56 days before (January 11) minus 2 days, which is January 9. \n\nSo the date 58 days before March 11 is January 9, 2022. Now, if I can find out what day of the week January 9, 2022 was, then that's the answer. \n\nBut how do I find that? Well, if I know that March 11 is a Friday, then I can work backwards. Let's see. Let's count the days from January 9 to March 11. \n\nFrom January 9 to January 31 is 22 days (31-9=22). Then February has 28 days, so 28 days. Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. Total days from January 9 to March 11 is 22 + 28 + 11 = 61 days. Wait, but that's 61 days. But March 11 is 58 days after January 9. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm counting wrong. \n\nWait, if January 9 is the starting date, then January 10 is +1 day, ..., January 31 is 22 days later. Then February 1 is 23 days after January 9. Then February 28 is 23 + 28 = 51 days after January 9. Then March 1 is 52 days, March 11 is 52 + 10 = 62 days after January 9. Wait, that's 62 days. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So there's a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that 58 days before March 11 is January 9. So if March 11 is Friday, then January 9 is 58 days before. So 58 days is 8 weeks and 2 days. So 8 weeks before is the same day, so January 9 is 2 days before Friday. So that would be Wednesday. \n\nBut if I can check the actual day of the week for January 9, 2022, that would confirm. However, I don't remember that. But maybe I can use another method. Let's check the day of the week for January 1, 2022. \n\nI think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, if that's the case, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, etc. So January 9 would be Sunday. Wait, but that would mean that January 9 is Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, 58 days before March 11 (Friday) would be Wednesday. But that contradicts. So there's a problem here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check. \n\nWait, I can use an online calendar or some other method, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. \n\nI know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 2021 has 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be one day later in the week. So if January 1, 2021 was Friday, then January 1, 2022 would be Saturday. That seems correct. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. \n\nSo January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday (7 days later). January 9 is Sunday. January 10 is Monday. January 11 is Tuesday. So January 11 is Tuesday. Then, if 56 days before March 11 is January 11, which is Tuesday, then 58 days before would be two days before that, which is Sunday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. \n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try again. \n\nIf March 11 is Friday, then 56 days before is January 11, which is Tuesday. Then 58 days before is 56 days before (Tuesday) minus 2 days, which is Sunday. But according to the date calculation, January 9 is 58 days before March 11. But according to the day of the week, January 9 would be Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 9 is Sunday. So that would mean that 58 days ago was Sunday. But earlier, I thought that 58 days ago would be two days before Friday, which is Wednesday. But that's conflicting. \n\nWait, where is the mistake here? \n\nAh! Wait, the mistake is in the calculation of the number of days between January 9 and March 11. If January 9 is 58 days before March 11, then the number of days between January 9 and March 11 is 58 days. But when I calculated the days from January 9 to March 11, I got 62 days. That's a problem. So that suggests that my initial assumption that 58 days before March 11 is January 9 is wrong. \n\nSo let's recalculate the date 58 days before March 11. \n\nMarch 11 minus 58 days. Let's break it down. \n\nMarch has 31 days. So March 11 minus 58 days. Let's subtract 58 days step by step. \n\nFirst, subtract 28 days from March 11: March 11 - 28 days = February 11 (since March 11 minus 28 days is February 11). Then subtract another 28 days: February 11 - 28 days = January 11 (since February has 28 days in 2022, so February 11 minus 28 days is January 11). That's 56 days. So 56 days before March 11 is January 11. Then 58 days before is 56 days before (January 11) minus 2 days, which is January 9. \n\nBut according to the day count, from January 9 to March 11 is 62 days. So that suggests that there's a miscalculation here. \n\nWait, maybe I should count the days between January 9 and March 11. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 9 to January 31 is 31 - 9 = 22 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. So total days from January 9 to March 11 is 22 + 28 + 11 = 61 days. Wait, that's 61 days. But that would mean that January 9 is 61 days before March"], [99, "Name the day of the week for 10/16/2022. Give the weekday name in full.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 16, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because I remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days, so 2021 started on a Wednesday plus 366 days. Since 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days, so adding two days to Wednesday would make January 1, 2021 a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday plus 1 day, which is Saturday. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a perpetual calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me try another approach. Let's take a known date that I know for sure. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2021 had 365 days, so July 4, 2022 would be 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So July 4, 2022 would be a Tuesday? But I think that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the years. Alternatively, maybe I should check a specific date in 2022 that I know.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about the days in October. October has 31 days. Let's see, if I can find the day of the week for a known date in October 2022. For example, October 1, 2022. Wait, I think October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but how do I confirm that? Let me think. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then July has 31 days. Let's count the days from July 4 to October 1. July has 31 days, so July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October 1 is the first day. So total days from July 4 to October 1 is 27 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 1 (October 1) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 1 is 89 days. Wait, but that's from July 4 to October 1 inclusive? Wait, no. If July 4 is day 0, then July 5 is +1 day. So from July 4 to October 1 is 27 days in July (from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days?), wait July 4 to July 5 is 1 day, so July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since 31-4=27). Then August has 31 days, September 30, and October 1 is 1 day. So total days from July 4 to October 1 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 89 days. Wait, but that's if you include both July 4 and October 1. But if I want to find the number of days between July 4 and October 1, it's 89 - 1 = 88 days? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. If July 4 is day 0, then July 5 is +1, so July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since 31-4=27). Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to August 31. Then September has 30 days, so adding 30 days brings us to September 30. Then October 1 is 1 day. So total days from July 4 to October 1 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 89 days. But if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 89 days would be 89 days later. Since 89 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 5 days. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, but if that's the case, then October 1 is Saturday. Then October 2 is Sunday, October 3 is Monday, and so on. So October 16 would be 15 days after October 1. Let's count that. October 1 is Saturday. October 1 + 7 days is October 8 (Saturday), then October 15 is Saturday again. Then October 16 would be Sunday. Wait, but that would mean October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe my assumption that July 4, 2022 was a Monday is wrong. Let me check that again. If I can find another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, earlier I thought that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If 2021 started on a Friday (as I thought earlier), then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Then, let's count the days from January 1 to October 16. Let's break it down into months. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and then October 16. So let's calculate the total days from January 1 to October 16. Let's add up the days:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober: 16\n\nTotal days from January 1 to October 16 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 16. Let's compute that step by step.\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 30 (Jun) = 181\n181 + 31 (Jul) = 212\n212 + 31 (Aug) = 243\n243 + 30 (Sep) = 273\n273 + 16 (Oct) = 289 days.\n\nSo from January 1, 2022 (Saturday) to October 16, 2022 is 289 days. Now, to find the day of the week, we can divide 289 by 7 and find the remainder. Because each week has 7 days, so the remainder will tell us how many days ahead the date is from the starting day (Saturday).\n\n289 divided by 7: 7*41 = 287, so 289 - 287 = 2. So the remainder is 2. That means October 16 is 2 days after Saturday. Saturday + 1 day is Sunday, +2 days is Monday. Wait, but that would mean October 16 is a Monday? But earlier I thought it was Sunday. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the total days again. Let me add them again:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\nOctober: 16 (289). Yes, that's correct. So 289 days. 289 divided by 7 is 41 weeks and 2 days. So if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 2 days would be Monday. But earlier, when I thought October 1 was Saturday, then October 16 would be 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So October 1 (Saturday) + 1 day is Sunday. But that contradicts the other calculation. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a mistake here. Because when I calculated from January 1 to October 16, that's 289 days. But if January 1 is day 0 (Saturday), then day 1 is January 2, and so on. So the total number of days between January 1 and October 16 is 289 days. But the day of the week would be (starting day + 289 days) mod 7. However, since January 1 is day 0 (Saturday), then adding 289 days would be 289 mod 7. 289 divided by 7 is 41*7=287, remainder 2. So 2 days after Saturday is Monday. But according to the other method, if October 1 is Saturday, then October 16 is 15 days later, which is 15 mod 7 = 1 day, so Sunday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that October 1 is Saturday. Let me check that again. If January 1 is Saturday, then let's count the days to October 1. Let's calculate the number of days from January 1 to October 1. That would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 1 (Oct 1) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +31=212, +31=243, +30=273, +1=274 days. Wait, so from January 1 to October 1 is 274 days. Then 274 divided by 7 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Saturday, then October 1 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. Wait, but earlier I thought October 1 was Saturday. That was a mistake. So that's where the error was. So if October 1 is Sunday, then October 16 is 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 1 day is Monday. So that matches the other calculation. So October 16 would be Monday. But earlier, when I thought July 4 was Monday, I had a different result. So maybe that was wrong. So now, according to this, October 16 is Monday. But I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to verify. Alternatively, maybe I can check the actual calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on calculations. Let me try again.\n\nIf January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then let's check another date. For example, January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, etc. Let's check February 1, 2022. January has 31 days, so February 1 is 31 days after January 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So February 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Then March 1 is 28 days after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Tuesday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. April 1 is Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Friday + 2 days is Sunday. May 1 is Sunday. June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. June 1 is Wednesday. July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. July 1 is Friday. August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. Friday + 3 days is Monday. August 1 is Monday. September 1 is 31 days after August 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. Monday + 3 days is Thursday. September 1 is Thursday. October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday. Wait, but earlier when I calculated from January 1 to October 1 as 274 days, which is 274 mod 7 = 274 / 7 = 39*7=273, remainder 1. So 1 day after Saturday is Sunday. But according to this step-by-step calculation, October 1 is Saturday. There's a contradiction here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check the step-by-step again. Starting from January 1 (Saturday):\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\n\nFebruary 1: 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. Correct.\n\nMarch 1: 28 days after February 1. 28 mod 7 is 0. So same day, Tuesday. Correct.\n\nApril 1: 31 days after March 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. Correct.\n\nMay 1: 30 days after April 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Friday + 2 days is Sunday. Correct.\n\nJune 1: 31 days after May 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. Correct.\n\nJuly 1: 30 days after June 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. Correct.\n\nAugust 1: 31 days after July 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Friday + 3 days is Monday. Correct.\n\nSeptember 1: 31 days after August 1. 31 mod 7 is 3. Monday + 3 days is Thursday. Correct.\n\nOctober 1: 30 days after September 1. 30 mod 7 is 2. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday. But earlier calculation said that from January 1 to October 1 is 274 days, which is 274 mod 7 = 1. So if January 1 is Saturday, then October 1 should be Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. But according to the step-by-step, it's Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, the number of days from January 1 to October 1 is not 274. Because if January 1 is day 1, then October 1 is day 274. But if January 1 is day 0, then October 1 is day 273. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the counting. Let me clarify. If January 1 is day 0 (Saturday), then January 2 is day 1 (Sunday), and so on. So the number of days between January 1 and October 1"], [99, "What day of the week was November 28, 2022? Answer with the weekday's name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week November 28, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm. Wait, I think 2022 started on a Sunday. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because January 1, 2021 was a Friday? Wait, no, I need to be careful here. Maybe I should look up a reference point. But since I can't actually look it up, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count the days from there to November 28. Let's see. Let's break it down.\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September has 30, October has 31, and November 28. So adding those up:\n\nFrom July 4 to July 31: 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August is 31, September 30, October 31, and November 28. So total days from July 4 to November 28 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 28. Let me calculate that. 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 28 is 147 days. Wait, but that's from July 4 to November 28 inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if July 4 is day 0, then adding 27 days would take me to July 31. Then adding August (31 days) would take me to August 31, then September (30 days) to September 30, then October (31 days) to October 31, and then November 28 is 28 days into November. So total days from July 4 to November 28 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 28 = 147 days. But if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 147 days later would be November 28. Now, since 147 divided by 7 is 21 weeks exactly (7*21=147), so that would mean that November 28 is also a Monday. Wait, but that can't be right because if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 7 days would be the same day. So 147 days later would be the same day of the week. Therefore, November 28, 2022 would be a Monday. But wait, I'm not sure if July 4, 2022 was actually a Monday. Maybe I got that wrong. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another reference. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then I can count backward. Let's see. December 25 is Sunday. November has 30 days, so November 25 is 25 days before December 25. Wait, no, November 25 is 25 days before December 25? Wait, November has 30 days, so November 25 is 5 days before December 1. So December 25 is 30 days after November 25. Wait, maybe I should count the days from November 28 to December 25. Let's see. November 28 to November 30 is 2 days, then December 1 to December 25 is 25 days. So total 27 days. So if December 25 is Sunday, then November 28 would be 27 days before. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So subtracting 6 days from Sunday would be Monday. Wait, because Sunday minus 6 days is Monday? Wait, no. Let me think. If December 25 is Sunday, then December 24 is Saturday, 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday, 21 is Wednesday, 20 is Tuesday, 19 is Monday. Then November 30 is 25 days before December 25? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try again.\n\nIf December 25 is Sunday, then November 25 is 30 days before December 25. Wait, November has 30 days, so November 25 is 5 days before December 1. So November 25 is 30 days before December 25. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if December 25 is Sunday, then November 25 would be Sunday minus 2 days, which is Friday. Then November 28 is 3 days after November 25. So Friday + 3 days is Monday. Therefore, November 28 would be a Monday. So that matches the previous calculation. So that seems to confirm that November 28, 2022 was a Monday. But wait, I'm not sure if December 25, 2022 was actually a Sunday. Maybe I should check that. Wait, I think that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me think. For example, I know that December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Let me check that. If December 1 is Thursday, then December 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday, 5 is Monday, 6 is Tuesday, 7 is Wednesday, 8 is Thursday. Wait, that would make December 25 as 25 days after December 1. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So December 1 is Thursday, adding 4 days would be Monday. Wait, that would make December 25 a Monday? But that contradicts my previous thought. So now I'm confused. Maybe I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then 2022 was a leap year? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year. So January 1, 2023 is 365 days after January 1, 2022. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, because adding 1 day to Saturday would be Sunday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, let's check that. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, and so on. Let's check February 1, 2022. January has 31 days, so 31 days after January 1 is February 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday would be Tuesday. So February 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Then March 1 would be 28 days after February 1 (since 2022 is not a leap year). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Tuesday. Then April 1 is 28 days after March 1, which is also a Tuesday. Wait, but that can't be right because March has 31 days, so April 1 is 31 days after March 1. Wait, no, March 1 plus 31 days is April 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So if March 1 is Tuesday, then April 1 is Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me redo this.\n\nIf January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is 28 days after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. So April 1, 2022 is Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Friday + 2 days is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then June 1 is 31 days after May 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. June 1 is Wednesday. July 1 is 30 days after June 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. July 1 is Friday. August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. Friday + 3 days is Monday. August 1 is Monday. September 1 is 31 days after August 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. Monday + 3 days is Thursday. September 1 is Thursday. October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. October 1 is Saturday. November 1 is 31 days after October 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. November 1 is Tuesday. Then November 28 is 27 days after November 1. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. Therefore, November 28, 2022 is a Monday. So that seems to confirm it again. So according to this calculation, November 28, 2022 was a Monday. Therefore, the answer should be Monday.\n</think>", "Monday"], [99, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, August 14, 2022 to Sunday, October 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Write the total number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from August 14, 2022 (Sunday) to October 16, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the extra days. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down month by month. Let's check each month's days and count the business days.\n\nStarting with August. August 14 is a Sunday. Let's list the dates from August 14 to August 31. Wait, August has 31 days. So August 14 is Sunday. Then August 15 is Monday, 16 Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday, 20 Saturday, 21 Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo from August 14 to August 31, how many days? Let's calculate. August 14 to August 31 is 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days. Wait, 31 minus 14 is 17, plus 1 is 18 days. So 18 days in total. Now, how many of those are business days?\n\nAugust 14 is Sunday. So the first day is Sunday. Then the next days:\n\nAugust 14: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 15: Monday (business)\nAugust 16: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 17: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 18: Thursday (business)\nAugust 19: Friday (business)\nAugust 20: Saturday (non-business)\nAugust 21: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 22: Monday (business)\nAugust 23: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 24: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 25: Thursday (business)\nAugust 26: Friday (business)\nAugust 27: Saturday (non-business)\nAugust 28: Sunday (non-business)\nAugust 29: Monday (business)\nAugust 30: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 31: Wednesday (business)\n\nSo from August 14 to August 31, that's 18 days. Let's count the business days. Let's see:\n\nFrom August 15 to August 19: 5 days (Mon-Fri) \u2013 that's 5 business days.\n\nThen August 22-26: another 5 days (Mon-Fri) \u2013 5 more.\n\nThen August 29-31: 3 days (Mon, Tue, Wed) \u2013 3 business days.\n\nTotal for August: 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 business days. Wait, but wait, August 14 is Sunday, which is non-business. Then August 15 is Monday, so the first week has 5 business days (Mon-Fri). Then August 20 is Saturday, 21 Sunday, then August 22 is Monday again. So that's another 5 days (Mon-Fri). Then August 27 is Saturday, 28 Sunday, then August 29 is Monday again. So from 29 to 31 is three days. So 5 + 5 + 3 = 13. That seems right.\n\nNow moving to September. September has 30 days. Let's check the dates. The next month is September. The first day of September 2022 is a Monday? Wait, August 14 is Sunday. August 15 is Monday. So August 31 is a Wednesday. Then September 1 is Thursday. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, August 14 is Sunday. Then August 15 is Monday. Then August 16 is Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday, 20 Saturday, 21 Sunday, 22 Monday, 23 Tuesday, 24 Wednesday, 25 Thursday, 26 Friday, 27 Saturday, 28 Sunday, 29 Monday, 30 Tuesday, 31 Wednesday. So September 1 is Thursday. So September 1 is Thursday. So September has 30 days. So from September 1 to September 30.\n\nNow, how many business days in September? Well, since September 1 is Thursday, the first week of September has Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Wait, but business days are Monday-Friday. So in September, the first week (September 1-7) would have Thursday (non-business?), wait no. Wait, business days are Monday-Friday. So September 1 is Thursday (non-business?), but wait, no. Wait, Thursday is a business day. Wait, business days are Monday through Friday. So Thursday is a business day. So September 1 is Thursday (business), September 2 is Friday (business), September 3 is Saturday (non-business), September 4 is Sunday (non-business), September 5 is Monday (business), and so on.\n\nSo for September, the entire month has 30 days. Let's calculate the number of business days. Since September 1 is Thursday, the first week (Sep 1-7) has 5 business days (Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed? Wait, no. Wait, Sep 1 is Thursday. So Sep 1 (Thu), 2 (Fri), 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed). So business days in that first week are Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed. That's 5 days. Then the next weeks would be 5 business days each. But wait, September has 30 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. Wait, 4 weeks is 28 days, so 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So the first week (Sep 1-7) is 5 business days. Then the next three weeks (Sep 8-28) would be 3 weeks, each with 5 business days. Then the last two days (Sep 29-30) would be business days. Wait, but let me check.\n\nWait, Sep 1 is Thursday. So the first week (Sep 1-7) has 5 business days. Then Sep 8 is Thursday again. So each week after that would be 5 business days. So 4 weeks would be 28 days. Then the remaining two days are Sep 29 and 30. Let's check what day they are. Sep 29 would be the next day after Sep 28. Let's see, Sep 28 is a Wednesday (since Sep 7 is Wednesday, then adding 21 days (3 weeks) would be Sep 28, which is Wednesday again. Then Sep 29 is Thursday, Sep 30 is Friday. So those two days are business days. So total business days in September would be 5 (first week) + 3*5 (next three weeks) + 2 (last two days) = 5 + 15 + 2 = 22? Wait, but wait, 4 weeks would be 28 days. So 4 weeks would be 4*5=20 business days? Wait, no. Wait, each week has 5 business days. So 4 weeks would be 4*5=20. Then the remaining two days (Sep 29 and 30) are two business days. So total 20 + 2 = 22. But wait, the first week is 5 business days, then the next three weeks (Sep 8-28) is 3 weeks, which is 15 business days. Then the last two days (Sep 29-30) is 2. So 5 + 15 + 2 = 22. That's correct. So September has 22 business days.\n\nNow moving to October. The problem says up to October 16, 2022. So October 16 is a Sunday. Let's check the dates. October 1, 2022 is a Saturday? Wait, let me check. Wait, September 30 is a Friday. So October 1 is a Saturday. Then October 2 is Sunday, October 3 is Monday, and so on. So October 1 is Saturday, 2 Sunday, 3 Monday, 4 Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, 11 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 13 Thursday, 14 Friday, 15 Saturday, 16 Sunday. So October 16 is Sunday. So from October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. But we need to count the business days from August 14 to October 16 inclusive. Wait, but we already counted August and September. Now, October is from October 1 to October 16. But we need to check how many business days are in October from October 1 to October 16.\n\nSo October 1 is Saturday (non-business), October 2 is Sunday (non-business), October 3 is Monday (business), October 4 Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, 11 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 13 Thursday, 14 Friday, 15 Saturday, 16 Sunday.\n\nSo from October 1 to October 16, that's 16 days. Let's count the business days. The first two days (Oct 1 and 2) are non-business. Then from Oct 3 to Oct 7 (5 days: Mon-Fri) \u2013 5 business days. Then Oct 8-9 are non-business. Then Oct 10-14 (5 days: Mon-Fri) \u2013 5 business days. Then Oct 15 is Saturday (non-business), Oct 16 is Sunday (non-business). So total business days in October would be 5 + 5 = 10 days.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. From October 3 to 7: 5 days. Then October 10 to 14: 5 days. That's 10 days. So total 10 business days in October. But wait, October 16 is included. But October 16 is Sunday, which is non-business. So the total for October is 10 business days.\n\nSo adding up the business days:\n\nAugust: 13\n\nSeptember: 22\n\nOctober: 10\n\nTotal: 13 + 22 = 35, plus 10 is 45. So 45 business days?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total days between the two dates and subtract the weekends. Let's try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days from August 14 to October 16 inclusive. Let's calculate that.\n\nAugust has 31 days. So from August 14 to August 31 is 18 days (as before). Then September has 30 days, and October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So total days is 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days. Wait, but wait, August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. Then September is 30 days, so adding that gives 18 + 30 = 48 days. Then October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So total is 48 + 16 = 64 days. So total days is 64. Now, how many weekends are in these 64 days?\n\nBut how to calculate the number of weekends. Since the start date is Sunday (August 14), and the end date is Sunday (October 16). Let's check how many weeks there are. 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day (since 9*7=63, so 64 is 63 +1). But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, since the start and end are both Sundays, the number of weekends would be the number of Saturdays and Sundays in the period.\n\nAlternatively, since the first day is Sunday, and the last day is Sunday. Let's think of the total days as 64. The number of weekends would be the number of Saturdays and Sundays. Let's see.\n\nIn a period that starts on Sunday and ends on Sunday, the number of weekends depends on the total days. For example, if there are 7 days, that's one week, with one Sunday and one Saturday. But if there are 8 days, that's one week plus one day (Sunday again). So in that case, two Sundays and one Saturday. Wait, but the first day is Sunday, then the next day is Monday, etc. So for 8 days: days 1-7 are a week (Sunday to Saturday), day 8 is Sunday again. So in that case, two Sundays and one Saturday. So the number of weekends would be (total days + 6) // 7 * 2 - something? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nAlternatively, since the start is Sunday, the first day is Sunday. Let's count the number of Sundays and Saturdays in the period.\n\nFrom August 14 (Sunday) to October 16 (Sunday). Let's find how many Sundays and Saturdays are in between.\n\nFirst, August 14 is Sunday. Then the next Sundays are August 21, 28, September 4, 11, 18, 25, October 2, 9, 16. Let's count them. August 14, 21, 28 (3 Sundays in August). Then September 4, 11, 18, 25 (4 Sundays in September). Then October 2, 9, 16 (3 Sundays in October). Total Sundays: 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 Sundays.\n\nNow Saturdays. The first Saturday is August 20. Then August 27, September 3, 10, 17, 24, October 1, 8, 15. Let's count them. August 20, 27 (2 in August). September 3, 10, 17, 24 (4 in September). October 1, 8, 15 (3 in October). Total Saturdays: 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 Saturdays.\n\nSo total weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are 10 + 9 = 19 days. Therefore, the total business days would be total days (64) minus weekends (19) = 64 - 19 = 45. Which matches the previous calculation. So that's 45 business days. So the answer should be 45.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because when I calculated the business days per month, I had August 13, September 22, October 10, totaling 45. So that's correct. So the answer is 45.\n\nBut wait, let me check the total days again. August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. September 1 to September 30 is 30 days. October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. 18 + 30 + 16 = 64. Correct. Then weekends are 19. 64 - 19 = 45. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check the number of Sundays and Saturdays again.\n\nSundays:\n\nAugust 14, 21, 28 (3)\n\nSeptember 4, 11, 18, 25 (4)\n\nOctober 2, 9, 16 (3)\n\nTotal 3+4+3=10. Correct.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nAugust 20, 27 (2)\n\nSeptember 3, 10, 17, 24 (4)\n\nOctober 1, 8, 15 (3)\n\nTotal 2+4+3=9. Correct. 10+9=19. So 64-19=45. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 45.\n</think>", "45"], [99, "Count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week it was 70 days before Friday, September 2, 2022. Let me start by understanding the problem. The question is asking to count backward 70 days from that date and find the corresponding weekday. The answer should be the full weekday name, like Monday, Tuesday, etc.\n\nFirst, I should confirm the date in question. The starting point is Friday, September 2, 2022. Let me check if that's correct. Wait, September 2, 2022, was indeed a Friday. Let me verify that. Well, I can check a calendar or use some method to confirm. But since I don't have a calendar here, I'll have to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then, adding days to get to September 2. But maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 70 days is exactly 10 weeks (since 7 days per week). Wait, 70 divided by 7 is 10. So 70 days is exactly 10 weeks. Therefore, if I subtract 70 days from September 2, 2022, it should be the same day of the week, right? Because subtracting a multiple of 7 days would land on the same weekday.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. However, maybe there's a catch here. Wait, maybe the problem is not as simple as that. Because sometimes when you subtract days, depending on the month's length, the day might not be exactly the same. But if 70 days is exactly 10 weeks, then regardless of the months, subtracting 70 days would land on the same weekday. So if September 2 is a Friday, then subtracting 70 days would also be a Friday. But that seems too easy. However, maybe the problem is designed to test that understanding. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if 70 days is indeed exactly 10 weeks. 7 times 10 is 70, so yes. So subtracting 70 days would be the same day of the week. Therefore, the answer would be Friday. But wait, the question says \"count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022\". So if I subtract 70 days, that would be the same day of the week. Therefore, the answer is Friday. But maybe I need to check if there's any leap year or something affecting the days? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year. So February had 28 days. But since we're dealing with September, which is after February, the leap year doesn't affect this. So the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should verify by actually counting the days. Let me try that. Let's start from September 2, 2022, which is a Friday. Let's subtract 7 days: September 2 minus 7 days is August 26, 2022. That's also a Friday. Then subtract another 7 days: August 19, 2022. Also Friday. Continuing this way, each 7-day subtraction would land on the same day. So after 10 times 7 days, which is 70 days, the date would be September 2 minus 70 days. Let me calculate that date.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So September 2 minus 70 days. Let's break it down. Let's subtract 70 days step by step. Let's first subtract 30 days from September 2. That would be August 2, 2022. Then subtract another 30 days: July 2, 2022. Then subtract another 10 days: June 22, 2022. Wait, but that's 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, 30 days from September 2 is August 2 (since September has 30 days, so September 2 minus 30 days is August 2). Then another 30 days would be July 2. Then another 10 days would be June 22. Wait, but that's 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. So the date would be June 22, 2022. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should subtract 70 days from September 2. Let's think in terms of months. Let's subtract 70 days. Let's start by subtracting 30 days (September 2 - 30 days = August 2). Then subtract another 30 days (August 2 - 30 days = July 2). Then subtract 10 days (July 2 - 10 days = June 22). So total 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. So the date would be June 22, 2022. Now, I need to check what day of the week that was. But if September 2 is a Friday, then subtracting 70 days (which is 10 weeks) would be the same day. So June 22, 2022, should also be a Friday. But maybe I should check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's check the day of the week for June 22, 2022. Let me think. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, no. Wait, July 1, 2022, was a Friday? Let me check. Wait, July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then June 22 would be 9 days before July 1. Let me count. July 1 is Friday. Then June 22 is 9 days before. Let's count backward: June 22 (Monday?), June 23 (Tuesday), June 24 (Wednesday), June 25 (Thursday), June 26 (Friday), June 27 (Saturday), June 28 (Sunday), June 29 (Monday), June 30 (Tuesday), July 1 (Wednesday). Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I should use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if September 2 is a Friday, then July 1, 2022, is 60 days before September 2. Let me check that. From July 1 to August 31 is 60 days (July has 31 days, August has 31 days, so 31 + 31 = 62 days. Wait, that's not right. Wait, July 1 to July 31 is 30 days (since July 1 is day 1, July 31 is day 31, so 30 days later). Then August 1 to August 31 is another 31 days. So July 1 to August 31 is 30 + 31 = 61 days. Then September 1 is 62 days after July 1. So September 2 is 63 days after July 1. Therefore, if September 2 is a Friday, then July 1 is 63 days before. 63 days is 9 weeks (63/7=9). So July 1 would be a Friday as well. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. So if July 1 is a Friday, then June 22 is 9 days before July 1. Let me count that again. July 1 is Friday. Then June 22 is 9 days before. Let's count backward:\n\nJuly 1 (Friday) minus 1 day is June 30 (Thursday)\nminus 2: June 29 (Wednesday)\nminus 3: June 28 (Tuesday)\nminus 4: June 27 (Monday)\nminus 5: June 26 (Sunday)\nminus 6: June 25 (Saturday)\nminus 7: June 24 (Friday)\nminus 8: June 23 (Thursday)\nminus 9: June 22 (Wednesday)\n\nWait, so June 22 would be a Wednesday? But that contradicts the earlier idea that subtracting 70 days (which is 10 weeks) would land on the same day. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, so if September 2 is a Friday, then July 1 is 63 days before, which is 9 weeks (63 days) before. So July 1 would be a Friday. Then June 22 is 9 days before July 1, which would be a Wednesday. But according to the 70-day subtraction, June 22 is 70 days before September 2, which should be a Friday. But according to this, it's a Wednesday. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, my initial assumption that subtracting 70 days would land on the same day is wrong. Why is that?\n\nAh, because maybe the number of days between the two dates is not exactly 70 days. Wait, but I thought that subtracting 70 days from September 2 would be June 22. Let me check that again. Let me count the days between September 2 and June 22. Wait, September 2 minus 70 days. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So September 2 minus 30 days is August 2. Then August has 31 days, so August 2 minus 31 days is July 1. Then July 1 minus 10 days is June 21. Wait, that's 30 + 31 + 10 = 71 days. Wait, that's 71 days. So that's not correct. So my previous calculation was wrong. So maybe I made a mistake in the date calculation. Let me redo that.\n\nStarting from September 2, 2022. Subtract 70 days. Let's break it down into months.\n\nFirst, subtract 30 days to get to August 2 (since September has 30 days). Then subtract another 30 days to get to July 2 (August has 31 days, so August 2 minus 30 days is July 2). Then subtract another 10 days to get to June 22 (July 2 minus 10 days is June 22). Wait, that's 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. But that would mean that June 22 is 70 days before September 2. But when I calculated the days between July 1 and September 2, I thought that July 1 is 63 days before September 2. So if July 1 is 63 days before, then June 22 is 63 - 9 = 54 days before September 2? Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to calculate the exact number of days between June 22 and September 2.\n\nLet me calculate the days from June 22 to September 2. June has 30 days, so from June 22 to June 30 is 8 days. Then July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September 2 is 2 days. So total days: 8 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 72 days. Wait, that's 72 days. So that would mean that June 22 is 72 days before September 2. But that contradicts the previous calculation of 70 days. So there's a mistake here. Therefore, my initial calculation of the date was wrong. So where is the error?\n\nLet me try again. Let's subtract 70 days from September 2, 2022. Let's do it step by step.\n\nStart with September 2. Subtract 30 days: August 2 (since September has 30 days). Then subtract another 30 days: July 2 (August has 31 days, so August 2 minus 30 days is July 2). Then subtract 10 days: June 22 (July 2 minus 10 days is June 22). So that's 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. But when I calculated the days from June 22 to September 2, I got 72 days. That suggests that there's a miscalculation here. Let me check again.\n\nFrom June 22 to June 30: 30 - 22 = 8 days (June 23 to June 30 is 8 days, but if you include June 22, then it's 9 days? Wait, no. If you start on June 22 and go to June 23, that's 1 day. So from June 22 to June 30 is 8 days (June 22 to June 23 is 1 day, ..., June 22 to June 30 is 8 days). Then July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 31 is 31 days. Then August has 31 days, and September 2 is 2 days. So total days from June 22 to September 2 is 8 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 2 (September) = 72 days. So that's 72 days. Therefore, June 22 is 72 days before September 2. But I thought that subtracting 70 days would land on June 22. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, my initial calculation of the date was wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the subtraction. Let me try again. Let's subtract 70 days from September 2. Let's break it down into months.\n\nFirst, subtract 30 days: September 2 minus 30 days is August 2. Then subtract another 30 days: August 2 minus 30 days is July 2 (since August has 31 days, so August 2 minus 30 days is July 2). Then subtract another 10 days: July 2 minus 10 days is June 22. Wait, but that's 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. But according to the other calculation, June 22 is 72 days before September 2. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the way I'm counting the days. Let me check the number of days between June 22 and September 2. Let's count them step by step.\n\nJune 22 to June 30: 30 - 22 = 8 days (June 23 to June 30 is 8 days, but if you include June 22, then it's 9 days. Wait, no. If you start on June 22 and go to June 23, that's 1 day. So from June 22 to June 30 is 8 days (June 22 to June 23 is 1 day, ..., June 22 to June 30 is 8 days). Then July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 31 is 31 days. August has 31 days, so from August 1 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September 1 to September 2 is 2 days. So total days from June 22 to September 2 is 8 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 72 days. Therefore, June 22 is 72 days before September 2. Therefore, subtracting 70 days from September 2 would be 72 - 2 = 70 days before. So that would be June 22 minus 2 days, which is June 20. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, if June 22 is 72 days before September 2, then subtracting 2 days from June 22 would be June 20, which is 74 days before September 2. Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I need a better way to calculate the date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that 70 days is 10 weeks. So if September 2 is a Friday, then subtracting 70 days should be the same day. But according to the previous calculation, June 22 is 72 days before, which is 2 days more than 70. Therefore, that suggests that my initial assumption that subtracting 70 days would land on the same day is wrong. But why? Because maybe the number of days between the two dates is not exactly 70 days. Wait, but how can that be? If I subtract 70 days from September 2, it should be exactly 70 days before. But according to the calculation, it's 72 days. Therefore, there's a mistake in my date calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's use an online calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that, I need to think carefully. Let me try to count the days step by step.\n\nStarting from September 2, 2022 (Friday). Let's subtract 7 days: August 25, 2022 (Friday). Subtract another 7 days: August 18 (Friday). Subtract another 7: August 11 (Friday). Subtract 7: August 4 (Friday). Subtract 7: July 25 (Friday). Subtract 7: July 18 (Friday). Subtract 7: July 11 (Friday). Subtract 7: July 4 (Friday). Subtract 7: June 27 (Friday). Subtract 7: June 20 (Friday). So"], [99, "In a year where Saturday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 27. Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find out what day of the week March 27 falls on, given that January 1st is a Saturday. Hmm, I need to figure out the number of days between January 1st and March 27th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the months involved. January has 31 days, February has 28 or 29, and March has 31. But since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I should assume it's not a leap year. So February has 28 days.\n\nSo starting from January 1st (Saturday), I need to count the days up to March 27th. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. Since January 1st is a Saturday, January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. Wait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total days from January 1st to March 27th, then take modulo 7 to find the day of the week.\n\nSo total days in January after January 1st: 31 - 1 = 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 27 (Mar) = 85 days. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is day 0, then adding 30 days would take us to January 31st (since 30 days after January 1st is January 31st). Then adding 28 days would take us to February 28th, and then adding 27 days would take us to March 27th. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 30 + 28 + 27 = 85 days. But wait, that's 85 days after January 1st. But since January 1st is a Saturday, adding 85 days would give the day of the week.\n\nBut how does that work? Because each week has 7 days. So 85 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder gives the number of days ahead. So 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (84 days) with a remainder of 1 day. So 85 days later is 12 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1st is Saturday, then adding 1 day would be Sunday. Wait, but that would mean March 27th is a Sunday? But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1st as Saturday. Then January 1st is day 0 (Saturday). Then January 8th is also a Saturday (7 days later). Similarly, January 15th, 22nd, 29th are Saturdays. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th are Saturdays. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th are Saturdays. Wait, March 26th is a Saturday. Then March 27th is the next day, which would be Sunday. So that would mean March 27th is Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, 85 days later is 1 day ahead of Saturday, which is Sunday. So that seems to match. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days.\n\nWait, let me check the total days again. From January 1st to March 27th inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then adding 85 days would take us to day 85. But if I count the days between January 1st and March 27th, how many days is that?\n\nWait, for example, January 1st to January 2nd is 1 day later. So if I want to find the number of days between January 1st and March 27th, inclusive, it's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 27 (Mar) = 86 days. But if I'm starting from January 1st as day 0, then the next day is day 1. So the total days from January 1st to March 27th is 85 days later. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the number of days after January 1st. So if I have 85 days after January 1st, then the day of the week is (Saturday + 85 days). Since 85 divided by 7 is 12*7=84, remainder 1. So 85 days later is 1 day after Saturday, which is Sunday. So March 27th is Sunday. But according to the other way, counting the Saturdays, March 26th is Saturday, so March 27th is Sunday. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step. Let's take January 1st as Saturday. Then:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Then January 8th is Saturday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. So March 26th is Saturday. Then March 27th is Sunday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be Sunday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another approach. Let's count the number of days from January 1st to March 27th. Let's do that again. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1st. Then March 27th is 27 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 31 + 28 + 27 = 86 days. Wait, but that's 86 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then day 85 is March 27th. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. If January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31, and February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59. Then March 27th is day 59 + 26 = day 85. So that's 85 days after January 1st. So 85 days later. 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (84 days) and 1 day. So 1 day after Saturday is Sunday. So that's correct. Therefore, March 27th is Sunday. So the answer is Sunday.\n</think>", "Sunday"], [99, "On which weekday did October 8, 2022 fall? Provide the full name of the weekday.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 8, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Hmm, maybe I should verify that first. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think. If I can find a known date in 2022, maybe I can count forward or backward. Let me recall that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If I remember correctly, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So if that's the case, then October 8 would be 7 days later, which would also be a Saturday. Wait, but that can't be right because if October 1 is Saturday, then October 8 would be the next Saturday. But wait, that would mean October 8 is also a Saturday. But I think that's correct. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me think again. Let's count the days from October 1 to October 8. October 1 is Saturday. Then October 2 is Sunday, October 3 is Monday, October 4 is Tuesday, October 5 is Wednesday, October 6 is Thursday, October 7 is Friday, and October 8 is Saturday. So that would mean October 8, 2022 was a Saturday. But wait, I think I might be wrong here. Because sometimes when you count days, you have to be careful with the actual dates. Alternatively, maybe I can check another way. For example, if I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then adding 7 days would be the same day of the week. So October 8 would be the same as October 1, which is Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday. But wait, I think I might be confusing with another year. Let me check another way. Let me think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. July 4, 2022. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. Then August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. Then September 5 is Monday, September 12 is Monday, September 19 is Monday, September 26 is Monday. Then October 3 is Monday. So October 3 is Monday. Then October 4 is Tuesday, October 5 is Wednesday, October 6 is Thursday, October 7 is Friday, October 8 is Saturday. So that would mean October 8 is Saturday. So that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the answer is Saturday. But wait, I need to make sure that July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me think. I remember that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2022 would be one year later. Since 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So July 4, 2022 would be one day later than July 4, 2021. So if July 4, 2021 was a Monday, then July 4, 2022 would be a Tuesday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. So now I'm confused. Which is correct? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If July 4, 2021 was a Monday, then adding 365 days would be 52 weeks and 1 day. So July 4, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But earlier I thought that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. That's conflicting. So which is correct? Maybe I need to check another way. Let me think about another date. For example, I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. If that's correct, then July 4, 2022 would be 27 days earlier. Let's count. July has 31 days. So July 4 is 27 days before October 1. Let me calculate. From July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Wait, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days? Let me check. July 4 to July 5 is 1 day, so July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. So 27 days before October 1 is July 4. 27 days is 3 weeks and 6 days. So if October 1 is Saturday, then subtracting 3 weeks (21 days) would be the same day, Saturday. Then subtracting 6 more days would be Saturday minus 6 days. Saturday minus 1 day is Friday, minus 2 is Thursday, minus 3 is Wednesday, minus 4 is Tuesday, minus 5 is Monday, minus 6 is Sunday. So July 4 would be a Sunday. But that contradicts the previous thought that July 4, 2022 was a Tuesday. So now I'm really confused. Which is correct? Maybe I need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe I can check an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to think again. Let me try to use another approach. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If October 8 is Saturday, then October 1 is Saturday. Then October 8 is Saturday. Then October 1 is Saturday. Then November 1 is a Tuesday (since October has 31 days, so 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So October 1 is Saturday, November 1 is Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. Then November 1 is Tuesday. Then November 8 is Tuesday, November 15 is Tuesday, November 22 is Tuesday, November 29 is Tuesday. Then December 6 is Tuesday, December 13 is Tuesday, December 20 is Tuesday, December 27 is Tuesday. Then December 25 is two days before December 27, which would be Sunday. So that would mean December 25 is Sunday. So that's correct. So if December 25 is Sunday, then December 25 is Sunday. Then December 25 is Sunday. So that's correct. Then, if I go back to July 4, 2022. Let's see. Let's count from July 4 to December 25. Let's see, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 25. So total days from July 4 to December 25 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 25. Wait, that's not right. Wait, from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August is 31 days, September 30, October 31, November 30, and then December 25. So total days from July 4 to December 25 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 25. Wait, that's 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 30 is 149, plus 25 is 174 days. So 174 days from July 4 to December 25. Now, if July 4 is a Sunday, then 174 days later would be December 25. Let's check if that's correct. 174 divided by 7 is 24 weeks and 6 days. So 24 weeks is 168 days, so 174 - 168 = 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. But December 25 is supposed to be Sunday. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that July 4 is Sunday must be wrong. Therefore, my previous calculation that October 1 is Saturday must be wrong. So where is the mistake here? Let me check again. If December 25 is Sunday, then December 25 is Sunday. Let's count back from December 25. December 25 is Sunday. Then December 18 is Sunday, December 11 is Sunday, December 4 is Sunday. November 27 is Sunday, November 20 is Sunday, November 13 is Sunday, November 6 is Sunday, October 30 is Sunday, October 23 is Sunday, October 16 is Sunday, October 9 is Sunday, October 2 is Sunday. Then October 1 is Saturday. So that would mean October 1 is Saturday. Then October 8 is Saturday. But then, if October 1 is Saturday, then November 1 is Saturday + 31 days. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So November 1 is Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. Then November 1 is Tuesday. Then November 8 is Tuesday, November 15 is Tuesday, November 22 is Tuesday, November 29 is Tuesday. Then December 6 is Tuesday, December 13 is Tuesday, December 20 is Tuesday, December 27 is Tuesday. Then December 25 is two days before December 27, which is Tuesday minus 2 days is Sunday. So that's correct. So December 25 is Sunday. Therefore, October 1 is Saturday. So that's correct. Then, if July 4 is 27 days before October 1, which is 27 days earlier. So 27 days is 3 weeks and 6 days. So October 1 is Saturday. Subtract 3 weeks (21 days) is still Saturday. Then subtract 6 days: Saturday minus 6 days is Sunday (Saturday -1 is Friday, -2 Thursday, -3 Wednesday, -4 Tuesday, -5 Monday, -6 Sunday). So July 4 would be Sunday. But earlier calculation said that from July 4 to December 25 is 174 days, which is 24 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Sunday would be Saturday, but December 25 is Sunday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So where is the mistake? Wait, maybe the number of days between July 4 and December 25 is not 174. Let me recalculate. Let's count the days from July 4 to December 25. July 4 to July 31: 31 - 4 = 27 days. August has 31 days, September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 25. So from July 4 to December 25 is 27 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 25 (December) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 30 is 149, plus 25 is 174. So that's correct. So 174 days. But according to the previous calculation, if July 4 is Sunday, then 174 days later is Sunday + 6 days = Saturday, but December 25 is Sunday. Therefore, this suggests that July 4 is not Sunday. Therefore, there's a mistake in the assumption that October 1 is Saturday. But how? Because according to the December 25 calculation, October 1 is Saturday. So where is the error here? Maybe the error is in the assumption that October 1 is Saturday. Let me check another way. Let's take another known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So January 1, 2023 is Sunday. Then December 31, 2022 is Saturday. Because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days. 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023 is one day after December 31, 2022. So December 31, 2022 is Saturday. Then December 31 is Saturday. Then December 24 is Saturday minus 7 days, which is Saturday. Wait, no. December 24 is 7 days before December 31. So December 31 is Saturday, so December 24 is also Saturday. Then December 25 is Sunday. Which matches the previous calculation. So December 25 is Sunday. Then December 25 is Sunday. Then December 18 is Sunday, December 11 is Sunday, December 4 is Sunday. November 27 is Sunday, November 20 is Sunday, November 13 is Sunday, November 6 is Sunday, October 30 is Sunday, October 23 is Sunday, October 16 is Sunday, October 9 is Sunday, October 2 is Sunday. Then October 1 is Saturday. So that's correct. So October 1 is Saturday. Then July 4 is 27 days before October 1. So 27 days is 3 weeks and 6 days. So October 1 is Saturday. Subtract 3 weeks (21 days) is still Saturday. Then subtract 6 days: Saturday minus 6 days is Sunday. So July 4 is Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, that would make December 25 be Saturday, but we know it's Sunday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. So where is the mistake? Wait, maybe the number of days between July 4 and October 1 is not 27 days. Wait, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. But if July 4 is the first day, then July 5 is +1 day. So from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. So July 4 is day 0, July 5 is day 1, ..., July 31 is day 27. So October 1 is 27 days after July 4. Therefore, if July 4 is Sunday, then October 1 is Sunday + 27 days. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. Which matches the previous calculation. So October 1 is Saturday. Then from July 4 to December 25 is 174 days. So 174 days is 24 weeks and 6 days. So if July 4 is Sunday, then adding 24 weeks (168 days) is still Sunday. Then adding 6 days would be Sunday + 6 days = Saturday. But December 25 is Sunday. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that July 4 is Sunday must be wrong. Therefore, there's a mistake in the previous reasoning. So where is the error? Let me think again. If October 1 is Saturday, then July 4 is 27 days before. So 27 days is 3 weeks and 6 days. So if October 1 is Saturday, then July 4 is Saturday minus 6 days. Saturday minus 6 days is Sunday. Wait, Saturday minus 1 day is Friday, minus 2 is Thursday, minus 3 is Wednesday, minus 4 is Tuesday, minus 5 is Monday, minus 6 is Sunday. So July 4 is Sunday. But that leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in the assumption that October 1 is Saturday. But how? Because December 25 is Sunday, which is 25 days after December 25. Wait, no. Wait, December 25 is Sunday. Then December 25 is Sunday. Then December 18 is Sunday, December 11 is Sunday, December 4 is Sunday. November 27 is Sunday, November 20 is Sunday, November 13 is Sunday, November 6 is Sunday, October 30 is Sunday, October 23 is Sunday, October 16 is Sunday, October 9 is Sunday, October 2 is Sunday. Then October 1 is Saturday. So that's correct. So October 1 is Saturday. Then July 4 is 27 days before. So if July 4 is Sunday, then October 1 is Sunday + 27 days. Which is Sunday + 6 days (since 27 mod 7 is 6). So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. Which matches. So that's correct. Then why is there a contradiction with the 174 days? Because if July 4 is Sunday, then adding 174 days would be Sunday + 174 days. 174 divided by 7 is 24*7=168, 174-168=6. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. But December 25 is Sunday. Therefore, this suggests that the calculation of the number of days between July 4 and December 25 is wrong. Wait, but earlier calculation said 174 days. Let me check again. July 4 to July 31: 27 days. August has 31 days, September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 25. So from July 4 to December 25 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 25. Wait, that's 27 +"], [99, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Tuesday, February 1 to Wednesday, April 20, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between February 1, 2022 (Tuesday) and April 20, 2022 (Wednesday), inclusive. Weekdays are Monday to Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day. Alternatively, maybe calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can break down the months involved. February 1 to April 20. Let's check each month's days. \n\nFirst, February 2022. Since 2022 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. But the start date is February 1, which is a Tuesday. Then March has 31 days, and April has 30 days, but we need up to April 20. \n\nWait, the end date is April 20. So the total period is from February 1 to April 20. Let me calculate the total days first. \n\nFebruary 1 to February 28: 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days would be 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. Wait, but wait, if I include both start and end dates, then that's correct. Because from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days, then March 1 to March 31 is 31 days, and April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. But wait, maybe I should check if that's accurate. Let me confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using a date calculator. But since I can't do that, I need to calculate manually. Let me check the days. \n\nBut maybe another approach: Let's find the number of weeks and extra days. Since each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekends. So if I can find how many full weeks are in the period, multiply by 5, then add the weekdays in the remaining days. \n\nBut first, I need to know the total number of days. Let me check again. \n\nFrom February 1 to April 20, 2022. Let's break it down:\n\nFebruary: 28 days. So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days: 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. \n\nBut wait, if I start on February 1 (day 1) and end on April 20 (day 79), that's correct. So total days is 79. \n\nNow, how many weeks are in 79 days? 79 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 2 days. Because 11*7=77, so 79-77=2 days. So 11 weeks and 2 days. \n\nIn each week, there are 5 weekdays. So 11 weeks would contribute 11*5=55 weekdays. Then, the remaining 2 days need to be checked. \n\nBut what are those two days? The start date is Tuesday, February 1. Let's check the days of the week for the first and last days. \n\nWait, the start date is Tuesday, February 1. Then the next day is Wednesday, February 2, and so on. The end date is April 20, which is a Wednesday. \n\nSo the total period is 79 days. Let me check the day of the week for the last day. Since the start is Tuesday, adding 79 days. Let's compute 79 days later. \n\nBut since 79 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 2 days. So adding 11 weeks (77 days) brings us to the same day of the week, which is Tuesday. Then adding 2 days would be Wednesday. So the end date is Wednesday, which matches the given information. \n\nSo the first day is Tuesday, the last day is Wednesday. So the remaining two days after 11 weeks are Tuesday and Wednesday. \n\nSo in the remaining two days, both are weekdays. So adding 2 weekdays. \n\nSo total weekdays would be 55 + 2 = 57. \n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the first day is Tuesday (included), and the last day is Wednesday (included). So the two extra days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So those are both weekdays. So 55 + 2 = 57. \n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if the first day is included in the count. Since the start date is included, and the end date is included. So the first day is Tuesday, which is a weekday. The last day is Wednesday, which is also a weekday. So the two extra days are both weekdays. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because the total days is 79. So 11 weeks (77 days) plus 2 days. So the first day is day 1 (Tuesday), day 77 is the same day (Tuesday), then day 78 is Wednesday, day 79 is Thursday? Wait, no. Wait, if day 1 is Tuesday, then day 77 is Tuesday (since 77 is 11*7). Then day 78 is Wednesday, day 79 is Thursday. Wait, but the end date is April 20, which is Wednesday. So that contradicts. \n\nWait, this suggests that my previous calculation is wrong. Because if the start date is Tuesday, then adding 79 days would be 79 days later. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the total days. Let me check again. \n\nFebruary 1 to April 20. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March has 31 days. So adding 31 days. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total is 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. That's correct. \n\nBut if the start date is day 1 (Tuesday), then day 79 is 78 days later. Wait, no. Wait, the first day is day 1. Then day 79 is 78 days after the start date. \n\nWait, the number of days between two dates inclusive is calculated as (end date - start date + 1). So if I have 79 days, that's correct. \n\nBut if the start date is Tuesday, then adding 78 days would bring us to the same day of the week. Because 78 is 11 weeks and 1 day. Wait, 78 divided by 7 is 11*7=77, remainder 1. So 78 days later is 11 weeks and 1 day. So if the start date is Tuesday, then 78 days later is Wednesday. Then day 79 would be Thursday. But the end date is April 20, which is Wednesday. So that's a contradiction. \n\nThis suggests that my initial calculation of the total days is wrong. \n\nWait, so where is the mistake here? \n\nLet me check the dates again. Let me check the actual dates. \n\nFebruary 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me check what day is April 20, 2022. \n\nBut since I can't look it up, I need to calculate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the number of days between February 1 and April 20. \n\nLet me check the days step by step. \n\nFebruary 1 is day 1. \n\nFebruary has 28 days, so February 28 is day 28. \n\nMarch has 31 days, so March 31 is day 28 + 31 = 59. \n\nApril 1 is day 60. \n\nApril 20 is day 60 + 19 = 79. \n\nSo that's correct. So April 20 is day 79. \n\nBut according to the previous calculation, day 79 is 78 days after February 1. \n\nSo if February 1 is Tuesday, then adding 78 days would be 11 weeks (77 days) and 1 day. So 77 days later is Tuesday again, then adding 1 day is Wednesday. So day 78 is Wednesday, day 79 is Thursday. But according to the problem statement, April 20 is Wednesday. So this is a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, there must be an error in my calculation. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the end date is April 20, which is Wednesday. So if day 79 is Wednesday, then that would mean that 78 days after February 1 is Tuesday. \n\nWait, let me check again. \n\nIf day 1 is Tuesday, then day 1 + 7 days is day 8, which is also Tuesday. So day 8 is Tuesday. \n\nSo day 1 + 77 days is day 78, which is Tuesday. Then day 78 is Tuesday. Then day 79 is Wednesday. \n\nSo that would mean that April 20 is Wednesday. So that's correct. \n\nSo my previous mistake was in the calculation of the day of the week. So day 79 is Wednesday. \n\nSo the two extra days after 11 weeks (77 days) are day 78 (Tuesday) and day 79 (Wednesday). So those are both weekdays. \n\nSo the total weekdays would be 11*5 + 2 = 55 + 2 = 57. \n\nBut wait, but the start date is day 1 (Tuesday) and the end date is day 79 (Wednesday). So the two extra days are day 78 (Tuesday) and day 79 (Wednesday). So those are both weekdays. \n\nBut wait, the total days is 79. So the total number of days is 79. \n\nBut if the first day is Tuesday, and the last day is Wednesday, then the total number of weekdays would be 57. \n\nBut maybe I should check another way. Let's count the number of weekends. \n\nTotal days: 79. \n\nNumber of weekends: ?\n\nEach week has 2 weekend days. So 11 weeks have 22 weekend days. Then the remaining 2 days (Tuesday and Wednesday) are weekdays. So weekends are 22. \n\nSo total weekdays would be 79 - 22 = 57. \n\nYes, that's the same as before. \n\nSo the answer should be 57. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another approach. Let's count the number of weeks and the extra days. \n\nAlternatively, let's check the number of days in each month. \n\nFebruary 1 to February 28: 28 days. \n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. So the first week (February 1-7) has 7 days. \n\nBut how many weekdays are in February? \n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. So the first week (February 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday? Wait no. Wait, the first week is Tuesday (day 1) to Monday (day 7). Wait, no. Wait, the days of the week are:\n\nFebruary 1: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 2: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 3: Thursday\n\nFebruary 4: Friday\n\nFebruary 5: Saturday\n\nFebruary 6: Sunday\n\nFebruary 7: Monday\n\nSo in the first week (days 1-7), the weekdays are Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Monday (7). Wait, Saturday and Sunday are weekends. So that's 5 weekdays. \n\nThen February 8 is Tuesday again. So each week has 5 weekdays. \n\nFebruary has 28 days. So 28 days is 4 weeks. So 4*5=20 weekdays in February. \n\nThen March has 31 days. March 1 is Tuesday (since February 28 is Monday, March 1 is Tuesday). Wait, February 28 is Monday (day 7 of February). So March 1 is Tuesday. \n\nSo March 1 is Tuesday. March has 31 days. So 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4*5=20 weekdays, plus 3 days. \n\nThe first three days of March are Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3). All weekdays. So 20 + 3 = 23 weekdays in March. \n\nThen April 1 is Friday (since March 31 is Thursday, so April 1 is Friday). \n\nApril 20 is the end date. April has 30 days. So from April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. \n\nApril 1 is Friday. Let's count the weekdays in April 1-20. \n\nApril 1: Friday (weekday)\n\nApril 2: Saturday (weekend)\n\nApril 3: Sunday (weekend)\n\nApril 4: Monday (weekday)\n\nApril 5: Tuesday (weekday)\n\nApril 6: Wednesday (weekday)\n\nApril 7: Thursday (weekday)\n\nApril 8: Friday (weekday)\n\nApril 9: Saturday (weekend)\n\nApril 10: Sunday (weekend)\n\nApril 11: Monday (weekday)\n\nApril 12: Tuesday (weekday)\n\nApril 13: Wednesday (weekday)\n\nApril 14: Thursday (weekday)\n\nApril 15: Friday (weekday)\n\nApril 16: Saturday (weekend)\n\nApril 17: Sunday (weekend)\n\nApril 18: Monday (weekday)\n\nApril 19: Tuesday (weekday)\n\nApril 20: Wednesday (weekday)\n\nSo from April 1 to April 20, how many weekdays? Let's count:\n\nApril 1 (Fri), 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu), 8 (Fri), 11 (Mon), 12 (Tue), 13 (Wed), 14 (Thu), 15 (Fri), 18 (Mon), 19 (Tue), 20 (Wed). That's 13 weekdays. \n\nWait, let me count again. \n\nFrom April 1 to April 20:\n\nDays 1-3: 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun) \u2192 1 weekday.\n\nDays 4-7: 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu), 8 (Fri) \u2192 5 weekdays (days 4-8, but day 8 is in the next week). Wait, April 1 is day 1, so April 4 is day 4. So days 4-7 are 4 days (Mon to Thu), and day 8 is Friday. So that's 5 weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri). \n\nThen days 9-10: Sat and Sun \u2192 0.\n\nDays 11-13: Mon, Tue, Wed \u2192 3 weekdays.\n\nDays 14-15: Thu, Fri \u2192 2 weekdays.\n\nDays 16-17: Sat, Sun \u2192 0.\n\nDays 18-20: Mon, Tue, Wed \u2192 3 weekdays.\n\nSo total: 1 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 14? Wait, that's 14. But earlier count said 13. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. \n\nWait, let's list all the weekdays in April 1-20:\n\nApril 1: Friday (1)\n\nApril 4: Monday (2)\n\nApril 5: Tuesday (3)\n\nApril 6: Wednesday (4)\n\nApril 7: Thursday (5)\n\nApril 8: Friday (6)\n\nApril 11: Monday (7)\n\nApril 12: Tuesday (8)\n\nApril 13: Wednesday (9)\n\nApril 14: Thursday (10)\n\nApril 15: Friday (11)\n\nApril 18: Monday (12)\n\nApril 19: Tuesday (13)\n\nApril 20: Wednesday (14)\n\nSo that's 14 weekdays. \n\nSo in April, there are 14 weekdays. \n\nSo total weekdays would be February (20) + March (23) + April (14) = 20 + 23 = 43 +14=57. \n\nYes, that matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 57. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 57.\n</think>", "57"], [99, "Name the day of the week for 05/21/2022.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because I remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days, so 2021 started on a Wednesday plus 366 days. Since 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days, so adding two days to Wednesday would make January 1, 2021 a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday plus 1 day, which is Saturday. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a known reference. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think again. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, July 4, 2020 was a Sunday. Then 2020 had 366 days, so July 4, 2021 would be Sunday plus 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday plus two days is Tuesday. So July 4, 2021 was a Tuesday. Then, 2021 had 365 days, so July 4, 2022 would be Tuesday plus 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So Tuesday plus one day is Wednesday. Therefore, July 4, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should check another date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about the days in May. May has 31 days. Let's see, if I can find a known date in May 2022. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, if July 4, 2022 was a Wednesday, then let's count backwards. Let's see, July 4 is Wednesday. Let's go back to May. Let's see, May has 31 days. So May 31 is 31 days before July 4. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can count the days from a known date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is the 131st day of the year (since January has 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, so 31+28+31+30=120, then May 21 is 120+21=141? Wait, no, wait. Wait, January has 31 days, so 31. February 2022 is not a leap year, so 28. March 31, April 30. So up to April 30, that's 31+28+31+30= 120 days. Then May 21 is 120 + 21 = 141st day of the year. Wait, but how does that help me? Well, if I can find the day of the week for a known date in 2022, then I can calculate the day of the week for the 141st day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, earlier I thought that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that again. If 2021 started on a Friday (as I thought earlier), then 2022 would start on a Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, January 1 is Saturday. Then, January 8 is Saturday, and so on. So, let's count the days from January 1 to May 21.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then, January 2 is Sunday, and so on. Let's count the number of days from January 1 to May 21. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 days (2022 is not a leap year)\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 21 days\n\nTotal days from January 1 to May 21 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 21 = let's calculate that. 31+28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 21 is 141. So 141 days. So May 21 is the 141st day of the year. Now, if January 1 is a Saturday, then the day of the week for the 141st day can be calculated by finding 141 mod 7. Because each week has 7 days. So 141 divided by 7 is 20 weeks and 1 day. Because 20*7=140, so 141 is 140 +1. So 141 mod 7 is 1. So if January 1 is Saturday (day 0), then day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, etc. Wait, but if January 1 is Saturday, then day 1 (January 1) is Saturday. Then day 2 is Sunday, day 3 is Monday, and so on. So the 141st day would be 141 - 1 = 140 days after January 1. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the number of days after January 1. So if January 1 is day 1 (Saturday), then day 1 is Saturday, day 2 is Sunday, etc. So the 141st day would be 141 days after January 1. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then day 1 is Saturday. Then day 1 + 7 days is day 8, which is also Saturday. So the day of the week for day N is (N-1) mod 7. Because day 1 is Saturday, which is 0 mod 7. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the calculation. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1 is a Saturday, then:\n\nDay 1: Saturday (0)\nDay 2: Sunday (1)\nDay 3: Monday (2)\n...\nDay 7: Friday (6)\nDay 8: Saturday (0)\nSo the day of the week for day N is (N-1) mod 7. So for day 141, (141-1) = 140. 140 divided by 7 is 20, so 140 mod 7 is 0. So that would be Saturday. Wait, but that would mean that May 21 is a Saturday? But that seems conflicting with my previous thought where I thought July 4 was Wednesday. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, if May 21 is Saturday, then let's check July 4. Let's count the days from May 21 to July 4. May has 31 days, so from May 21 to May 31 is 11 days (since 31-21=10, plus 1 day for the 21st itself? Wait, no. Wait, May 21 is day 141. Then May 22 is 142, ..., May 31 is 141 + 10 = 151. Then June has 30 days, so June 1 is 152, June 30 is 152 + 29 = 181. Then July 1 is 182. July 4 is 182 + 3 = 185. So day 185. Then (185-1) = 184. 184 divided by 7 is 26*7=182, remainder 2. So 184 mod 7 is 2. So that would be day 2, which is Sunday. But earlier I thought July 4 was Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. That means my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is Saturday is wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nSo where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine the initial assumption. I thought that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. But if that's incorrect, then maybe my calculation of January 1, 2021 is wrong. Let me check that again. \n\nI remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 was a leap year, so 366 days. So 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. That seems correct. Then 2021 is 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, that leads to July 4 being Sunday, which conflicts with my previous thought that July 4, 2022 was Wednesday. So there's a problem here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the day of the week for July 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that July 4, 2022 is Wednesday is wrong. Let me try to find another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that May 21, 2022 is the day in question. Let me check another date. For example, I know that May 21, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but I need to confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, but how can I confirm that? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is the same as May 21, 2023, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, but I need to find a way to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's true, then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, and so on. So May 21 would be 20 days after May 1. 20 days later. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. So May 21 would be Saturday. Therefore, that would mean that May 21, 2022 is a Saturday. But then, according to the previous calculation, July 4 would be Sunday. But if that's the case, then maybe my previous calculation was wrong. Let me check again.\n\nIf May 1 is Sunday, then May 1 is day 1. Then May 21 is 20 days later. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. So May 21 is Saturday. Then, May 31 is 30 days after May 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. So May 31 is Tuesday. Then June has 30 days. So June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 30 is 30 days after June 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. So June 30 is Friday. Then July 1 is Saturday. July 4 is 3 days after July 1, which is Tuesday. Wait, that would mean July 4 is Tuesday. But earlier I thought that July 4 was Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that May 1 is Sunday is wrong. Let me check. If May 21 is Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. But how do I know that? Let me think of another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that May 21, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but I need to verify this. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is the same as May 21, 2023. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is a Saturday. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. If that's true, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February 12 is Saturday, February 19 is Saturday, February 26 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday. March 12 is Saturday, March 19 is Saturday, March 26 is Saturday. April 2 is Saturday. April 9 is Saturday, April 16 is Saturday, April 23 is Saturday, April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. So that would mean that May 1 is Sunday. Then May 21 is 20 days later, which is Saturday. So that would make May 21, 2022 a Saturday. Therefore, that seems to be correct. So if that's the case, then July 4 would be Tuesday. But I thought earlier that July 4 was Wednesday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the previous calculation where I thought July 4 was Wednesday. Let me check again. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 31 is Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. June 30 is Friday. July 1 is Saturday. July 4 is Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. So July 4 is Tuesday. But I thought earlier that July 4 was Wednesday. So that must have been a mistake. Therefore, the correct day for May 21 is Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that May 21, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check with another method. For example, using the fact that May 21, 2022 is the same as May 21, 2023. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is the same as May 21, 2021 plus 365 days. 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if May 21, 2021 was a certain day, then May 21, 2022 would be that day plus 1 day. But I don't know what day May 21, 2021 was. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that May 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, if that's true, then May 21, 2021 would be 20 days later. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. Then May 21, 2021 is Friday. Then May 21, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day (since 2021 is not a leap year) = Saturday. That matches the previous calculation.

Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2028 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2028 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2028 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2028 minus 2000 is 28. 28 divided by 4 is 7. So 500 + 7 is 507. That means 2028 divided by 4 is 507 with no remainder. So that's good, it's divisible by 4. \n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 2028 divided by 100 is 20.28, which is not an integer. So it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition (divisible by 400) doesn't apply here. \n\nSince it's divisible by 4 and not a century year, according to the rules, 2028 should be a leap year. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me verify 2028 divided by 4 again. 4 times 500 is 2000, 4 times 507 is 2028. Yes, that's correct. So no error there. \n\nAnother way to think: 2028 is 2000 + 28. 2000 is a leap year, and 28 is divisible by 4. So adding those together, the year 2028 would be a leap year. \n\nI think that's all. The key points are that it's divisible by 4 and not a century year.

Now, the question is asking for the number of Mondays in this range, including both start and end dates.\n\nWait, the start date is Sunday, so that's not a Monday. The end date is Monday, which is included. So between those two dates, how many Mondays are there? Well, the first day is Sunday, so the next day is Monday, which is the end date.

Wait, I think I need to find a reliable way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of the number of days between two dates. For example, if I know that a certain date is a known day, I can calculate the difference. Let's say I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Then July 1 is Friday. Then July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. Then August 5 is Friday, August 12 is Friday, August 19 is Friday, August 26 is Friday. Therefore, August 26 is Friday, so August 27 is Saturday. But if that's the case, then August 27 is Saturday.

Therefore, August 26 is Thursday, so August 27 is Friday. But this contradicts the previous conclusion. So which is correct?\n\nI think I need to find a way to resolve this.

Let me think about the actual calendar. Wait, I think that August 27, 2022 was a Saturday. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that August 27, 2022 is the day of the week. Wait, I think I need to use a different approach.\n\nLet me try using Zeller's Congruence. The formula for Zeller's Congruence is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for the given date August 27, 2022, m is 8, q is 27, year is 2022. So K is 22, J is 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (27 + floor((13*(8 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each part:\n\nFirst, floor((13*(8+1))/5) = floor(13*9/5) = floor(117/5) = floor(23.4) = 23\n\nThen floor(22/4) = 5 (since 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, floor is 5)\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all together:\n\n27 + 23 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 27 + 23 is 50, plus 22 is 72, plus 5 is 77, plus 5 is 82, plus 100 is 182.\n\nNow, 182 mod 7. Since 7*26 is 182, so 182 mod 7 is 0.\n\nBut according to Zeller's Congruence, h=0 corresponds to Saturday. Therefore, August 27, 2022 was a Saturday. So the answer should be Saturday.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought that July 4 was a Monday, I got Friday, but that must have been a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can look up the calendar for July 2022. But since I can't actually look it up right now, I need to rely on my memory or logical calculations. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Let me check with another method. For example, if I know that July 4, 2022, was a Monday, then July 1 would be three days before that. So July 4 is Monday, so July 1 is Monday minus three days, which is Friday. Yes, that matches. So July 1 is Friday. Therefore, the first Tuesday is July 5. So the answer should be 5. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any other possibility. For example, if the first Tuesday is the 5th, then that's correct. But maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for July 1. Let me think again. Let me check another date. For example, July 1, 2022. Let me think of some known events. For example, July 4, 2022, was a Monday. So if July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is three days earlier. So July 1 is Friday. That's correct. So then, the first Tuesday would be July 5. Therefore, the answer is 5. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think of the days of the week for the first week of July. If July 1 is Friday, then the first week would have Friday (1), Saturday (2), Sunday (3), Monday (4), Tuesday (5). So yes, the first Tuesday is the 5th. Therefore, the answer is 5. But wait, the question says \"the first Tuesday of July 2022\". So if July 5 is a Tuesday, then that's the first one. So the answer is 5. But I need to make sure that there isn't a mistake here.

The problem says that January 1st is a Sunday, and I need to find out what day of the week January 21st is. Hmm, right. So first, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 21st. Let me think. Well, January 1st is day 1, so January 21st would be 20 days later, right? Because from the 1st to the 21st is 20 days difference.\n\nWait, but when you count days, if you start on day 1 (Sunday), then adding days would go like: day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, day 3 Tuesday, and so on. So each week has 7 days. So to find out what day of the week it is, I can divide the number of days after January 1st by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the 21st is from Sunday.\n\nSo 20 days later. Let me divide 20 by 7. 7 times 2 is 14, which leaves a remainder of 6. So 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So that means 21st is 6 days after Sunday. Let me count: Sunday (0), Monday (1), Tuesday (2), Wednesday (3), Thursday (4), Friday (5), Saturday (6). So 6 days after Sunday is Saturday. Wait, but wait, if January 1 is Sunday, then adding 7 days would be the next Sunday. So 14 days later is also a Sunday. Then 14 + 6 = 20 days. So 20 days later is 2 weeks and 6 days. So starting from Sunday, adding 6 days would be Saturday. So January 21st is a Saturday?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me count the days step by step. Let's list out the dates:\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Sunday (another 7 days)\n\nJanuary 22: Sunday (another 7 days). Wait, but that would be January 22nd. So January 21st is one day before that. So if January 22 is Sunday, then January 21st is Saturday. Yes, that matches my previous conclusion. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days from January 1 to January 21. Let's see. From 1st to 21st is 20 days. So 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks (14 days) and 6 days. So 2 weeks later is the same day, Sunday. Then 6 days after Sunday is Saturday. Yep, that's the same answer. So I think that's correct.

Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2015 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2015 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2015 minus 2000 is 15. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75. So that's not a whole number. Therefore, 2015 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check again. 4 times 503 is 2012, right? Then 2012 plus 4 is 2016. So 2015 is between those two, so yes, not divisible by 4. So that would mean it's not a leap year. But wait, what about the century years? Well, 2015 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So the only rule that applies here is the first one. Since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2022 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2022 divided by 4. 4 times 505 is 2020, so 2022 minus 2020 is 2. That leaves a remainder of 2, so 2022 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check. Let me add the last two digits, 22, and see if that's divisible by 4. 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, which isn't a whole number. So that confirms it. 2022 isn't divisible by 4.\n\nBut wait, what about century years? The rule is that if a year is divisible by 100, it's not a leap year unless it's also divisible by 400. However, 2022 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So even if it were divisible by 4, which it isn't, the century rule wouldn't apply here. But since it's not divisible by 4 at all, the answer is no. \n\nSo, putting it all together: 2022 isn't divisible by 4, so it's not a leap year.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yes, that seems right. So if that's the case, then each subsequent date can be calculated by adding days.\n\nBut maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use another approach. Let's think about some known dates. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Wait, July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2021 had 365 days, so July 4, 2022 would be 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So July 4, 2022 would be a Monday plus 1 day, which is Tuesday. Wait, but I thought July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different known date. For example, I know that June 26, 2022 is the date in question. Let me think about the days between June 26, 2022 and a known date. Let's take June 26, 2022, and go back to a date I know. For example, if I know that July 4, 2022 is a Monday, then June 26 is 7 days before July 4. Wait, July 4 minus 7 days is June 27. So June 27 would be a Monday. Then June 26 would be a Sunday. Wait, that would mean June 26, 2022 was a Sunday. But I need to confirm if July 4, 2022 is indeed a Monday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. Let's think about June 1, 2022. If I can figure out what day that was, then I can count forward. Let's see. If June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday, then June 26 would be 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So Wednesday plus 4 days is Sunday. But how do I know if June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let's count the days from January 1 to June 26. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Sunday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31, April 30, May 31, and June 26.\n\nSo total days from January 1 to June 26 is:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (including the 1st)\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 26\n\nTotal days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 26 = Let's calculate that step by step.\n\n31 + 28 = 59\n59 + 31 = 90\n90 + 30 = 120\n120 + 31 = 151\n151 + 26 = 177 days.\n\nSo June 26 is 177 days after January 1, 2022. Now, since January 1 is a Sunday, we can calculate 177 days later. Since each week has 7 days, 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 2 days (because 25*7=175, 177-175=2). So 25 weeks later is the same day, Sunday, plus 2 days would be Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean June 26 is a Tuesday? But earlier I thought maybe Sunday. Hmm, there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let me recount the days from January 1 to June 26.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is day 1. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90. April has 30 days, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120. May has 31 days, so up to May 31 is 120 + 31 = 151. Then June 26 is 26 days into June. So total days from January 1 to June 26 is 151 + 26 = 177. That's correct.\n\nSo 177 days after January 1, 2022. Since January 1 is a Sunday, adding 177 days. 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks (175 days) and 2 days. So 25 weeks later is the same day, Sunday, plus 2 days is Tuesday. So June 26 would be a Tuesday? But earlier I thought that July 4 was a Monday, which would make June 27 a Monday, so June 26 would be Sunday. Which is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that July 4, 2022 is a Monday is wrong. Let me check that again. If June 26 is a Tuesday, then June 27 is Wednesday. Then July 4 is 7 days later, which would be Wednesday again. Wait, that can't be. Wait, if June 26 is Tuesday, then June 27 is Wednesday, June 28 is Thursday, June 29 is Friday, June 30 is Saturday, July 1 is Sunday, July 2 is Monday, July 3 is Tuesday, July 4 is Wednesday. So that would mean July 4 is a Wednesday. But I thought earlier that July 4 was a Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my initial assumption that June 26 is Tuesday must be wrong. Where is the mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is incorrect. Let me check that. Let me think about a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year). So 2021 would be 366 days later. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be a Friday. Then 2021 is 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought that it was a Sunday. So maybe I was wrong earlier. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then the calculation for June 26 would be different.\n\nSo let's recalculate. If January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then the total days from January 1 to June 26 is 177 days. 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 2 days. So 25 weeks later is Saturday, plus 2 days is Monday. So June 26 would be a Monday. But then July 4 would be 8 days later (June 26 is Monday, June 27 is Tuesday, June 28 Wednesday, June 29 Thursday, June 30 Friday, July 1 Saturday, July 2 Sunday, July 3 Monday, July 4 Tuesday. Wait, that would make July 4 a Tuesday. But I thought that July 4 was a Monday. So this is conflicting again. So maybe my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check an actual calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to find another way. Let me check another approach. Let's use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, how do I know that? Let me think. If January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then January has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday, January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days later. 28 days is 4 weeks, so February 28 is also a Saturday. Then March 1 is a Sunday. Wait, that would mean March 1 is a Sunday. But that contradicts my previous thought. So if March 1 is Sunday, then March 1 is Sunday. Then March 8 is Sunday, March 15 is Sunday, March 22 is Sunday, March 29 is Sunday. Then April 5 is Sunday. April 12 is Sunday, April 19 is Sunday, April 26 is Sunday. May 3 is Sunday. May 10 is Sunday, May 17 is Sunday, May 24 is Sunday, May 31 is Sunday. Then June 7 is Sunday. June 14 is Sunday, June 21 is Sunday, June 28 is Sunday. So June 26 would be two days before June 28, which is Sunday. So June 26 would be Saturday. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous calculation where if January 1 is Saturday, then June 26 is Monday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is Monday, then June 26 is 8 days earlier. 8 days before July 4 is June 27. So June 27 is Sunday, June 26 is Saturday. So that would mean June 26 is Saturday. But how do I know that July 4 is Monday? Let me think. If I can find another way to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 is the day in question. Let me think about the day of the week for June 26, 2022. Wait, I think I remember that June 26, 2022 was a Sunday. But I need to verify this. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 is the day of the week for a known event. For example, I know that June 26, 2022 was the day when the International Day of the United Nations. But I don't know the day of the week for that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 is 26 days into June. Let me think about the days in June. If I can find the day of the week for June 1, 2022, then I can count forward. Let's say June 1 is a Wednesday. Then June 8 is Wednesday, June 15 is Wednesday, June 22 is Wednesday, June 29 is Wednesday. So June 26 would be 26-22=4 days before June 29, which is Wednesday. So June 26 would be Saturday. But if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 26 is 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So Wednesday plus 4 days is Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting. So if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 26 is Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, June 26 is Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my assumption about June 1 being Wednesday is wrong.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to find a better way. Let me try using Zeller's Congruence. The formula for Zeller's Congruence for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for June 26, 2022, the month is 6, so we don't need to adjust. So for June 26, 2022:\n\nq = 26\nm = 6\nYear is 2022, so K = 22, J = 20\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (26 + floor((13*(6 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each part:\n\nfloor((13*7)/5) = floor(91/5) = floor(18.2) = 18\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all together:\n\n26 + 18 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 26 + 18 is 44, plus 22 is 66, plus 5 is 71, plus 5 is 76, plus 100 is 176.\n\nNow 176 mod 7. Let's divide 176 by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 176-175=1. So h=1.\n\nAccording to Zeller's Congruence, h=1 corresponds to Sunday (since 0 is Saturday, 1 is Sunday).

Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both ends. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. July has 31 days. So July 31 is the first day, which is a Sunday. Then August has 31 days, and September has 30 days. October 2 is the end date. Let me calculate the total days from July 31 to October 2 inclusive.\n\nWait, from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days (since July 31 is day 1, then August 31 is 31 days later). Then September has 30 days, so adding that gives 31 + 30 = 61 days. Then October 1 is day 62, and October 2 is day 63. Wait, but that would be 63 days total? Wait, no. Wait, if July 31 is day 1, then August 31 is 31 days later. So from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September has 30 days, so adding that gives 31 + 30 = 61 days. Then October 1 is day 62, and October 2 is day 63. So total days between July 31 and October 2 inclusive is 63 days? Wait, but if you count from July 31 (day 1) to August 31 (day 31), then September 1 is day 32, and so on. So October 2 would be 31 (July) + 30 (August) + 2 (September?) Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is day 1. Then August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 31 + 1? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between the two dates. Let's use the actual dates. July 31, 2022 is a Sunday. Then August has 31 days. So August 31 is 31 days after July 31. Then September has 30 days, so September 30 is 30 days after August 31. Then October 2 is 2 days after September 30. So total days from July 31 to October 2 inclusive is 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 2 (October) = 63 days. Wait, but that's if you count each month's days. But since July 31 is the start, adding August (31 days) would take us to August 31. Then September has 30 days, so adding that would take us to September 30. Then October 1 is day 31 + 30 + 1 = 62? Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the number of days between July 31 and October 2 inclusive. Let me check with a calendar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July 31 is a Sunday. Let's list the days of the week for each date. Since July 31 is Sunday, then August 1 is Monday. Then August has 31 days. So August 1 is Monday, August 2 is Tuesday, ..., August 7 is Sunday. Then August 8 is Monday again. So each week has 7 days. So August has 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So August has 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. So the first three days of August (August 1-3) are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Then the rest of August would be 28 days (4 weeks). Then September has 30 days. September 1 is a Monday (since August 31 is a Wednesday? Wait, August 31 is the 31st day of August. Let me check: August 1 is Monday, so August 7 is Sunday. Then August 8 is Monday. August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. Then August 30 is Tuesday, August 31 is Wednesday. So September 1 is Thursday. Wait, that's important. So September 1 is a Thursday. Then September has 30 days. So September 1 is Thursday, September 2 is Friday, September 3 is Saturday, September 4 is Sunday, and so on. Then October 1 is a Sunday (since September has 30 days, which is 4 weeks and 2 days. So September 1 is Thursday, September 29 is Thursday (since 28 days is 4 weeks). Then September 30 is Friday. Then October 1 is Saturday? Wait, that can't be. Wait, if September 1 is Thursday, then September 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. Then September 30 is Friday. So October 1 is Saturday. But the problem says that October 2 is a Sunday. So that's correct. So October 1 is Saturday, October 2 is Sunday. So the end date is Sunday.\n\nSo now, the total days from July 31 (Sunday) to October 2 (Sunday) inclusive is 63 days. Let me check that again. July 31 is day 1. August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 31. Then September has 30 days, so September 30 is day 31 + 30 = 61. Then October 1 is day 62 (Saturday), October 2 is day 63 (Sunday). So total 63 days.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of weekdays (Monday-Friday) in these 63 days. Since the start and end dates are both Sundays, maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, since each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekends. So if there are 63 days, that's 9 weeks (63 / 7 = 9). So 9 weeks would have 9 * 5 = 45 weekdays. But wait, since the start and end dates are both Sundays, that would mean that the period is exactly 9 weeks. Wait, 7 days per week, 9 weeks is 63 days. So if the start is Sunday, then the end is also Sunday. So that would mean that the period is exactly 9 weeks. Therefore, the number of weekdays would be 9 * 5 = 45. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, but let's check. Let's take the first week: July 31 (Sunday) to August 6 (Saturday). That's 7 days. Weekdays here are Monday (August 1) to Friday (August 5). So 5 weekdays. Then the next week is August 7 (Sunday) to August 13 (Saturday). Weekdays are Monday (August 7) to Friday (August 11). Wait, but August 7 is a Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought that August 31 is Wednesday. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that August 31 is Wednesday. Let me check again. July 31 is Sunday. August 1 is Monday. Then August 7 is Sunday. August 8 is Monday. August 15 is Sunday. August 22 is Sunday. August 29 is Sunday. Then August 30 is Monday? Wait, no. Wait, August 29 is Sunday. Then August 30 is Monday, August 31 is Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nIf July 31 is Sunday, then August 1 is Monday. Then August 7 is Sunday (since 7 days later). Then August 8 is Monday. Then August 15 is Sunday, August 22 is Sunday, August 29 is Sunday. Then August 30 is Monday, August 31 is Tuesday. So August 31 is Tuesday. Then September 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that's different from what I thought before. So September 1 is Wednesday. Then September 1 is Wednesday. Then September 2 is Thursday, September 3 is Friday, September 4 is Saturday, September 5 is Sunday. Then September 6 is Monday. So September has 30 days. So September 30 is a Monday? Wait, September 1 is Wednesday. Let's count the days. September has 30 days. So 30 days from September 1 (Wednesday). 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, so September 28 is Wednesday. Then September 29 is Thursday, September 30 is Friday. So September 30 is Friday. Then October 1 is Saturday, October 2 is Sunday. So that's correct. So the end date is Sunday, October 2.\n\nSo the total days from July 31 (Sunday) to October 2 (Sunday) is 63 days. Now, since each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekends. If the period is exactly 9 weeks, then 9 * 5 = 45 weekdays. But wait, let's check the first week. July 31 is Sunday. Then the first week (July 31 to August 6) includes 7 days. The weekdays here are Monday (August 1) to Friday (August 5). That's 5 days. Then the next week (August 7 to August 13) is another 7 days. Weekdays are Monday (August 7) to Friday (August 11). So again 5 days. So each week has 5 weekdays. So 9 weeks would be 45 weekdays. But wait, the start date is Sunday, and the end date is Sunday. So the total days are 63, which is 9 weeks. Therefore, the answer is 45?\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if the first day is a Sunday and the last day is a Sunday. So the first week starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday. Then the next week starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday. So in 9 weeks, the total days would be 9*7=63. So the first day is Sunday, the last day is Sunday. So the number of weekdays would be 9*5=45. But wait, let me check with actual dates.\n\nLet me take the first week: July 31 (Sunday) to August 6 (Saturday). Weekdays are Monday (Aug 1) to Friday (Aug 5). That's 5 days. Then the next week is August 7 (Sunday) to August 13 (Saturday). Weekdays are Monday (Aug 7) to Friday (Aug 11). Again 5 days. So each week has 5 weekdays. So 9 weeks would be 45. But wait, the total days are 63. So 63 days. So 63 divided by 7 is 9. So 9 weeks. So 9*5=45 weekdays. Therefore, the answer is 45?\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Because the first day is Sunday, which is a weekend. So in the first week, the first day is Sunday (weekend), and the last day is Saturday (weekend). So the weekdays are the 5 days in between. So that's correct. Then the next week starts on Sunday again. So each week has 5 weekdays. So 9 weeks would be 45. Therefore, the answer is 45.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in the period, then subtract from total days.\n\nTotal days: 63. Number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) is ?\n\nSince the period starts on Sunday and ends on Sunday, and is 9 weeks. Each week has 2 weekend days. So 9*2=18 weekend days. Therefore, the number of weekdays is 63 - 18 = 45. So same answer. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 45.\n</think>", "45"], [99, "How many Tuesdays are there from Saturday, October 29, 2022 to Sunday, October 30, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

So I need to figure out the days of the week for those dates and count how many Tuesdays fall within that range.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week October 29, 2022, was. The user mentioned it's a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think October 29, 2022, was indeed a Saturday. Let me think. If I remember correctly, October 29, 2022, was a Saturday. Then October 30 would be a Sunday. So the period in question is from Saturday the 29th to Sunday the 30th, inclusive. \n\nNow, the question is how many Tuesdays are in that period. Let's list the dates and their corresponding days. \n\nStarting with October 29, 2022: Saturday. Then October 30 is Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. Wait, but the period is inclusive of both dates. So that's two days total. Now, are there any Tuesdays in between? Well, the first day is Saturday, the next day is Sunday. So between those two days, there's no Tuesday. Because the next day after Saturday is Sunday, then Monday, then Tuesday. But the period only includes up to Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, there are zero Tuesdays in that period. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me think again. Let's check the actual days. If October 29 is a Saturday, then October 30 is a Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. So the days in between are only those two. Therefore, there are no Tuesdays. So the answer should be zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's a possibility that the dates could be different. But the user says that the start date is Saturday, October 29, 2022, and the end date is Sunday, October 30, 2022. So that's two days. So the answer is zero Tuesdays. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check the actual calendar for 2022. Let me think. For example, if I look up October 2022, what days were the weeks? Let me try to recall. October 29, 2022, was a Saturday. Then October 30 is Sunday. So the next day, October 31, would be Monday. Then November 1 is Tuesday. So between the 29th and 30th, there's no Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is zero. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be 0.\n</think>", "0"], [99, "Between Saturday, April 9, 2022 and Friday, July 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Friday occur? Reply with the numerical value.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many Fridays there are between April 9, 2022 (Saturday) and July 1, 2022 (Friday), inclusive. Hmm. So first, I should probably find out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many weeks and extra days there are, which would tell me the number of Fridays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates or find the first and last day of the period and then calculate. Let me start by checking the starting date. April 9, 2022 is a Saturday. So the first day of the period is Saturday. The last day is July 1, 2022, which is a Friday. So the period starts on a Saturday and ends on a Friday. That means the total number of days is (July 1 - April 9) + 1. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of days between April 9 and July 1. Let's break it down month by month. April has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 = 21 days. Then May has 31 days, and June has 30 days. Then July 1 is the next day. So total days would be 21 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July 1) = 21 + 31 is 52, plus 30 is 82, plus 1 is 83 days. Wait, but wait, if April 9 is day 1, then April 30 is 22 days later? Wait, no. Wait, if April 9 is the first day, then April 10 is day 2, so April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 = 21 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to check that again. Wait, the total number of days between April 9 and July 1 inclusive is (July 1 - April 9) + 1. Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days by adding the days in each month. Let's see:\n\nFrom April 9 to April 30: 30 - 9 = 21 days. Then May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. So total days would be 21 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 83 days. Wait, but that seems like adding 21 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July 1) = 83. But if April 9 is day 1, then April 30 is day 22 (since 30-9=21 days later, so 21+1=22 days total in April). Then May has 31 days, so May 31 is day 22 + 31 = 53. Then June has 30 days, so June 30 is day 53 + 30 = 83. Then July 1 is day 84. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if April 9 is day 1, then April 10 is day 2, ..., April 30 is day 22 (since 30 - 9 = 21 days after April 9, so 21 + 1 = 22 days total in April). Then May has 31 days, so May 31 is day 22 + 31 = 53. Then June has 30 days, so June 30 is day 53 + 30 = 83. Then July 1 is day 84. But the problem says that the period is from April 9 to July 1 inclusive. So that would be 84 days total. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 83. So which is correct?\n\nWait, the formula for the number of days between two dates inclusive is (end date - start date) + 1. So if April 9 is day 1, then July 1 is (July 1 - April 9) + 1. Let me check the actual number of days between April 9 and July 1. Let's calculate the days step by step.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 21 days (since 30 - 9 = 21). Then May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. So total days would be 21 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 83. But according to the other method, if April 9 is day 1, then July 1 is day 84. So there's a discrepancy here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the first approach. Let me think. If April 9 is day 1, then April 10 is day 2, ..., April 30 is day 22. Then May 1 is day 23. Then May has 31 days, so May 31 is day 23 + 30 = 53? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is day 23, so May 2 is 24, ..., May 31 is 23 + 30 = 53? Wait, no. Wait, May has 31 days. So from May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. So if May 1 is day 23, then May 31 is day 23 + 30 = 53? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is day 23. Then May 2 is day 24, ..., May 31 is day 23 + 30 = 53?

But the question says from Monday, October 24, 2022, to Monday, January 16, 2022. That would be going backward in time. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)\". But October 24 is in 2022, and January 16 is also in 2022. But October is after January in the year. So October 24 is later than January 16. So that would mean the period is from a later date to an earlier date. Which would be a negative number of days. But that's impossible. Therefore, I think there's a mistake here. Maybe the end date is supposed to be January 16, 2023? Because that would make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the dates to be in reverse. But the question is as stated. Wait, maybe the user made a typo and the end date is actually January 16, 2023. But I need to check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?\"\n\nWait, that's definitely from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022. But that's going backward. So maybe the user intended the dates to be in the next year? Because otherwise, the answer would be zero or negative. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check the actual dates. October 24, 2022 is a Monday. January 16, 2022 is a Monday. Wait, but January 16, 2022 is earlier than October 24, 2022. So the period is from a later date to an earlier date. Therefore, the correct way is to reverse the dates. So maybe the user intended to ask from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. But that's not what's written. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the year. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check the actual day of the week for those dates. Wait, October 24, 2022 is a Monday. Let me check January 16, 2022. Let me check that. January 16, 2022: Let me think. January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So January 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday. So January 3 is Monday. Then January 16 is 13 days later. 13 days after January 3 is January 16. 13 divided by 7 is 1 week and 6 days. So January 3 + 6 days is January 9, then 16. So January 16 is a Monday? Wait, January 3 is Monday. Then adding 13 days: 13 days is 1 week (7 days) plus 6 days. So January 3 + 7 days is January 10 (Monday), then adding 6 days: January 10 + 6 days is January 16. So yes, January 16, 2022 is a Monday. So both dates are Mondays. But the start date is October 24, 2022, which is later in the year than January 16, 2022. Therefore, the period from October 24 to January 16 is going backward. Therefore, the correct way is to reverse the dates. So the user probably made a mistake in the dates. But since the question is as written, maybe I need to proceed with that. But that would result in a negative number of days. But since the question says \"inclusive of both dates\", maybe the answer is zero? But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the dates to be in the next year. Let me check. If the end date is January 16, 2023, then that would make sense. But the user wrote 2022. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the order of the dates. Let me check the original question again. The user wrote: \"from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)\". So the start date is October 24, 2022, and the end date is January 16, 2022. But that's impossible. Therefore, I think there's a mistake here. However, since the user is asking the question, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the dates are correct, but perhaps the user intended the end date to be later. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days between those two dates, but in reverse. But that would be a negative number. However, since the question is from the user, maybe I should proceed with the dates as given, but that would be impossible. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the dates. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the answer would be the number of business days between those two dates. But the user wrote the dates in reverse. So maybe that's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. But that's not what's written. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, but that's going backward. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to assume that the user made a mistake in the dates and that the end date is January 16, 2023. But since the user wrote 2022, I need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days between those two dates, but in reverse. But that would be zero. However, that's not possible. Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the user made a mistake in the dates. But since I have to answer based on the given dates, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the dates are correct and that the period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, which is going backward. Therefore, the number of business days would be zero, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the dates to be in the next year. Let me check the actual dates again. Wait, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. Let me check that. Let me calculate that. But the user wrote 2022 for both dates. So I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. Let me proceed with that assumption, because otherwise, the question is impossible. So I'll proceed with that. So the correct dates are from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. Let me check that. So January 16 is a Monday, and October 24 is a Monday. So the period is from January 16 to October 24, 2022. Now, I need to calculate the number of business days between those two dates, inclusive. So first, I need to find the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, calculate the number of weeks and days. Let me start by calculating the total number of days between January 16, 2022, and October 24, 2022. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days. So from January 16 to January 31: 31 - 16 = 15 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and October 24. So let's add them up. January: 15 days (from 16 to 31). February: 28. March: 31. April: 30. May: 31. June: 30. July: 31. August: 31. September: 30. October: 24. Now, adding these up. Let's do step by step. January: 15. February: 15 + 28 = 43. March: 43 + 31 = 74. April: 74 + 30 = 104. May: 104 + 31 = 135. June: 135 + 30 = 165. July: 165 + 31 = 196. August: 196 + 31 = 227. September: 227 + 30 = 257. October: 257 + 24 = 281. So total days from January 16 to October 24 is 281 days. But wait, that's the total number of days between January 16 and October 24 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, when you calculate from January 16 to January 31, that's 15 days (since 31-16=15, but including both dates? Wait, no. Wait, if you have January 16 to January 17, that's 2 days. So the formula is (end date - start date + 1). But when I calculated the days between January 16 and January 31, I said 15 days. But that's actually 16 days (including both). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Let's take January 16 to January 17: that's two days. So the number of days between January 16 and January 17 inclusive is 2. So the formula is (end date - start date + 1). So if I have January 16 to January 31, that's 31 - 16 + 1 = 16 days. But earlier, I calculated 15 days. So that's a mistake. Therefore, my previous calculation is wrong. So I need to recalculate. Let me start over. The total number of days from January 16 to October 24 inclusive. Let's break it down. January: from January 16 to January 31. That's 31 - 16 + 1 = 16 days. February: 28 days. March: 31. April: 30. May: 31. June: 30. July: 31. August: 31. September: 30. October: 24 days. Now, adding them up. January: 16. February: 16 + 28 = 44. March: 44 + 31 = 75. April: 75 + 30 = 105. May: 105 + 31 = 136. June: 136 + 30 = 166. July: 166 + 31 = 197. August: 197 + 31 = 228. September: 228 + 30 = 258. October: 258 + 24 = 282. So total days is 282. So that's the total number of days from January 16 to October 24 inclusive. Now, the next step is to subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period. But how to calculate that? Well, since the start date is a Monday (January 16, 2022), and the end date is also a Monday (October 24, 2022). So the period starts and ends on a Monday. So the total number of weeks in this period is (total days - 1) / 7, but maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and days. Let me think. Since the start and end dates are both Mondays, the total number of days is 282. Let me check if 282 is correct. Let me check with another method. Let's check the number of days between January 16, 2022, and October 24, 2022. Let me use an online calculator or a date difference tool. But since I can't do that, I need to calculate manually. Alternatively, I can check the number of days in each month. January has 31 days. So from January 16 to January 31 is 16 days. February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and October 24. So adding those up: 16 + 28 = 44, +31=75, +30=105, +31=136, +30=166, +31=197, +31=228, +30=258, +24=282. Yes, that's correct. So 282 days total. Now, since the start and end dates are both Mondays, the number of weekends can be calculated as follows. Each week has 5 business days and 2 weekends. So the total number of weeks is 282 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 282 divided by 7 is 40 weeks and 2 days. Because 40*7=280, so 282-280=2 days. So there are 40 full weeks and 2 days. Since the start date is a Monday, the first day is Monday, and the last day is also Monday. So the two extra days are Monday and Tuesday. Wait, because 40 weeks is 280 days, and then two days. So the 281st day is Monday (start day + 280 days is the same as the start day, since 280 is 40 weeks). Then the 282nd day is Tuesday. So the two extra days are Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, the number of weekends is 40 weeks * 2 days = 80 weekend days. Then, the two extra days are Monday and Tuesday, which are business days. So total weekends are 80. Therefore, the number of business days is total days (282) minus weekends (80) = 202 business days. Wait, but wait. Wait, the total days is 282. If there are 40 weeks (280 days) and 2 days. So in the 40 weeks, there are 40*2=80 weekend days. Then the two extra days are Monday and Tuesday, which are business days. So total business days would be 282 - 80 = 202. So the answer would be 202. But wait, the original question was from October 24 to January 16, but I assumed the dates were reversed. So if the user intended the dates to be from January 16 to October 24, then the answer is 202. But the user's question was from October 24 to January 16. So if that's the case, then the answer would be negative, but since the user is asking for the number of business days, maybe the correct answer is 202. But I need to check if the user made a mistake in the dates. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the dates to be from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the total days would be from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. Let me calculate that. October has 31 days. So from October 24 to October 31 is 8 days (including both dates). November has 30, December 31"], [99, "On which weekday did October 1, 2022 fall? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022 fell on. Let me think. I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but maybe I should verify that. Let me try to recall some key dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think about 2022. Maybe I can use some known dates. For instance, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. July 4, 2022: if I count the days from there. Let's see, July has 31 days. So July 4 is Monday. Then July 11 is Monday, July 18, July 25, August 1 is Monday. Wait, August 1, 2022 was a Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. Then August 8 is Monday, August 15, 20, 22, 29. Wait, August 22 is a Monday. Then September 1 is a Wednesday? Wait, August has 31 days. So August 1 is Monday, August 2 is Tuesday, etc. So August 31 is a Wednesday. Then September 1 is Thursday? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try again. If August 1 is a Monday, then August 7 is Sunday, August 8 is Monday. So August 8 is Monday. Then August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. Then September 5 is Monday. So September 5 is Monday. Then September 12 is Monday, September 19, September 26. Then October 3 is Monday. So October 3 is Monday. Therefore, October 1 would be Saturday. Because October 3 is Monday, so October 2 is Sunday, October 1 is Saturday. So that would mean October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But wait, I should check if my assumption that August 1 is a Monday is correct. Let me think. July 4, 2022 was a Monday. July has 31 days. So July 4 is Monday. Then July 11 is Monday, July 18, July 25. Then August 1 is the next Monday. So that's correct. So August 1 is Monday. Then the rest of the calculation follows. Therefore, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. For example, I know that October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2021: October 1, 2021 was a Friday. Wait, maybe I should check that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year. So 2022 has 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if October 1, 2021 was a Friday, then October 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Because 365 days later is 52 weeks and one day. So that would mean October 1, 2022 is a Saturday. So that confirms it. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n</think>", "Saturday"], [99, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Wednesday, September 21 to Wednesday, November 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

First, I should figure out the dates and then check each Saturday in that range.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all the dates. Let me think. The total number of days between the two dates, then divide by 7 and adjust for the start and end days. But I need to make sure that the start and end dates are included. Let me check the dates first.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the start and end dates. The start is Wednesday, September 21, 2022. The end is Wednesday, November 30, 2022. So I need to count all Saturdays from September 21 to November 30, inclusive.\n\nLet me check what day of the week each of these dates is. Wait, the start date is a Wednesday. So September 21 is a Wednesday. Then, the next Saturday would be September 24, 2022. Then every 7 days after that. Let me check the dates step by step.\n\nBut maybe I should calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then see how many weeks there are, plus any extra days. But since the start and end are both Wednesdays, maybe the total days are a multiple of 7? Let me check.\n\nWait, September 21 to November 30. Let's calculate the number of days between those dates. Let's break it down:\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (since 30 - 21 = 9, plus 1 day for inclusive). Then October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. But the end date is November 30, so adding those up:\n\nSeptember: 30 - 21 + 1 = 10 days (from 21 to 30 inclusive)\nOctober: 31 days\nNovember: 30 days\nTotal days = 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. Wait, but wait, if the start is September 21 and end is November 30, then the total days between them inclusive is 71 days. Let me check that again.

So if I can find the number of days between September 21 and November 30, inclusive.\n\nBut maybe I should check the actual dates. Let me think. September 21 is day 1. Then September 28 is 7 days later, which is also a Wednesday. Then October 5, 12, 19, 26. Then November 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Wait, but November 30 is the end date. So let's list all the Saturdays in that period.\n\nStarting from September 21 (Wednesday), the next Saturday is September 24. Then each week after that. Let's list them:\n\nSeptember 24 (Sat)\nSeptember 31? Wait, September has 30 days. So September 24 is Saturday. Then September 31 is not a valid date. So next Saturday would be October 1 (since October 1 is a Saturday? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, September 24 is a Saturday. Then September 24 + 7 days is October 1. Let me check what day October 1, 2022 is. Wait, I need to confirm that. But maybe I can check the actual days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that September 21 is a Wednesday. So September 21 is Wednesday. Then September 22 is Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday. So that's correct. Then October 1 is 24 + 7 = 31 days? Wait, September 24 is the 24th. Adding 7 days would be October 1. So October 1 is a Saturday. Then October 8, 15, 22, 29. Then November 5, 12, 19, 26. Then December 3, but the end date is November 30. So November 26 is a Saturday. Then November 26 + 7 is December 3, which is beyond the end date. So the last Saturday in the period is November 26. Wait, but November 30 is the end date. Wait, November 26 is a Saturday. Then November 26 + 7 is December 3. So November 30 is a Wednesday. So the last Saturday is November 26.

Let me check the actual days. For example, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, I can check online, but since I can't, I need to rely on my knowledge. Wait, I remember that in 2022, October 1 was a Saturday. So that's correct. Then October 8, 15, 22, 29. Then November 5, 12, 19, 26. So that's 10 Saturdays. So the answer is 10?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total days between the two dates and then divide by 7. The total days between September 21 and November 30 inclusive is 71 days. So 71 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 1 day. So that would mean 10 Saturdays. Because if the start date is a Wednesday, then the first Saturday is the 3rd day (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). So in 71 days, there are 10 weeks (70 days) and 1 day. So the number of Saturdays would be 10. Because the first Saturday is day 3 (if the start is day 1). Then each week adds one. So 70 days would have 10 Saturdays. Then the 71st day is a Wednesday (since 70 days later is the same day of the week as the start date, which is Wednesday). So the 71st day is Wednesday, which is the end date. So that would mean that there are 10 Saturdays in total. So that matches the previous count. Therefore, the answer is 10.\n</think>", "10"], [99, "In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. I need to figure out what day of the week April 3rd falls on. Alright, let's start by breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I know that January has 31 days. So, if January 1st is a Tuesday, then I can calculate the day of the week for each subsequent date in January. Then, I can move on to February, March, and finally April. But wait, I need to consider whether it's a leap year or not. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. But since the question is about a specific year where January 1st is a Tuesday, maybe I need to assume it's a common year unless told otherwise. Wait, but actually, the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years, so maybe I should just proceed with the standard 365-day year. Wait, but actually, the problem might not require knowing if it's a leap year because the dates in question are in April, which is before February 29th. Wait, no, if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check if the year is a leap year. Wait, but how can I know? The problem says \"a year where Tuesday is January 1st\"\u2014so maybe the year is not a leap year? Or maybe it's possible that it's a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't give any other information. Hmm. Maybe I need to assume that it's a common year. But maybe I should check both possibilities? Wait, but maybe the answer is the same regardless. Let me think. Let's proceed with the assumption that it's a common year, which has 365 days. Because if it's a leap year, the calculation would be different for February. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is based on a common year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. Wait, but April 3rd is after February, so if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. Let me check. Let's first calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's do that step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So, January 1st is Tuesday. Then, January 2nd is Wednesday, and so on. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 or 29 days (depending on leap year)\nMarch: 31 days\nApril 3rd: 3 days into April.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93 days. Wait, but if it's a leap year, February would be 29 days, so 31 + 29 + 31 + 3 = 94 days. So the total days between January 1st and April 3rd is either 93 or 94 days, depending on leap year. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check if the year is a leap year. Wait, but how? Because the problem says that January 1st is a Tuesday. So maybe the year is not a leap year? Wait, but how can I know? Wait, maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. Wait, but that's not possible. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then the day of the week would shift by one more day. Wait, but how can I know? Maybe the problem is intended to be solved without considering leap years. Let me check the problem again. The problem says \"In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3.\" So the problem is in a specific year where January 1st is Tuesday. But the problem doesn't mention whether it's a leap year. Therefore, perhaps the answer is the same regardless of leap year? Wait, but that's not possible. Let me check. Let's suppose that the year is a common year. Then, the total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 93 days. Then, since January 1st is Tuesday, adding 93 days. Let's compute 93 divided by 7. Because there are 7 days in a week. 93 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 2 days. So 13 weeks is exactly 91 days, so 93 days is 13 weeks and 2 days. Therefore, adding 2 days to Tuesday would be Thursday. So April 3rd would be Thursday. But if it's a leap year, then the total days would be 94 days. 94 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Tuesday would be Friday. Therefore, the answer depends on whether it's a leap year. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. So this is a problem. How can I know if the year is a leap year? Wait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if the year is a leap year, then February 29th would be in that year. But since the problem is about April 3rd, which is after February, but the problem doesn't mention anything about February 29th. Wait, but maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check. Let me think about the actual calendar. For example, if January 1st is a Tuesday, then in a non-leap year, the next year's January 1st would be a Tuesday plus 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So the next year's January 1st would be a Wednesday. But if it's a leap year, then 366 days is 52 weeks and 2 days, so the next year's January 1st would be a Thursday. But the problem doesn't mention anything about the next year. So how can I know if the current year is a leap year? Wait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if the problem is in a leap year, then the answer would be different. But since the problem is given without any other information, maybe the answer is intended to be Thursday. But I need to check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let me calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's do it step by step. January has 31 days. So January 1st is day 0 (Tuesday). Then, January 2nd is day 1 (Wednesday), and so on. So, the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 93 days. Wait, but if it's a leap year, then February is 29 days, so 31 + 29 + 31 + 3 = 94 days. So the total days between January 1st and April 3rd is 93 or 94. Therefore, the day of the week would be 93 mod 7 or 94 mod 7. Let's compute 93 divided by 7. 7*13=91, 93-91=2. So 93 mod 7 is 2. So adding 2 days to Tuesday. Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday, +2 is Thursday. So April 3rd would be Thursday. If it's a leap year, 94 mod 7 is 3. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. But the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Therefore, how can I answer this? Wait, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if the problem is in a leap year, then the answer would be Friday. But since the problem is given without any other information, maybe the answer is Thursday. But I need to check if there's a way to determine if the year is a leap year. Wait, but how? The problem says that January 1st is a Tuesday. So maybe the year is a leap year if the next year's January 1st is a Thursday. But since the problem doesn't mention anything about the next year, maybe the answer is intended to be Thursday. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let me think of another approach. Let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Tuesday. Let's count the days for each month. January has 31 days. So January 1st is Tuesday. Then, January 8th is also Tuesday, and so on. Let's find out what day of the week is February 1st. Since January has 31 days, which is 31 mod 7. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 31 days later is 3 days after Tuesday. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. Therefore, February 1st is a Friday. Now, if it's a common year, February has 28 days. So February 28th is 28 days after February 1st. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28th is also a Friday. Then March 1st is the next day, which is Saturday. March has 31 days. So March 1st is Saturday. Then, March 8th is Saturday, March 15th is Saturday, March 22nd is Saturday, March 29th is Saturday. Then April 5th is Saturday. Therefore, April 3rd is two days before April 5th, which would be Thursday. So that's Thursday. But if it's a leap year, then February has 29 days. So February 1st is Friday. Then, February 29th is 28 days after February 1st (which is 4 weeks) plus 1 day. So February 29th is Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Then March 1st is Sunday. Then March has 31 days. March 1st is Sunday. Then March 8th is Sunday, March 15th is Sunday, March 22nd is Sunday, March 29th is Sunday. Then April 5th is Sunday. Therefore, April 3rd is two days before April 5th, which is Friday. So in that case, the answer would be Friday. But the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. So how can I know? Wait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if the problem is in a leap year, then the answer would be Friday. But since the problem is given without any other information, maybe the answer is Thursday. But how can I be sure? Wait, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the answer is Thursday. Because the problem says \"a year where Tuesday is January 1st\"\u2014so maybe the year is not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, then the next year's January 1st would be a Thursday. But the problem doesn't mention anything about that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Therefore, the answer is Thursday. But I need to check again. Let me think. Let's take an example. Suppose that January 1st is a Tuesday in a non-leap year. Then, as I calculated, February 1st is Friday. Then March 1st is Saturday. Then April 1st is Saturday + 31 days. Wait, March has 31 days. So March 1st is Saturday. Then March 1st + 31 days is April 1st. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1st is Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. Then April 1st is Tuesday. Therefore, April 3rd is Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday. So that's correct. So in a non-leap year, April 3rd is Thursday. If it's a leap year, then February has 29 days. So February 1st is Friday. Then March 1st is Sunday. Then March has 31 days. So March 1st is Sunday. Then April 1st is Sunday + 31 days. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1st is Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday. Then April 3rd is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. So in that case, it's Friday. But the problem doesn't specify. Therefore, the answer depends on whether it's a leap year. But the problem says \"a year where Tuesday is January 1st\"\u2014so maybe the year is not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, then the next year's January 1st would be a Thursday. But the problem doesn't mention that. Therefore, maybe the answer is Thursday. But how can I be sure? Wait, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the answer is Thursday. Because the problem is likely intended for a non-leap year. Therefore, the answer is Thursday. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a leap year. But without more information, I can't know. However, since the problem is presented in a way that expects a single answer, I think the intended answer is Thursday. Therefore, the answer is Thursday.\n</think>", "Thursday"], [99, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Thursday, June 30 to Tuesday, September 6, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Give the count numerically.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Saturdays fall between June 30, 2022 (Thursday) and September 6, 2022 (Tuesday), inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out the dates of each Saturday in that range.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way than listing all the dates. Let me think. The start date is June 30, 2022, which is a Thursday. So the next day, July 1st is Friday. Then July 2nd is Saturday. So the first Saturday in the range is July 2nd. Then every 7 days after that. Let me check the end date. September 6th is a Tuesday. So the last Saturday would be... Let's see. Let me figure out the days of the week for each month.\n\nFirst, June 30 is Thursday. July has 31 days. So July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday. Then July 9, 16, 23, 30 are Saturdays. Then August has 31 days. August 6 is a Saturday? Wait, let me check. Wait, July has 31 days. So July 31 is a Monday. Then August 1 is Tuesday. August 6 is a Sunday? Wait, maybe I need to calculate the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the start and end dates, then divide by 7 and adjust for the starting day. But since the start date is Thursday, and the end date is Tuesday, maybe I need to find how many weeks are in that period and then check if there are extra days that include a Saturday.\n\nWait, let's first find the total number of days between June 30 and September 6, inclusive. Let me calculate that. June 30 is the first day. Then July has 31 days, so from June 30 to July 31 is 31 days. Then August has 31 days, so adding that. Then September 1 to September 6 is 6 days. Wait, but the end date is September 6. So total days from June 30 to September 6 inclusive is (31 days in July) + (31 days in August) + 6 days in September? Wait, no. Wait, June 30 is day 1. Then July has 31 days, so July 31 is day 31 + 1 (since June 30 is day 1). Wait, maybe I should calculate the total days between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula: (end date - start date + 1) days. But I need to know the exact number of days between June 30 and September 6. Let me break it down:\n\nJune 30 to July 31: 31 days (since June has 30 days, so from June 30 to July 30 is 30 days, plus 1 day for July 31? Wait, no. Wait, June 30 is day 1. Then July 1 is day 2, July 2 is day 3, etc. So from June 30 to July 31 is 31 days (since July has 31 days). Then August has 31 days, so from August 1 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September 1 to September 6 is 6 days. So total days from June 30 to September 6 inclusive is 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 6 (September) = 68 days? Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, June 30 is day 1. Then July has 31 days, so July 31 is day 31 + 1? Wait, no. Wait, if June 30 is day 1, then July 1 is day 2, July 2 is day 3, ..., July 31 is day 31 + 1 = day 32? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days between June 30 and July 31 inclusive is 31 (July) + 1 (June 30) = 32 days? Wait, that's not correct. Wait, if you have two dates, the number of days between them inclusive is (end date - start date + 1). So June 30 to July 31 is (July 31 - June 30) + 1. Let me calculate the difference in days. June has 30 days, so July 31 is 31 days after June 30. So the total days from June 30 to July 31 inclusive is 31 + 1 = 32 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have two dates, the number of days between them inclusive is (end date - start date) + 1. So if June 30 is day 0, then July 31 is 31 days later. So the total days would be 31 + 1 = 32. But that's if you count both start and end. So from June 30 to July 31 is 32 days. Then adding August 31 days (from August 1 to August 31 is 31 days), so from June 30 to August 31 is 32 + 31 = 63 days. Then September 6 is 6 days after August 31. So total days from June 30 to September 6 inclusive is 63 + 6 = 69 days. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check with another approach. Let me check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to calculate manually. Let me check the days step by step.\n\nJune 30 is Thursday. July 1 is Friday. July 2 is Saturday. July 3 is Sunday. July 4 is Monday. July 5 is Tuesday. July 6 is Wednesday. July 7 is Thursday. July 8 is Friday. July 9 is Saturday. So every 7 days after July 2 is a Saturday. So July 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5 Saturdays in July. Then August 6 is a Saturday? Let's see. July 30 is a Saturday. Then July 31 is Sunday. August 1 is Monday. August 2 is Tuesday. August 3 is Wednesday. August 4 is Thursday. August 5 is Friday. August 6 is Saturday. So August 6 is Saturday. Then August 13, 20, 27. Then September 3 is Saturday. September 6 is Tuesday. So the Saturdays in August are 6, 13, 20, 27. That's 4 Saturdays. Then in September, the first Saturday is September 3. Then September 10, 17, 24. But September 6 is the end date, so September 3 is the last Saturday before September 6. So that's 3 Saturdays in September. Wait, but September 3 is a Saturday. Then September 10 is after September 6, so not included. So total Saturdays would be 5 (July) + 4 (August) + 1 (September 3) = 10? Wait, but wait, September 3 is within the range. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the end date is September 6. So September 3 is included. So that's one Saturday. So total is 5 + 4 + 1 = 10? But wait, let me check again. Let me list all the Saturdays between June 30 and September 6 inclusive.\n\nFirst, June 30 is Thursday. So the first Saturday is July 2. Then July 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5 Saturdays in July. Then August 6, 13, 20, 27. That's 4 in August. Then September 3 is the next Saturday. September 3 is within the range (since the end is September 6). So that's 1. So total is 5 + 4 + 1 = 10. But wait, is September 3 included? Yes, because the end date is September 6. So that's correct. So the answer is 10?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count each Saturday step by step.\n\nJuly 2 (Sat), 9, 16, 23, 30: 5.\n\nAugust 6, 13, 20, 27: 4.\n\nSeptember 3: 1.\n\nTotal 5+4+1=10. So the answer is 10?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the days. Let me check the days of the week for each date.\n\nJune 30, 2022 is a Thursday. So July 1 is Friday. July 2 is Saturday. Then July 3 is Sunday. July 4 is Monday. July 5 is Tuesday. July 6 is Wednesday. July 7 is Thursday. July 8 is Friday. July 9 is Saturday. So that's correct. Then July 16 is Saturday (7 days after 9th). July 23, 30. Then August 6 is Saturday. Then August 13, 20, 27. Then September 3 is Saturday. September 10 is next, but that's after September 6. So yes, that's 10 Saturdays. So the answer should be 10. But wait, wait. Wait, the start date is June 30, which is Thursday. So the first Saturday is July 2. But what about the end date, September 6 is Tuesday. So the last Saturday is September 3. So that's correct. So 10 Saturdays in total. Therefore, the answer is 10.\n</think>", "10"], [99, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, July 17, 2022 to Tuesday, August 23, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Provide the count as a number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many business days there are from Sunday, July 17, 2022, to Tuesday, August 23, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates involved. The start date is July 17, 2022, which is a Sunday. The end date is August 23, 2022, which is a Tuesday. The question says inclusive of both dates, so both days are counted.\n\nLet me break this down into two parts: the period from July 17 to July 31, and then from August 1 to August 23. But maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, I can count the business days directly by checking each week.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the days of the week for the dates. July 17 is a Sunday. Then July 18 is Monday, 19 Tuesday, 20 Wednesday, 21 Thursday, 22 Friday, 23 Saturday, 24 Sunday, and so on. So the first week (July 17-23) includes Sunday (17), Monday (18), Tuesday (19), Wednesday (20), Thursday (21), Friday (22), Saturday (23). Then July 24 is Sunday again.\n\nNow, the end date is August 23, which is a Tuesday. Let me check what day August 23 is. Wait, maybe I should check the actual calendar for 2022. But since I can't look it up, I need to calculate based on the given information. Wait, the user said that August 23 is a Tuesday. So that's given. So the start date is Sunday, July 17, and the end date is Tuesday, August 23.\n\nSo the total period is from July 17 (Sunday) to August 23 (Tuesday). Let me calculate the total number of days between these two dates, inclusive. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the business days directly. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many weeks and extra days there are between July 17 and August 23.\n\nJuly has 31 days. July 17 is the start. So from July 17 to July 31 is 15 days (including both ends). Wait, July 17 to July 18 is 2 days, so July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total days from July 17 to August 23 inclusive is 15 + 23 = 38 days. Wait, but that's if there's no overlap. Wait, July 17 to July 31 is 15 days, then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total is 15 + 23 = 38 days. But let me check that again. July 17 to July 31: 31 - 17 = 14 days, plus 1 (for inclusive) is 15 days. Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total 15 + 23 = 38 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 38 days.\n\nNow, out of these 38 days, how many are weekends? Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nStarting from July 17 (Sunday). Let's list the days:\n\nJuly 17: Sunday (included)\nJuly 18: Monday\nJuly 19: Tuesday\nJuly 20: Wednesday\nJuly 21: Thursday\nJuly 22: Friday\nJuly 23: Saturday\nJuly 24: Sunday\nJuly 25: Monday\nJuly 26: Tuesday\nJuly 27: Wednesday\nJuly 28: Thursday\nJuly 29: Friday\nJuly 30: Saturday\nJuly 31: Sunday\n\nSo in July, from July 17 to July 31, there are 15 days. The weekends here are July 17 (Sunday), July 23 (Saturday), July 24 (Sunday), July 30 (Saturday), and July 31 (Sunday). Wait, wait. Wait, July 17 is Sunday. Then the next Saturday is July 23. Then Sunday July 24, then Saturday July 30, then Sunday July 31. So that's 5 weekends in July? Wait, but July 17 is Sunday, so that's one weekend day. Then July 23 is Saturday, July 24 is Sunday. Then July 30 is Saturday, July 31 is Sunday. So that's 5 weekend days in July? Wait, but July 17 is included. So in July, from July 17 to July 31, how many Sundays and Saturdays?\n\nSundays: July 17, 24, 31. That's three Sundays. Saturdays: July 23 and 30. That's two Saturdays. So total of 5 weekend days in July. So in July, 5 weekend days.\n\nThen in August, from August 1 to August 23. Let's check the days. August 1 is a Monday (since July 31 is Sunday, so August 1 is Monday). Then August 2 is Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 4 Thursday, 5 Friday, 6 Saturday, 7 Sunday, 8 Monday, etc. So the weekends in August would be August 6 (Saturday), 7 (Sunday), 13 (Saturday), 14 (Sunday), 20 (Saturday), 21 (Sunday), 27 (Saturday). But since we're only going up to August 23, the weekends in August would be August 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21. So that's 6 weekend days in August.\n\nWait, let me check again. August 1 is Monday. So August 6 is Saturday (1+5 days). Then August 7 is Sunday. Then August 13 is Saturday (1+12 days?), wait, August 1 is Monday. So August 6 is Saturday (6 days later). Then August 7 is Sunday. Then August 13 is Saturday (13-1=12 days later, which is 12 days after Monday. 12 divided by 7 is 1 week and 5 days. So 1 week (7 days) later is August 8 (Monday), then 5 days later is August 13 (Saturday). So yes, August 13 is Saturday. Then August 14 is Sunday. Then August 20 is Saturday (13 + 7 days), and August 21 is Sunday. Then August 27 is Saturday, but that's beyond August 23. So in August, from August 1 to August 23, the weekends are August 6,7,13,14,20,21. That's 6 days. So total weekend days in August are 6.\n\nSo total weekend days in the entire period (July 17 to August 23) are 5 (July) + 6 (August) = 11 days.\n\nSo total days is 38. Subtract 11 weekend days, so 38 - 11 = 27 business days. Wait, but let me check again. Wait, the total days is 38. If there are 11 weekend days, then business days would be 38 - 11 = 27. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the total days. Let me check again. July 17 to July 31 is 15 days. August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. 15 + 23 = 38. That's correct. Then the weekends in July are 5 days, August 6 days. Total 11. So 38 - 11 = 27. But let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the business days directly. Starting from July 17 (Sunday) which is not a business day. So the first business day is July 18 (Monday). Then July 18 to July 22 (Friday) is 5 days. Then July 23 is Saturday (non-business), July 24 is Sunday (non-business), July 25 is Monday. So from July 25 to July 31, that's 7 days. Let's count the business days in July.\n\nJuly 18 (Mon), 19 (Tue), 20 (Wed), 21 (Thu), 22 (Fri) \u2192 5 days.\n\nThen July 25 (Mon), 26 (Tue), 27 (Wed), 28 (Thu), 29 (Fri) \u2192 5 days.\n\nJuly 30 (Sat) and 31 (Sun) are non-business. So in July, 5 + 5 = 10 business days.\n\nThen in August, from August 1 (Mon) to August 23 (Tue). Let's count the business days. August 1 is Monday, 2 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 4 Thursday, 5 Friday, 6 Saturday (non), 7 Sunday (non), 8 Monday, 9 Tuesday, 10 Wednesday, 11 Thursday, 12 Friday, 13 Saturday (non), 14 Sunday (non), 15 Monday, 16 Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday, 20 Saturday (non), 21 Sunday (non), 22 Monday, 23 Tuesday.\n\nSo from August 1 to August 23, the business days are:\n\nMon (1), Tue (2), Wed (3), Thu (4), Fri (5), Mon (8), Tue (9), Wed (10), Thu (11), Fri (12), Mon (15), Tue (16), Wed (17), Thu (18), Fri (19), Mon (22), Tue (23). Let's count these:\n\nFrom 1-5: 5 days.\n\nThen 8-12: 5 days (Mon to Fri).\n\nThen 15-19: 5 days (Mon to Fri).\n\nThen 22-23: 2 days (Mon and Tue).\n\nTotal in August: 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 17 days.\n\nSo total business days in July (10) plus August (17) is 27. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 27.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because in July, the first week (July 17-23) includes 5 business days (Mon-Fri) from 18-22, then the next week (July 25-31) includes 5 business days (Mon-Fri). So 5 + 5 = 10. Then August has 17 business days. 10 + 17 = 27. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the total days again. 38 total days. 38 - 11 weekend days = 27. So that's correct. So the answer is 27.\n</think>", "27"], [99, "Between Wednesday, May 18, 2022 and Friday, June 3, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Tuesday occur?

So I need to figure out all the Tuesdays in that time frame.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates. Let me start by confirming the dates. The period starts on Wednesday, May 18, 2022, and ends on Friday, June 3, 2022. So I need to count all the Tuesdays from May 18 to June 3, including both start and end dates.\n\nWait, but the start date is a Wednesday. So the first day of the period is Wednesday, May 18. Then the next day is Thursday, May 19, then Friday, May 20, Saturday, May 21, Sunday, May 22, Monday, May 23, Tuesday, May 24. So the first Tuesday in the period is May 24, 2022. Then the next Tuesday would be May 31, right? Because May has 31 days. Let me check that. May 24 is a Tuesday. Then adding 7 days: May 24 +7 is May 31. Then June 7 would be the next Tuesday, but June 7 is after June 3. So the period ends on June 3. So in May, there are two Tuesdays: May 24 and May 31. Then in June, the first day is June 1, which is a Wednesday (since May 31 is a Tuesday, so June 1 is Wednesday). Then June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday. So there are no Tuesdays in June within this period. Therefore, total Tuesdays would be 2?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the dates. Let me verify the actual days. Let me check May 18, 2022. Let me check what day of the week that was. Wait, I think May 18, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me confirm. For example, May 16, 2022 was a Monday. Then May 17 is Tuesday, May 18 is Wednesday. So that's correct. So May 18 is Wednesday. Then May 24 is the next Tuesday. Then May 24 +7 is May 31. Then June 7 is the next Tuesday.

Let me check if May 31 is within the period. The period ends on June 3. So May 31 is included. So yes. So that's two Tuesdays. But maybe I need to check if there's another one. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nStarting from May 18 (Wednesday), the days go:\n\nMay 18: Wed\n\nMay 19: Thu\n\nMay 20: Fri\n\nMay 21: Sat\n\nMay 22: Sun\n\nMay 23: Mon\n\nMay 24: Tue (first Tuesday)\n\nThen May 25: Wed\n\nMay 26: Thu\n\nMay 27: Fri\n\nMay 28: Sat\n\nMay 29: Sun\n\nMay 30: Mon\n\nMay 31: Tue (second Tuesday)\n\nThen June 1: Wed\n\nJune 2: Thu\n\nJune 3: Fri\n\nSo yes, only two Tuesdays in that period. So the answer is 2. But wait, maybe I should check if the end date is included. The problem says \"counting both dates\", so May 18 and June 3 are included. So the first Tuesday is May 24, which is within the period. Then May 31 is also included. So that's two. Therefore, the answer is 2. Hmm. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for May 31. Let me check. If May 24 is Tuesday, then adding 7 days is May 31. So that's correct. So yes, two Tuesdays. So the answer is 2.\n</think>", "2"], [99, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 24 to Friday, June 24, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Express your answer as a number.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between April 24, 2022 (Sunday) and June 24, 2022 (Friday), inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe break it down month by month. Let's check the dates. April 24 to June 24. April has 30 days, so from April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (including April 24). Then May has 31 days, and then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. Wait, but need to check if the start and end dates are included. The problem says including both start and end dates. So April 24 is Sunday, and June 24 is Friday.\n\nLet me first find the total number of days between April 24 and June 24, inclusive. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the number of weeks and days. Let's see. Let me check the dates.\n\nFirst, April 24, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check online, but since I can't, maybe I can calculate. Let me think. Let's take a known date. For example, April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday, April 4 is Monday, etc. Wait, but that might not be correct. Wait, maybe I should check. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 24 is Sunday. Let me check. Let's see, if April 1 is a Friday, then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. Then April 4 is Monday. So April 1 is Friday, April 8 is Friday again. So April 24 would be 24 - 1 = 23 days after April 1. 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So April 1 + 3 weeks is April 8, then + 2 days is April 10? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I should use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 24 is a Sunday. Let me just take that as given. So April 24 is Sunday. Then April 25 is Monday, April 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. Then May has 31 days. So May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, etc. Then June 1 is a Tuesday? Wait, let's check. May has 31 days. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 7 is Sunday, May 14, 21, 28. Then May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So June 1 is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, May 31 is Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. Wait, but if May 31 is Tuesday, then June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday, June 5 is Sunday, June 6 is Monday, and so on. The end date is June 24, which is a Friday. Let me check that. Let's count from June 1 (Wednesday) to June 24. Let's see, June 1 is Wednesday, June 2 Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday, 7 Tuesday, 8 Wednesday, 9 Thursday, 10 Friday, 11 Saturday, 12 Sunday, 13 Monday, 14 Tuesday, 15 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 17 Friday, 18 Saturday, 19 Sunday, 20 Monday, 21 Tuesday, 22 Wednesday, 23 Thursday, 24 Friday. So June 24 is Friday. That's correct. So the end date is Friday.\n\nNow, the start date is April 24 (Sunday) and end date is June 24 (Friday). Now, I need to count the number of weekdays (Monday-Friday) in this period.\n\nLet me break it down into months. First, April 24 to April 30, then May, then June 1 to June 24.\n\nFirst, April 24 (Sunday) to April 30 (Saturday). Let's count the days here. April 24 is Sunday, 25 Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So that's 7 days. So from April 24 to April 30 inclusive. Now, the weekdays here are Monday (25), Tuesday (26), Wednesday (27), Thursday (28), Friday (29). So that's 5 weekdays. Then Saturday (30) is a weekend. So in April, from 24 to 30, there are 5 weekdays.\n\nThen May. May has 31 days. Let's see. May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday, 2 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 4 Wednesday, 5 Thursday, 6 Friday, 7 Saturday, 8 Sunday, etc. So in May, each week has 5 weekdays. How many weeks are in May? May has 31 days. Let's see, 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks would be 28 days, and 3 days left. So the first 28 days of May (May 1 to May 28) would have 4 weeks, so 4*5=20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days are May 29 (Sunday), 30 (Monday), 31 (Tuesday). So in those three days, the weekdays are Monday and Tuesday. So that's 2 more. So total weekdays in May would be 20 + 2 = 22. Wait, but wait, May 1 is Sunday. So the first week (May 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri). Then May 8-14, same. Then 15-21, 22-28. Then 29-31. So the last three days (29,30,31) are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So the weekdays in those are Monday and Tuesday. So yes, 2. So total 20 + 2 = 22 weekdays in May.\n\nThen June. June 1 is Wednesday. June 1 is Wednesday, 2 Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday, 7 Tuesday, 8 Wednesday, etc. The end date is June 24, which is Friday. So from June 1 to June 24. Let's count the days. June 1 is Wednesday, June 24 is Friday. Let's see how many days that is. From June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. Let's check how many weeks and days. 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 3 days. So 3 weeks is 21 days, then 3 days: June 22 (Wednesday), 23 (Thursday), 24 (Friday). Wait, but June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 (W), 2 (Th), 3 (F), 4 (Sa), 5 (Su), 6 (M), 7 (T), 8 (W), 9 (Th), 10 (F), 11 (Sa), 12 (Su), 13 (M), 14 (T), 15 (W), 16 (Th), 17 (F), 18 (Sa), 19 (Su), 20 (M), 21 (T), 22 (W), 23 (Th), 24 (F). So from June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. Now, the weekdays in this period are all the days except Saturday and Sunday. Let's count. The first week (June 1-7): 3 weekdays (W, Th, F). Then June 8-14: 3 weekdays (W, Th, F). June 15-21: 3 weekdays (W, Th, F). Then June 22-24: 3 days (W, Th, F). Wait, but June 22 is Wednesday, 23 Thursday, 24 Friday. So that's 3 weekdays. So total for June is 3 weeks (each with 3 weekdays) plus 3 days. Wait, but 3 weeks is 21 days, and 3 days. So 3*3=9, plus 3? Wait, no. Wait, the first three weeks (June 1-21) would be 3 weeks (21 days) with 3 weekdays each? Wait, no. Wait, each week has 5 weekdays. Wait, but in the first week (June 1-7), the weekdays are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (3 days). Then the next week (June 8-14) would be Wednesday, Thursday, Friday again (3 days). Then June 15-21: same. Then June 22-24 is three days. So total weekdays in June would be 3*3 (for the first three weeks) plus 3 (the last three days). Wait, but that would be 12 weekdays. But that can't be right. Wait, because in each week, there are 5 weekdays. But in the first week (June 1-7), the weekdays are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (3 days) because the first day is Wednesday. So that's 3 weekdays. Then the next week (June 8-14) starts on Wednesday again. So same thing. So each of those weeks has 3 weekdays. Then the next week (June 15-21) same. Then June 22-24 is three days. So total is 3*3 (for the first three weeks) plus 3 (last three days) = 12. But that seems low. Wait, but June 1 is Wednesday. So in the first week (June 1-7), the weekdays are Wednesday (1), Thursday (2), Friday (3). Then Saturday (4), Sunday (5), Monday (6), Tuesday (7). Wait, no. Wait, June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Wednesday, 2 Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday, 7 Tuesday. So in that week, the weekdays are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday. That's 5 weekdays. Oh! Wait, I made a mistake earlier. Because in the first week, June 1-7, the weekdays are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday. So that's 5 weekdays. Then the next week (June 8-14): 8 is Wednesday, 9 Thursday, 10 Friday, 11 Saturday, 12 Sunday, 13 Monday, 14 Tuesday. Again, 5 weekdays. Then June 15-21: same. Then June 22-24: 22 is Wednesday, 23 Thursday, 24 Friday. So that's 3 weekdays. So total for June is 3 weeks (each with 5 weekdays) plus 3 days. Wait, but June 1-21 is 21 days, which is 3 weeks. So 3*5=15 weekdays. Then June 22-24 is 3 days, which are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So 3 weekdays. So total in June is 15 + 3 = 18 weekdays. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So earlier mistake was in thinking that the first week only had 3 weekdays, but actually, in each week, there are 5 weekdays. Because even though the first day is Wednesday, the week includes Monday and Tuesday as well. So the first week (June 1-7) has 5 weekdays. So that's correct. So June has 18 weekdays.\n\nSo adding up:\n\nApril: 5 weekdays (from 24-30)\n\nMay: 22 weekdays\n\nJune: 18 weekdays\n\nTotal: 5 + 22 + 18 = 45?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Wait, April 24 to April 30 is 7 days. The weekdays are 5 (Mon-Fri). Then May has 22, June 18. So 5+22=27, plus 18 is 45. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between April 24 and June 24 inclusive, then subtract the number of weekends.\n\nTotal days: Let's calculate. From April 24 to June 24 inclusive. April has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30 is 7 days. Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. Wait, but that's 7 (April) + 31 (May) + 24 (June) = 62 days. But wait, if April 24 is day 1, then April 25 is day 2, etc. So total days from April 24 to June 24 inclusive is 62 days. Let me check that. April 24 to April 30 is 7 days. Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So 7 + 31 + 24 = 62. Yes. So total days is 62.\n\nNow, how many weekends are there in these 62 days? Weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So need to count the number of Saturdays and Sundays between April 24 and June 24 inclusive.\n\nLet me check. April 24 is Sunday. So April 24 is Sunday. Then April 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. So in April, the weekends are April 24 (Sunday), 30 (Saturday). So that's 2 weekends in April.\n\nThen May: May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, ..., May 7 is Sunday. So each week has two weekends. May has 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks would have 4*2=8 weekends. Then the remaining 3 days are May 29 (Sunday), 30 (Monday), 31 (Tuesday). So that's one more Sunday. So total weekends in May: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nThen June: June 1 is Wednesday. So the first weekend in June is June 4 (Saturday) and June 5 (Sunday). Then next weekends are June 11, 12; 18, 19; 25, 26. But the end date is June 24. So let's check. June 1 is Wednesday. So June 4 is Saturday, 5 Sunday. Then June 11 (Saturday), 12 (Sunday). June 18 (Saturday), 19 (Sunday). June 25 (Saturday), 26 (Sunday). But June 24 is Friday. So in June, the weekends are June 4,5; 11,12; 18,19. That's 3 weekends (each with 2 days) = 6 days. So in June, 6 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period: April (2) + May (9) + June (6) = 17.\n\nSo total days is 62. Subtract weekends (17) gives 62 - 17 = 45 weekdays. Which matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 45.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because in the first approach, I had 5 (April) + 22 (May) + 18 (June) = 45. So that's correct. So the answer is 45.\n\nBut let me check again the weekends. April has 2 weekends (24 and 30). May has 9. Let me count again. May 1 is Sunday. So the first weekend is May 1 (Sunday) and May 2 (Monday)? No, wait, weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So in May, the first weekend is May 1 (Sunday) and May 7 (Saturday)? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday. So the first weekend is May 1 (Sunday) and May 2 is Monday. Wait, no. Wait, weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So in May, the first weekend is May 1 (Sunday) and May 7 (Saturday)? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Sunday. Then the next Saturday is May 7. So the first weekend in May is May 1 (Sunday) and May 7 (Saturday)? Wait, that's not correct. Because May 1 is Sunday, then the next Saturday is May 7. So the weekend days in May would be May 1 (Sunday), May 2 (Monday) is not a weekend. Wait, no. Wait, weekends are"], [99, "If today is Wednesday, March 30, 2022, what day of the week was it 2 days ago? Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking, if today is Wednesday, March 30, 2022, what day of the week was it 2 days ago? And I need to answer with the complete weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of just \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what day it was two days before Wednesday. Let me think. If today is Wednesday, then yesterday would be Tuesday. So one day ago was Tuesday. Then two days ago would be Monday. Wait, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count backward. Let's start from today, March 30, 2022, which is a Wednesday. Subtract one day: March 29, 2022, would be Tuesday. Subtract another day: March 28, 2022, would be Monday. So yes, two days ago would be Monday. \n\nBut wait, sometimes when people talk about days, they might get confused with the order. Let me confirm. If today is Wednesday, then yesterday is Tuesday (1 day ago), and the day before that is Monday (2 days ago). So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar. But since I don't have a calendar in front of me, I need to rely on my knowledge of the days. Let me think of another way. If I know that March 30 is Wednesday, then March 29 is Tuesday, March 28 is Monday. So two days ago would be Monday. \n\nI think that's right. So the answer should be Monday. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any possibility of a mistake here. For example, sometimes when dealing with dates, especially across months, there might be issues. But March 30 is a Wednesday. March 29 is the previous day, which is Tuesday. Then March 28 is Monday. So no problem here. \n\nAnother way to think about it: if today is Wednesday, then 7 days ago was also a Wednesday. So 7 days before March 30 is March 23, which is also a Wednesday. But that's not relevant here. But if I go back two days from March 30, it's March 28, which is Monday. \n\nYes, I think that's correct.

And I need to answer with the complete weekday name. Alright, so first, I need to figure out how to calculate the day of the week 56 days before Tuesday, February 8, 2022.\n\nHmm, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 56 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that. 56 divided by 7 is 8. Oh, so 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. That means 56 days ago would be the same day of the week as today. Wait, but that would mean 56 days ago was also a Tuesday? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if there's something I'm missing here.\n\nWait, maybe I should verify this. Let's think about it. If today is Tuesday, then 7 days ago was also a Tuesday. 14 days ago, another Tuesday, and so on. So 56 days is 8 times 7, so yes, 8 weeks. Therefore, 56 days ago would be the same day of the week. So the answer should be Tuesday. But wait, maybe there's a trick here? Like maybe the date is not exactly 56 days back? Let me check the actual dates to make sure.\n\nWait, the problem says today is February 8, 2022. Let me check what date is 56 days before that. Let's count backwards. Let's start from February 8, 2022. Subtract 56 days. Let me break it down. Let's see, 56 days is 8 weeks. So subtracting 7 days each time. So 7 days before February 8 is January 31, 2022. Then 14 days before is January 24, 2022. 21 days before is January 17, 2022. 28 days before is January 10, 2022. 35 days before is January 3, 2022. 42 days before is December 27, 2021. 49 days before is December 20, 2021. 56 days before is December 13, 2021. Wait, so December 13, 2021. Now, what day of the week was that?\n\nBut wait, if I subtract 56 days from February 8, 2022, which is a Tuesday, then according to the calculation, it should be the same day of the week. But maybe I need to check if that's correct. Let me check the actual day of the week for December 13, 2021. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check the number of days in each month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. So if today is Tuesday, then 56 days ago would also be Tuesday. But maybe there's a problem with leap years or something? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year. So February has 28 days. But since we're going back 56 days, which is 8 weeks, regardless of the month, the day of the week should be the same. So maybe the answer is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let me try to count backwards. Let's start from February 8, 2022. Let's subtract 56 days. Let's break it down into months. Let's see, February has 28 days in 2022. So if I go back from February 8, subtracting 28 days would take me to January 10, 2022. Then subtract another 28 days would take me to December 12, 2021. Wait, but that's 56 days. Wait, 28 + 28 is 56. So 56 days before February 8 is December 12, 2021? Wait, but earlier when I subtracted 7 days each time, I got December 13. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. Let's take February 8, 2022. Subtract 28 days: February 8 minus 28 days. February has 28 days, so February 8 minus 28 days would be January 8, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, if I subtract 28 days from February 8, that would be January 8, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, February 8 minus 28 days. Let's think. February 8 minus 7 days is January 31. Then minus another 7 days is January 24. Then minus another 7 days is January 17. Then minus another 7 days is January 10. So that's 28 days. So that would be January 10, 2022. Then subtract another 28 days would be December 12, 2021. Wait, but that's 56 days. So that would be December 12, 2021. But earlier when I subtracted 7 days each time, I thought it was December 13. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check again.\n\nWait, starting from February 8, 2022. Let's subtract 7 days each time:\n\n1. February 8 - 7 days = January 31 (2022)\n2. January 31 - 7 days = January 24\n3. January 24 - 7 days = January 17\n4. January 17 - 7 days = January 10\n5. January 10 - 7 days = December 27 (2021)\n6. December 27 - 7 days = December 20\n7. December 20 - 7 days = December 13\n8. December 13 - 7 days = December 6\n\nWait, so that's 8 weeks, 56 days. So 56 days ago would be December 6, 2021. Wait, but earlier when I thought of subtracting 28 days twice, I thought it was December 12. So which is correct? There's a contradiction here. Which one is right?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the second approach. Let me check again. Let's take February 8, 2022. Subtract 28 days. Let's count backwards. February 8 minus 28 days. Let's think of February as 28 days. So February 8 minus 28 days would be January 8, 2022? Wait, no. Because if you subtract 28 days from February 8, you go back 28 days. Let's think of it as going back 28 days. So February 8 minus 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from February 8. Let's subtract 28 days. Let's break it down. February has 28 days, so February 8 minus 28 days would be January 8, 2022? Wait, no. Because if you subtract 28 days from February 8, you would go back to January 8. Wait, but that's only 28 days. Wait, but if you subtract 28 days from February 8, you would be going back 28 days. Let's check with another method. Let's take February 8, 2022. Let's subtract 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from February 8. Let's subtract 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days. Let's think of it as going back 28 days. So February 8 minus 28 days is January 8, 2022? Wait, but that's only 28 days. Wait, but if you subtract 28 days from February 8, you would be going back to January 8. But that's 28 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Because if you subtract 28 days from February 8, you would be going back to January 8. But that's 28 days. Wait, but that's correct. Because February 8 minus 28 days is January 8. Wait, but then if I subtract another 28 days, that would be December 27, 2021. So 28 + 28 = 56 days. So that would be December 27, 2021. But earlier when I subtracted 7 days each time, I got December 6. So there's a contradiction here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check with a different approach. Let's use an online calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that, I need to think carefully. Let me check the dates again. Let's take February 8, 2022. Let's subtract 28 days. Let's count the days. Let's go back 28 days. Let's start from February 8. Subtract 7 days: January 31. Subtract another 7 days: January 24. Subtract another 7 days: January 17. Subtract another 7 days: January 10. That's 28 days. So that's January 10, 2022. Wait, so that's 28 days before February 8. So that's January 10. Then subtract another 28 days. So January 10 minus 28 days. Let's subtract 7 days: December 27. Then another 7 days: December 20. Then another 7 days: December 13. Then another 7 days: December 6. So that's 28 days. So 56 days before February 8 is December 6, 2021. But earlier when I thought of subtracting 28 days twice, I thought it was December 27. Wait, that was a mistake. So the correct date is December 6, 2021. So why did I think earlier that it was December 12? Because I must have made a mistake in that calculation. So the correct date is December 6, 2021. So now, I need to find out what day of the week that was.\n\nBut if 56 days ago is December 6, 2021, and today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022, then December 6, 2021, should be the same day of the week as February 8, 2022, because 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. So that would be Tuesday. But wait, maybe I need to check if that's correct. Let me check the day of the week for December 6, 2021. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's check the day of the week for a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, let me think. Wait, if February 8, 2022 is a Tuesday, then January 1, 2022 would be how many days before? Let's see. January has 31 days. So February 8 is 31 days after January 1. So if February 8 is Tuesday, then January 1 is 31 days before. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So if February 8 is Tuesday, then January 1 would be 3 days before Tuesday. So Tuesday minus 3 days is Saturday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So that's correct. So if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then December 31, 2021 would be the day before January 1, 2022. So December 31, 2021 is Friday. Then December 31 is Friday. So December 31, 2021 is Friday. Then December 30 is Thursday, December 29 is Wednesday, December 28 is Tuesday, December 27 is Monday, December 26 is Sunday, December 25 is Saturday, December 24 is Friday, December 23 is Thursday, December 22 is Wednesday, December 21 is Tuesday, December 20 is Monday, December 19 is Sunday, December 18 is Saturday, December 17 is Friday, December 16 is Thursday, December 15 is Wednesday, December 14 is Tuesday, December 13 is Monday, December 12 is Sunday, December 11 is Saturday, December 10 is Friday, December 9 is Thursday, December 8 is Wednesday, December 7 is Tuesday, December 6 is Monday. Wait, so December 6, 2021 is a Monday? But according to the previous calculation, 56 days ago from Tuesday, February 8, 2022, should be Tuesday. But according to this, December 6, 2021 is Monday. That's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then let's count the days from January 1 to December 6, 2021. Wait, December 6 is 365 - 31 (January) - 28 (February) - 31 (March) - 30 (April) - 31 (May) - 30 (June) - 31 (July) - 31 (August) - 30 (September) - 31 (October) - 30 (November) + 6 (December). Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, December 6 is 365 days minus the days from December 6 to December 31, 2021. Wait, maybe I should count the days from January 1 to December 6, 2021. Let me do that step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). So February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 6. So adding up the days from January 1 to December 6, 2021:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober: 31\nNovember: 30\nDecember: 6\n\nLet me add these up:\n\n31 + 28 = 59\n59 + 31 = 90\n90 + 30 = 120\n120 + 31 = 151\n151 + 30 = 181\n181 + 31 = 212\n212 + 31 = 243\n243 + 30 = 273\n273 + 31 = 304\n304 + 30 = 334\n334 + 6 = 340 days.\n\nSo from January 1, 2022 (which is Saturday) to December 6, 2021 is 340 days before. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1, 2022 is day 0, then December 6, 2021 is 340 days before. But that would mean that December 6, 2021 is 340 days before January 1, 2022. But that's not possible. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then December 31, 2021 is the day before, which is Friday. So December 31, 2021 is Friday. Then December 30 is Thursday, December 29 is Wednesday, December 28 is Tuesday, December 27 is Monday, December 26 is Sunday, December 25 is Saturday, December 24 is Friday, December 23 is Thursday, December 22 is Wednesday, December 21 is Tuesday, December 20 is Monday, December 19 is Sunday, December 18 is Saturday, December 17 is Friday, December 16 is Thursday, December 15 is Wednesday, December 14 is Tuesday, December 13 is Monday, December 12 is Sunday, December 11 is Saturday, December 10 is Friday, December 9 is Thursday, December 8 is Wednesday, December 7 is Tuesday, December 6 is Monday. So according to this, December 6, 2021 is Monday. But according to the previous calculation, 56 days ago from Tuesday, February 8, 2022, should be Tuesday. But according to this, it's Monday. So there's a contradiction here. Which means that my initial assumption that 56 days is exactly 8 weeks"], [99, "Tell me whether 1999 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1999 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1999 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1999 divided by 4. 4 times 499 is 1996, so 1999 minus 1996 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 1999 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check the rules to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nThe rules are: 1) divisible by 4, 2) if divisible by 100, then must also be divisible by 400. So, if a year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year. But if it's divisible by 100 but not by 400, it's not. But 1999 isn't even divisible by 100. Let me confirm that. 1999 divided by 100 is 19.99, so no, it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition doesn't apply here. Since 1999 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me check again. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2000 minus 4 is 1996. So 1996 is divisible by 4. Then 1996 + 4 is 2000. So 1999 is one year after 1996, so 1999 would be 1996 + 3, which is 3 years away from the next multiple of 4. Therefore, 1999 is not divisible by 4. So that confirms it again. Therefore, 1999 is not a leap year. \n\nI think that's all. The answer should be No.\n</think>", "No"], [99, "How many Tuesdays are there from Sunday, September 18, 2022 to Tuesday, November 15, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Write the total number.", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many Tuesdays there are between September 18, 2022, and November 15, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem. The dates given are from Sunday, September 18, 2022, to Tuesday, November 15, 2022, and I need to count all the Tuesdays in that range, including both start and end dates.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week each of these dates falls on. Wait, the problem already says that September 18 is a Sunday and November 15 is a Tuesday. So that's helpful. But maybe I need to confirm that? Or maybe I can just use that information given.\n\nBut maybe I should verify the days to make sure. Let me think. Let's start with September 18, 2022. If that's a Sunday, then September 19 would be a Monday, 20th Tuesday, 21st Wednesday, and so on. Then October has 31 days, so maybe I need to check how many Tuesdays are in each month between September and November.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list out all the Tuesdays in each month from September to November 2022. Let's break it down month by month.\n\nStarting with September. The first Tuesday in September would be September 19, 2022, since September 18 is a Sunday. Then each subsequent Tuesday would be 7 days later. So September 19, 26, and then October 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. Wait, but wait, September has 30 days. So September 19 is a Tuesday, then adding 7 days: 26th. Then October 3rd. Let me check if that's correct. September 18 is Sunday, so 19 is Monday? Wait, no. Wait, if September 18 is Sunday, then September 19 is Monday. Wait, that would mean that the first Tuesday would be September 20? Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if September 18 is a Sunday, then September 19 is Monday, September 20 is Tuesday. Oh, right! So the first Tuesday in September is the 20th. Then the next ones would be 27th, and then October 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th, and November 1st, 8th, 15th. Wait, but November 15 is the end date, which is a Tuesday. So that's included.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me count the Tuesdays in each month step by step.\n\nFirst, September 2022. Since September 18 is Sunday, then:\n\n- September 18: Sunday\n- 19: Monday\n- 20: Tuesday (first Tuesday)\n- 21: Wednesday\n- 22: Thursday\n- 23: Friday\n- 24: Saturday\n- 25: Sunday\n- 26: Monday\n- 27: Tuesday (second Tuesday)\n- 28: Wednesday\n- 29: Thursday\n- 30: Friday\n\nSo in September, there are two Tuesdays: 20th and 27th. Wait, but September has 30 days. So the next Tuesday after 27th would be October 4th. So that's two Tuesdays in September.\n\nThen October 2022. Let's check. October has 31 days. Let's see, the first Tuesday in October is October 4th. Then each week after that. So:\n\nOctober 4, 11, 18, 25. Then November 1st would be the next one. Wait, but October has 31 days, so October 31 is a Tuesday? Wait, let me check. Let's see, October 4 is Tuesday. Then adding 7 days: 11, 18, 25. Then 25 +7 is November 1. So October has four Tuesdays: 4, 11, 18, 25. That's four.\n\nThen November 2022. The first Tuesday in November is November 1st. Then 8th, 15th. Since November 15 is the end date, which is a Tuesday. So November has three Tuesdays: 1, 8, 15. Wait, but November has 30 days. So November 1 is Tuesday, then 8, 15, 22, 29. Wait, that's five Tuesdays. Wait, but the end date is November 15. So if the end date is November 15, which is a Tuesday, then November 15 is included. So how many Tuesdays are in November?\n\nWait, let me check again. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then the Tuesdays would be 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. But since the end date is November 15, then the last Tuesday is 15th. So that's three Tuesdays in November: 1, 8, 15. Wait, but wait, November 1 is included. So that's three Tuesdays. Wait, but if November 1 is a Tuesday, then November 1 is the first, then 8, 15. So three Tuesdays. But wait, November 29 is also a Tuesday, but that's after November 15. So that's not included. So November has three Tuesdays in the given range.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says from September 18 to November 15 inclusive. So November 1 is within that range. So November 1, 8, 15. So three Tuesdays in November.\n\nSo adding up: September has 2, October has 4, November has 3. Total is 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 Tuesdays. But wait, let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the dates. Let me list all the Tuesdays between the given dates.\n\nStarting with September 20, 27. Then October 4, 11, 18, 25. Then November 1, 8, 15. That's 2 + 4 + 3 = 9. So that's 9 Tuesdays. But wait, let me check if all these dates are within the range.\n\nThe start date is September 18, which is a Sunday. So the first Tuesday is September 20, which is after the start date. The end date is November 15, which is a Tuesday. So all the Tuesdays listed are within the range. So that's 9 Tuesdays. But wait, maybe I need to check if there's any other Tuesday that I missed.\n\nWait, let me check the dates again. Let's list them:\n\nSeptember: 20, 27.\n\nOctober: 4, 11, 18, 25.\n\nNovember: 1, 8, 15.\n\nThat's 2 + 4 + 3 = 9. So that's 9 Tuesdays. But wait, maybe I should check if the first Tuesday is indeed September 20. Since September 18 is Sunday, then 19 is Monday, 20 is Tuesday. Yes. Then 27 is the next. Then October 4th. Then October 11th, 18th, 25th. Then November 1st, 8th, 15th. So that's correct. So 9 Tuesdays. But wait, maybe I need to check if the end date is included. The end date is November 15, which is a Tuesday, so that's included. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but that might not be accurate because the start and end days might not align. But since the start is a Sunday and the end is a Tuesday, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, maybe I can check the total number of weeks between the dates. Let me try that.\n\nFrom September 18 to November 15. Let's calculate the total number of days. Let's see:\n\nSeptember has 30 days. From September 18 to September 30 is 12 days (since 30 - 18 = 12, but including both days? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on September 18, then the number of days from September 18 to September 30 inclusive is 30 - 18 + 1 = 13 days. Wait, but that's if you include both start and end. But maybe I need to calculate the total days between the two dates.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the total days between the two dates. Let me do that.\n\nFirst, September 18 to September 30: 30 - 18 = 12 days, but since September 18 is included, the number of days from September 18 to September 30 inclusive is 13 days. Then October has 31 days, and November 1 to November 15 is 15 days. So total days is 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. Wait, but that's the total number of days from September 18 to November 15 inclusive. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, September 18 to September 30: 30 - 18 + 1 = 13 days. Then October has 31 days, so adding that gives 13 + 31 = 44 days. Then November 1 to November 15 is 15 days. So total is 44 + 15 = 59 days. So 59 days in total.\n\nNow, if there are 59 days, then the number of weeks is 59 divided by 7. 7*8=56, so 56 days is 8 weeks, which is 56 days. Then there are 3 days remaining. So 8 weeks would have 8 Tuesdays, and then the remaining 3 days would include one more Tuesday if the first day is a Sunday. Wait, but the first day is a Sunday. So the first day is Sunday, September 18. Then the next day is Monday, then Tuesday. So the first week (days 1-7) would have one Tuesday (day 3). Then each subsequent week would have one Tuesday. So in 56 days, there are 8 Tuesdays. Then the remaining 3 days are days 57, 58, 59. Let's see what day of the week those are.\n\nSince September 18 is Sunday, day 1 is Sunday. Then day 57 would be 57 days later. Let's calculate 57 days from September 18. Since 56 days is exactly 8 weeks, so day 56 is the same as day 1, which is Sunday. Then day 57 is Monday, day 58 is Tuesday, day 59 is Wednesday. So the remaining 3 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So that's one more Tuesday. So total Tuesdays would be 8 + 1 = 9. Which matches the previous count. So that's 9 Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer is 9.\n\nBut wait, the problem says inclusive of both dates. So the first day is Sunday, September 18, which is included. The last day is Tuesday, November 15, which is included. So according to the calculation, there are 9 Tuesdays. So that's the answer. Therefore, the answer is 9.\n</think>", "9"], [99, "Determine the day of the month for the last Saturday in November 2022. Give the count numerically. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the last Saturday in November 2022. Let me start by recalling what day November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the days of the week for November 2022. Let me try to list out the dates and their corresponding days. But since I don't have a calendar in front of me, I need to calculate it. Let me think. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then November 2 is Wednesday, 3 is Thursday, 4 is Friday, 5 is Saturday. So the first Saturday is the 5th. Then each week after that would be adding 7 days. So the next Saturday would be the 12th, 19th, and 26th. Then the next one would be December 3rd, but that's outside of November. So the last Saturday in November would be the 26th. Wait, but wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check again. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then:\n\n1: Tuesday\n\n2: Wednesday\n\n3: Thursday\n\n4: Friday\n\n5: Saturday (first Saturday)\n\nThen adding 7 days: 5 +7=12, so 12th is Saturday. Then 19th, 26th. Then 26 +7=33, which is December 1st. So November has 30 days. So 26th is the last Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be 26. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me confirm the day of the week for November 1, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another approach. Let me think about known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, I think that's not right. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Let me check. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no, because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 would start on a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can check a specific date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022, was a Monday. Let me see. July 4, 2022, is a Monday. Then July 1 is a Friday. Let me count the days from July 1 to November 1. July has 31 days, so July 1 is Friday. Then August has 31 days, September 30, October 31, November 30. Wait, but I need to find November 1. Let me calculate the number of days from July 1 to November 1. July has 31 days, so July 1 to July 31 is 30 days (since July 1 is day 0). Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then September 30, adding 30. Then October 31, adding 31. Then November 1 is 31 days after October 31. Wait, no. Wait, from July 1 to November 1 is July (31 days) minus 1 day (since July 1 is the start) plus August (31) + September (30) + October (31) days. Wait, maybe I should count the days between July 1 and November 1. Let me think. July 1 is day 0. Then July has 31 days, so July 1 to July 31 is 30 days later. Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then September has 30 days, adding 30. Then October has 31 days, adding 31. So total days from July 1 to November 1 is 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 days. Wait, but that's from July 1 to November 1. So if July 1 is a Friday, then adding 122 days. Let me calculate 122 days later. Since 7 days a week, 122 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Friday would be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So November 1 would be a Wednesday? Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought that November 1 was a Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let me count the days from July 1 to November 1. July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 31 is 30 days (since July 1 is day 0). Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then September has 30 days, adding 30. Then October has 31 days, adding 31. So total days from July 1 to November 1 is 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 days. 122 divided by 7 is 17*7=119, remainder 3. So 17 weeks and 3 days. So if July 1 is a Friday, then adding 3 days would be Friday + 3 days = Monday (Friday +1 is Saturday, +2 is Sunday, +3 is Monday). Therefore, November 1, 2022, would be a Monday? Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022, was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is 3 days before that. So July 1 would be a Friday (since July 4 is Monday, July 3 is Sunday, July 2 is Saturday, July 1 is Friday). So that's correct. Then, according to that, November 1 is 122 days later. Which is 17 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Friday (July 1) would be Monday. Therefore, November 1 is a Monday. So that would mean that my initial thought that November 1 was a Tuesday was wrong. So that's a problem. So now I need to correct my previous calculation.\n\nSo if November 1 is a Monday, then the first Saturday would be November 5th (since 1 is Monday, 2 Tuesday, 3 Wednesday, 4 Thursday, 5 Friday? Wait, no. Wait, if November 1 is Monday, then:\n\n1: Monday\n\n2: Tuesday\n\n3: Wednesday\n\n4: Thursday\n\n5: Friday\n\n6: Saturday. Oh! So the first Saturday is the 6th. Then the next ones would be 13th, 20th, 27th. Then the next would be December 4th. So November has 30 days, so the last Saturday would be the 27th. But wait, that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check again. If November 1 is a Monday, then:\n\nMonday, November 1\n\nTuesday, 2\n\nWednesday, 3\n\nThursday, 4\n\nFriday, 5\n\nSaturday, 6\n\nSo first Saturday is the 6th. Then adding 7 days: 6 +7=13, 20, 27. Then 27 +7=34, which is December 1st. So November 27 is the last Saturday. Therefore, the answer would be 27. But then why did I think earlier that November 1 was a Tuesday? Because I was wrong in my initial assumption. So now I need to figure out which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. If November 27 is a Saturday, then December 1 is 4 days later. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday? Wait, that's not matching. Wait, if November 27 is Saturday, then November 28 is Sunday, 29 Monday, 30 Tuesday, and December 1 is Wednesday. But I thought December 1 was a Thursday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for November 1. Let me check another way. Let me check the actual calendar for November 2022. Wait, since I can't look it up, I need to find another way. Let me think again. If July 4, 2022, is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday. Then, let's count the days from July 1 to November 1. July has 31 days, so July 1 to July 31 is 30 days. Then August has 31 days, September 30, October 31. So total days from July 1 to November 1 is 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 days. 122 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Friday (July 1) would be Monday (Friday + 3 days). Therefore, November 1 is a Monday. Then November 6 is Saturday. Then November 13, 20, 27. Then December 4. But if December 1 is Wednesday, then December 4 is Saturday. So that would mean that November 27 is a Saturday. But if December 1 is Wednesday, then November 27 is 4 days before December 1. So November 27 is Wednesday minus 4 days. Wednesday minus 4 days is Saturday. Yes, because Wednesday minus 1 is Tuesday, minus 2 is Monday, minus 3 is Sunday, minus 4 is Saturday. So that's correct. Therefore, November 27 is a Saturday. Then December 4 is also a Saturday. So that would mean that the last Saturday in November is the 27th. But then why did I think earlier that November 1 was a Tuesday? Because I was wrong. So the correct answer is 27?\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure. Let me check another way. Let me check the day of the week for November 1, 2022. Let me use another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 started on a Tuesday. Wait, but if January 1, 2022, was a Sunday, that would mean that 2021 started on a Monday. Wait, no. Wait, 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 would start on a Tuesday. Therefore, January 1, 2022, would be a Tuesday. But I thought that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. That must be incorrect. So maybe I need to check that again. Alternatively, I can check the actual day of the week for a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So 2022 would be one day before that, which would be Saturday. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on a Sunday, then 2022 started on a Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous thought. So now I'm confused again. Let me check this again. If 2023 starts on a Sunday, then 2022 started on a Saturday. Because 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 started on Sunday minus 1 day, which is Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then, if that's the case, then July 4, 2022, would be how many days later? Let me calculate. From January 1, 2022, to July 4, 2022. January has 31 days, February 28 (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 4. So total days: 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +4=185 days. So 185 days from January 1, 2022 (Saturday). 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday would be Tuesday. Therefore, July 4, 2022, would be a Tuesday. But I thought earlier that July 4 was a Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there's a mistake in my previous assumption. So now I'm really confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual day of the week for July 4, 2022. Let me think. I remember that July 4, 2022, was a Monday. But according to this calculation, it's a Tuesday. So which is correct? Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. January 1 to July 4. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 4. So total days from January 1 to July 4 is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 30+28=58, +31=89, +30=119, +31=150, +30=180, +4=184 days. Wait, that's 184 days. So 184 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Saturday (January 1) would be Monday. Therefore, July 4, 2022, is a Monday. That matches my previous thought. So where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, I think I added 4 days instead of 3. Wait, the calculation was 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 30+28=58, +31=89, +30=119, +31=150, +30=180, +4=184. So 184 days. So 184 divided by 7 is 26*7=182, remainder 2. So 2 days after Saturday is Monday. Therefore, July 4 is a Monday. So that's correct. Therefore, my previous calculation that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday is correct. Therefore, the day of the week for November 1, 2022, is calculated as follows: from January 1 (Saturday) to November 1. Let's calculate the number of days between January 1 and November 1. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, and November 1. Wait, no. Wait, from January 1 to November 1 is 31 (Jan) -1 (since January 1 is day 0) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 1 (Nov 1). Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, let's count the number of days from January 1 to November 1. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 31, and November 1. Wait, but November 1 is the first day of November. So the total days from January 1 to November 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb)"], [99, "In a year where Monday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "", "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find out what day of the week March 3rd is, given that January 1st is a Monday. Hmm, I need to figure out the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are in January, February, and then up to March 3rd. Since January 1st is a Monday, January has 31 days. So January 1st is Monday, then January 8th is also a Monday, and so on. But maybe I need to count the total days from January 1st to March 3rd.\n\nLet me break it down. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, the problem doesn't mention a leap year. But since the question is about a specific year where January 1st is a Monday, I need to check if that year is a leap year. Wait, but maybe the problem is not specifying, so perhaps I should assume it's not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Hmm, but maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. If it's a leap year, February would have 29 days, which would affect the total days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year. Wait, but how can I know? Wait, maybe the problem is in a year where January 1st is a Monday, but the actual year could be either a leap year or not. However, since the problem is given without any other information, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that it's a non-leap year. But maybe the problem is designed in such a way that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but that's not possible. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a specific year where January 1st is a Monday, and the answer is determined based on that. But since the problem doesn't mention the year, perhaps I need to proceed with the standard calculation. Wait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check. For example, if it's a non-leap year, February has 28 days. So from January 1st to March 3rd would be 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 3 (March) = 62 days. Wait, but wait, March 3rd is the third day of March, so from January 1st to March 3rd is 31 + 28 + 3 = 62 days? Wait, no. Wait, January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days into March, so total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 59 + 3 = 62 days. But wait, if you count from January 1st (inclusive) to March 3rd (inclusive), then the total days would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 3 (Mar) = 62 days. But if you want to find the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd, not including January 1st, then it's 61 days. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, if January 1st is day 0 (Monday), then adding days to get to March 3rd. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the number of days from January 1st to March 3rd, inclusive, and then find the difference modulo 7.\n\nWait, but the key is that if January 1st is a Monday, then each subsequent day is +1. So if I can find how many days are between January 1st and March 3rd, then divide by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead March 3rd is from Monday.\n\nSo let's calculate the total days. Let's say January 1st is day 0 (Monday). Then January 2nd is day 1 (Tuesday), etc. So March 3rd is day X. So X = (number of days from Jan 1 to March 3) - 1. Wait, no. Wait, if Jan 1 is day 0, then Jan 1 is 0 days, Jan 2 is 1 day, ..., March 3 is (number of days from Jan 1 to March 3) - 1. Wait, maybe it's easier to think of the total number of days between Jan 1 and March 3, inclusive. But if I want to find how many days after Jan 1 is March 3, then it's (total days - 1). For example, if March 3 is the 62nd day of the year, then the number of days after Jan 1 is 61 days. So the day of the week would be (61) mod 7. Because each 7 days cycle.\n\nSo first, let's calculate the total number of days from Jan 1 to March 3. Let's check:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year). Then March 3 is 3 days. So total days from Jan 1 to March 3 is 31 + 28 + 3 = 62 days. But if we are counting from Jan 1 to March 3 inclusive, that's 62 days. So the number of days after Jan 1 is 61 days. So 61 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 5 days. Because 7*8=56, 61-56=5. So 5 days after Monday. So Monday + 5 days is Saturday. Wait, but wait, if Jan 1 is Monday, then adding 5 days would be Monday + 5 = Saturday. So March 3rd would be a Saturday? But wait, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the days step by step. Let's see:\n\nJanuary 1 is Monday. Then January 8 is Monday again. So January 1 + 7 days is Monday. So January 1 is day 0 (Monday), day 7 is Monday again. So January 1 + 7 days is Monday. So January 1 + 7 days is January 8. Then January 15, 22, 29. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26. Then March 5, 12, 19, 26. Wait, March 3 is two days before March 5. So March 5 is a Monday. So March 3 would be two days before that. So March 5 is Monday, March 4 is Sunday, March 3 is Saturday. So that's consistent with the previous calculation. So March 3 is Saturday. Therefore, the answer is Saturday.\n\nBut wait, but what if the year is a leap year? Because if it's a leap year, February has 29 days. Then the total days from Jan 1 to March 3 would be 31 + 29 + 3 = 63 days. Then 63-1=62 days. 62 divided by 7 is 8*7=56, 62-56=6. So 6 days after Monday. Monday + 6 days is Sunday. But that would be different. But the problem didn't specify if it's a leap year. However, the problem says \"in a year where Monday is January 1st\". So maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then the answer would be different. But how can we know?\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is designed in such a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. But that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is in a non-leap year. But how can I be sure? Wait, maybe the problem is in a specific year where January 1 is a Monday, and the answer is determined based on that. But since the problem is given without any other information, perhaps the answer is intended to be Saturday. But maybe I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if the problem is in a leap year, then the answer would be different. But since the problem is given without any other information, perhaps the answer is Saturday. But maybe I should check with both possibilities.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then the problem would have to specify that. Since it's not specified, I think the answer is intended to be Saturday. Therefore, the answer is Saturday.\n\nBut let me check again. Let's take a real example. For example, in 2023, January 1 is a Sunday. But if we take a year where January 1 is a Monday, say 2024. Wait, 2024 is a leap year. Let me check. January 1, 2024 is a Monday. Let's check what day March 3, 2024 is. Let's count. January 1 is Monday. January has 31 days. So January 1 is Monday, January 8 is Monday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26. March 5 is Monday. So March 3 is two days before Monday, which is Saturday. Wait, but 2024 is a leap year. So according to that, March 3 is Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, if it's a leap year, the total days would be 31 + 29 + 3 = 63 days. So 63-1=62 days. 62 mod 7 is 62 /7 is 8*7=56, 62-56=6. So 6 days after Monday is Sunday. But in reality, March 3, 2024 is a Saturday. So that contradicts the calculation. Wait, so there's a mistake here. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check again. If January 1 is Monday, then the number of days from January 1 to March 3 is 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 3 (Mar) = 63 days. But if I count from January 1 (inclusive) to March 3 (inclusive), that's 63 days. So the number of days after January 1 is 62 days. So 62 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Monday is Sunday. But in reality, March 3, 2024 is a Saturday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when you count the days from January 1 to March 3, inclusive, the number of days is 63. But if you want to find the day of the week, you need to subtract 1 because January 1 is day 0. So 63 days from January 1 would be day 62. So 62 mod 7 is 62 /7 = 8*7=56, 62-56=6. So 6 days after Monday. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. But in reality, March 3, 2024 is a Saturday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2024 is a Monday is wrong. Let me check. Let me check the actual calendar for 2024. January 1, 2024 is a Monday. Let me check March 3, 2024. Let me count the days. January has 31 days. So January 1 is Monday. Then February has 29 days. So March 1 is 31 + 29 = 60 days after January 1. So March 1 is day 60. Then March 3 is day 62. So day 62. Now, 62 divided by 7 is 8*7=56, 62-56=6. So 6 days after Monday. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. But according to the actual calendar, March 3, 2024 is a Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong. What's the problem here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the day of the week. Let me check. If January 1 is Monday, then January 8 is Monday. January 15, 22, 29. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26. Then March 5 is Monday. So March 5 is Monday. Then March 4 is Sunday, March 3 is Saturday. So that's correct. So March 3 is Saturday. But according to the calculation, it's 62 days after January 1. 62 mod 7 is 6. So 6 days after Monday is Sunday. But that's conflicting. So why is that?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the problem is that when you count the days from January 1 to March 3, inclusive, the number of days is 63. But if you want to find the day of the week, you need to take (number of days - 1) mod 7. Because January 1 is day 0. So for example, if you have 1 day (January 1), it's 0 mod 7. If you have 2 days (January 1 and 2), then day 1 is 1 mod 7. So the formula is (number of days - 1) mod 7. So in this case, 63 days from January 1 to March 3 inclusive. So (63 - 1) = 62 days. 62 mod 7 is 6. So 6 days after Monday is Sunday. But according to the actual calendar, it's Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my mistake must be in the calculation of the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, January 1 is day 1. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the counting. Let me think again. If January 1 is Monday, then the day of the week for any date can be calculated by (number of days since Jan 1) mod 7. So if January 1 is day 0 (Monday), then January 2 is day 1 (Tuesday), ..., January 8 is day 7 (Monday again). So if March 3 is day X, then X = (number of days from Jan 1 to March 3) - 1. Because if March 3 is the 63rd day of the year, then the number of days since Jan 1 is 62. So 62 mod 7 is 6. So 6 days after Monday is Sunday. But according to the actual calendar, it's Saturday. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the actual number of days from January 1 to March 3 is not 63. Let me count again. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 29 days (leap year), so from February 1 to February 29 is 29 days. Then March 1 to March 3 is 3 days. So total days from January 1 to March 3 is 31 + 29 + 3 = 63 days. So that's correct. But according to the actual calendar, March 3 is Saturday. So why is the calculation giving Sunday?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the assumption that January 1 is day 0. Let me check with the actual calendar. If January 1 is Monday, then January 1 is day 0. Then January 2 is day 1 (Tuesday), ..., January 8 is day 7 (Monday). Then February 5 is day 31 + 4 = 35? Wait, January has 31 days. So January 1 is day 0. Then January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31. February 29 is day 31 + 28 = 59 (if non-leap year) or 31 + 29 = 60 (leap year). Then March 1 is day 61 (leap year). March 3 is day 63. So day 63. Then 63 mod 7 is 63 /7 = 9, remainder 0. So day 63 is 0 mod 7, which is Monday. But that contradicts the actual calendar. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, if March 3 is day 63, then 63 mod 7 is 0, which is Monday. But according to the actual calendar, March 3 is Saturday. So there's a problem here. What's wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the day numbers. Let me take a concrete example. Let's take January 1 as Monday (day 0). Then January 8 is day 7 (Monday). January 15 is day 14 (Monday). January 22 is day 21 (Monday). January 29 is day 28 (Monday). Then February 5 is day 35 (Monday). February 12 is day 42 (Monday). February 19 is day 49 (Monday). February 26 is day 56 (Monday). March 5 is day 63 (Monday). So March 5 is Monday. Therefore, March 3 is two days before that, which is Saturday. So March 3 is Saturday. But according to the calculation, day 63 is Monday. So March 5 is day 6"], [99, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Tuesday, October 11 to Thursday, October 20, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Then October 12 is Wednesday, also a weekday. October 13 is Thursday. Then Friday, October 14. Then Saturday, October 15 (weekend), Sunday, October 16 (weekend). Then October 17 is Monday, weekday.

Wait, but wait, let me count again.\n\nWait, 11-14 is 4 days. Then 17-20 is 4 days. That's 8 days. But wait, what about the 15th and 16th? Those are weekends, so they are excluded. So total weekdays would be 8?\n\nWait, but let me check each day again.

Wait, that's 8 days. Wait, but wait, 11 to 20 is 10 days total. Let me check: 20-11+1=10 days. So 10 days in total. Of those, 2 are weekends (15 and 16), so 10-2=8 weekdays. So the answer should be 8?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual dates. Let me confirm the days of the week for those dates.

So 10 days total, minus 2 weekends gives 8 weekdays. So the answer is 8. But wait, the question says \"including both start and end dates\". So the start and end dates are both included.

And I need to answer with the complete weekday name, like Monday, Tuesday, etc. Alright, so I need to figure out what day of the week March 11 falls on if January 1 is a Wednesday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1 and March 11. Let me break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think I should assume it's not a leap year. Wait, but the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\"\u2014does that imply it's a non-leap year? Hmm, maybe. But maybe I should check both possibilities? Wait, no, maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Let me think. If it's a leap year, February would have 29 days, but since the problem doesn't mention it, maybe it's safe to assume it's a common year. But maybe I should check both? Wait, but the problem is probably expecting a standard answer, so maybe it's a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 11 is 11 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 11 is 30 (January) + 28 (February) + 11 (March) = 69 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 1 is day 0. Then January 2 is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1 and March 11 is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 11 (days in March) minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I want to count the number of days from January 1 to March 11 inclusive, that's 31 + 28 + 11 = 70 days. But if I want the number of days between January 1 and March 11, not including January 1, then it's 30 + 28 + 11 = 69 days. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, if January 1 is a Wednesday, then adding 69 days later would be March 11. So the key is to find how many days are between January 1 and March 11, then compute the day of the week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of days from January 1 to March 11. Let me check again. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days to January 31 would take us to March 1. Then March 1 is 28 + 30 = 58 days after January 1? Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is day 0. Then January 1 + 30 days is January 31. Then adding 28 days would be February 28, which is 30 + 28 = 58 days after January 1. Then March 1 is 59 days after January 1. Then March 11 is 59 + 10 = 69 days after January 1. So March 11 is 69 days after January 1. So the total number of days between January 1 and March 11 is 69 days. So now, since January 1 is a Wednesday, adding 69 days to that date will give me the day of the week for March 11.\n\nNow, since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can compute 69 divided by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead March 11 is from Wednesday. Let's do that calculation. 7 times 9 is 63, so 69 minus 63 is 6. So the remainder is 6. So that means March 11 is 6 days after Wednesday. Let's count: Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday, +5 is Monday, +6 is Tuesday. So March 11 would be a Tuesday? Wait, but wait, let me check again. Wait, if January 1 is Wednesday, then adding 7 days would be Wednesday again. So 69 days is 9 weeks and 6 days. So 9 weeks later is the same day, Wednesday, and then 6 days more. So Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let me count the days step by step. January 1 is Wednesday. Let's count the days in January. January has 31 days. So January 1 is day 0. Then January 8 is day 7 (Wednesday again). Then January 15 is day 14 (Wednesday), January 22 is day 21 (Wednesday), January 29 is day 28 (Wednesday). Then February 5 is day 35 (Wednesday). Then February 12 is day 42 (Wednesday), February 19 is day 49 (Wednesday), February 26 is day 56 (Wednesday). Then March 5 is day 63 (Wednesday). Then March 12 is day 69 (Wednesday). Wait, so March 12 is Wednesday. Therefore, March 11 is two days before that, which would be Monday? Wait, that contradicts my previous answer. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nWait, this is a problem. Let me check again. If March 12 is day 69, then March 11 is day 68. So if March 12 is Wednesday, then March 11 is Tuesday. Wait, but according to the previous calculation, 69 days after January 1 is March 12. So if March 12 is Wednesday, then March 11 is Tuesday. But according to the first calculation, 69 days after January 1 is March 11. Wait, no, that's the mistake. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then day 69 is March 11? Or March 12?\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me count the days step by step. Let's take January 1 as day 0. Then January 1 is Wednesday. Then January 2 is day 1 (Thursday), and so on. So day 6 is January 7, which is Wednesday again. Then day 7 is January 8 (Thursday). Wait, no, day 0 is January 1. So day 7 is January 8. So day 7 is 7 days after January 1, which is Wednesday again. So day 7 is Wednesday. Then day 14 is Wednesday again, etc. So day 63 is Wednesday. Then day 63 is March 5 (since January has 31 days, so 31 days is day 30 (January 31). Then February has 28 days, so day 30 + 28 = day 58 is February 28. Then March 1 is day 59. March 5 is day 59 + 4 = day 63. So day 63 is March 5, which is Wednesday. Then day 64 is March 6 (Thursday), day 65 is March 7 (Friday), day 66 is March 8 (Saturday), day 67 is March 9 (Sunday), day 68 is March 10 (Monday), day 69 is March 11 (Tuesday), day 70 is March 12 (Wednesday). So according to this, March 11 is Tuesday. So that's the same as the first calculation. So why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought March 12 was day 69, but that's not correct. Because day 69 is March 11. So the correct answer is Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me count the days from January 1 to March 11. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1. Then March 11 is 10 days after March 1. So total days from January 1 to March 11 is 30 + 28 + 10 = 68 days. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous count. Wait, why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nWait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 1 is day 0. Then January 2 is day 1. So January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31. February 28 is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1 is day 59. March 11 is day 59 + 10 = day 69. So that's 69 days. So that's correct. So March 11 is day 69. So according to the previous step-by-step count, day 69 is March 11, which is Tuesday. So that's correct. So why did I get confused earlier when I thought that day 63 is March 5, then day 69 is March 11. So that's 6 days later. March 5 is Wednesday, then March 12 is Wednesday. So March 11 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another approach. Let's use the fact that January 1 is Wednesday. Let's count the days for each month. Let's list the days of the week for each date.\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (7 days later).\n\nJanuary 15: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 22: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 29: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 5: Wednesday (January 29 + 7 days is February 5).\n\nFebruary 12: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 19: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 26: Wednesday.\n\nMarch 5: Wednesday (February 26 + 7 days is March 5).\n\nMarch 12: Wednesday (March 5 + 7 days).\n\nSo March 12 is Wednesday. Therefore, March 11 is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's use modular arithmetic. The total number of days from January 1 to March 11 is 69 days. 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Wednesday. Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. So that's correct. So the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the number of days is correct. Let me count again. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days. So adding 28 days to January 31 is February 28. Then March 1 is 28 + 30 = 58 days after January 1? Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is day 0. Then January 31 is day 30. Then February 28 is day 30 + 28 = day 58. Then March 1 is day 59. Then March 11 is day 59 + 10 = day 69. So that's correct. So 69 days. So 69 mod 7 is 6. So 6 days after Wednesday is Tuesday. So the answer is Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is Tuesday.\n</think>", "Tuesday"], [99, "Determine the day of the month for the fourth Sunday in December 2022. Answer with a number.

Hmm, first, maybe I should figure out what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Because once I know that, I can count the Sundays.\n\nWait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Maybe I can work backwards. Let me think. December 2022... Let me try to recall or calculate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think. Let's take a known date. For example, December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I should check the days for some other dates. For example, I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the Sundays would be on the 3rd (since 1 is Thursday, 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, if December 1 is Thursday, then the next day, December 2 is Friday, December 3 is Saturday, December 4 is Sunday. So the first Sunday is the 4th. Then the second would be the 11th, third 18th, fourth 25th. So the fourth Sunday would be the 25th. But wait, December has 31 days. So 25th is a Sunday. Then the fifth would be the 1st of January 2023. But the question is about December 2022. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer should be 25. But wait, let me check again. If December 1 is Thursday, then:\n\nWeek 1: 1 (Thu), 2 (Fri), 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun) \u2192 first Sunday is 4th.\n\nThen next Sunday is 11th (adding 7 days), then 18th, then 25th. So fourth Sunday is 25th. That seems right. But I need to make sure that December 1, 2022, was indeed a Thursday. How can I confirm that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the fact that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So December 31, 2022, would be the day before, which would be Saturday. Because December 31, 2022, is the last day of the year. So if January 1, 2023, is Sunday, then December 31, 2022, is Saturday. Then, December 31 is Saturday. So December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday, 25 is Sunday. Wait, that would mean that December 25 is a Sunday. Then that would align with the previous calculation. So if December 25 is Sunday, then the fourth Sunday is 25th. So that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 25. But wait, let me check again. If December 25 is Sunday, then the first Sunday is 25th? Wait, no. Wait, if December 25 is Sunday, then the first Sunday would be the 25th? But that would mean that the first Sunday is the 25th, which would be the fourth Sunday. That can't be right. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous reasoning.\n\nWait, if December 31 is Saturday, then December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday, 25 is Sunday. So December 25 is Sunday. Then the Sundays in December would be 25th, 1st (next week?), but wait, December has 31 days. Wait, if December 25 is Sunday, then the next Sunday is January 1, 2023. So that would mean that December only has one Sunday? That can't be right. Wait, that's impossible. So there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe my assumption that December 31, 2022, is Saturday is wrong. Because if January 1, 2023, is Sunday, then December 31, 2022, is Saturday. But that would mean that December 25 is Sunday, and then the next Sunday is January 1. But that would mean that December has only one Sunday? That's not possible. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, maybe I got the day of the week for January 1, 2023, wrong. Let me check. Wait, I think that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. But maybe that's incorrect. Let me think. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, no. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, I think that 2022 started on a Sunday. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous statement. Wait, maybe I need to check. Let me think. Let me recall that 2021 started on a Monday. So 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on Monday, then 2022 starts on Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday. So January 1, 2021, was a Monday. Then 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022, would be a Monday plus 1 day, which is Tuesday. So January 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Therefore, January 1, 2023, would be a Tuesday plus 365 days. Again, 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023, would be a Wednesday. Wait, but I thought it was a Sunday. So maybe I was wrong. So that's the problem. So if January 1, 2023, is a Wednesday, then December 31, 2022, would be a Tuesday. Then December 31 is Tuesday. Then December 30 is Monday, 29 is Sunday. So that would mean that December 29 is Sunday. Then the Sundays in December would be 29th, 15th, 8th, 1st. Wait, but that would make the fourth Sunday the 1st of January 2023. But that's not possible. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to find a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. If December 1 is Thursday, then December 8 is also Thursday, and so on. Then the Sundays would be on the 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th. But if December 25 is Sunday, then December 25 is Sunday. Then December 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday, 31 Saturday. So that would mean that December 31 is Saturday. Then January 1, 2023, would be Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, if January 1, 2023, is Sunday, then December 31, 2022, is Saturday. So that would be correct. But earlier, I thought that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday, but according to the calculation, if 2022 started on a Tuesday (January 1, 2022, was Tuesday), then 2023 would start on a Wednesday. Wait, but that contradicts. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual days. Let me think. Let me check the actual days for 2022. For example, I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. If that's correct, then the Sundays would be 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th. So the fourth Sunday is 25th. But if December 25 is Sunday, then December 31 is Saturday. So January 1, 2023, is Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, if 2022 started on Tuesday, then 2023 would start on Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual day of the week for December 1, 2022. Let me think. I can use the fact that January 1, 2023, is a Sunday. If that's correct, then December 31, 2022, is Saturday. Then December 31 is Saturday. So December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday, 25 is Sunday. So December 25 is Sunday. Then the Sundays in December would be 25th, 18th, 11th, 4th. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th. But that would mean that the fourth Sunday is the 25th. But if December 25 is Sunday, then the first Sunday is the 4th, second 11th, third 18th, fourth 25th. So that's correct. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer is 25. But then why is there a contradiction with the previous calculation about January 1, 2023, being a Sunday? Because if December 31, 2022, is Saturday, then January 1, 2023, is Sunday. So that's correct. So maybe my earlier calculation about 2022 starting on Tuesday was wrong. Wait, let me check again. If January 1, 2022, was a Tuesday, then 2022 has 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023, would be Tuesday + 1 day = Wednesday. But according to the other calculation, if December 31, 2022, is Saturday, then January 1, 2023, is Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the assumptions is wrong. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual day of the week for a known date. For example, I know that December 25, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. If that's correct, then December 25 is Sunday. Then December 25 is Sunday. Then December 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday, 31 Saturday. So December 31 is Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2023, is Sunday. So that would mean that 2022 started on a Tuesday? Wait, but if January 1, 2023, is Sunday, then January 1, 2022, would be Sunday minus 365 days. 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday minus 1 day is Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought it was Tuesday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong about the day of the week for January 1, 2022. Let me check. If I can find a reliable source, but since I can't, I need to think. Let me think about other dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2021, was a Monday. Then 2021 had 365 days, so 2022 started on a Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean that January 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. But according to the previous calculation, if December 31, 2022, is Saturday, then January 1, 2023, is Sunday. So that would mean that 2022 started on a Tuesday. But then 2022 has 365 days, so 2023 starts on Tuesday + 1 day = Wednesday. But according to the other calculation, it should be Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the assumptions is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the day of the week for December 25, 2022, is not Sunday. Let me think. If I can find another way. For example, I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Then December 4 is Sunday. Then the Sundays would be 4, 11, 18, 25. So December 25 is Sunday. Therefore, that would mean that December 25 is Sunday. So that's correct. Then December 31 is Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2023, is Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, if 2022 started on Tuesday, then 2023 would start on Wednesday. So there's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the starting day of 2022. \n\nWait, maybe I should check the number of days between January 1, 2021, and January 1, 2022. Since 2021 is a common year, 365 days. So 365 days later is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021, was a Monday, then January 1, 2022, would be a Tuesday. That's correct. Then 2022 has 365 days, so January 1, 2023, would be a Wednesday. But according to the other calculation, if December 31, 2022, is Saturday, then January 1, 2023, is Sunday. So this is conflicting. Therefore, one of the two must be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the day of the week for December 1, 2022, is not Thursday. Let me think. If December 1, 2022, is Thursday, then December 25 is Sunday. But if that's the case, then December 31 is Saturday. So January 1, 2023, is Sunday. But according to the other calculation, January 1, 2023, should be Wednesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in assuming that December 1, 2022, is Thursday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's check the actual days for a known date. For example, I know that December 25, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. If that's correct, then December 25 is Sunday. Then December 25 is Sunday. Then December 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday, 31 Saturday. So December 31 is Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2023, is Sunday. So that would mean that 2023 starts on Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, if 2022 started on Tuesday, then 2023 would start on Wednesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe the error is in the assumption that 2021 started on Monday. Let me check that. I think that 2021 started on a Monday. For example, January 1, 2021, was a Friday? No, I think I'm mixing up the years. Wait, I think that January 1, 2020, was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year), so 2021 started on a Thursday. Wait, that would mean that January 1, 2021, was a Thursday. Then 2021 had 365 days, so 2022 started on a Friday. Then 2022 had 365 days, so 2023 started on a Saturday. But that would mean that January 1, 2023, is Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, if December 31, 2022, is Saturday, then January 1, 2023, is Sunday. So this is conflicting. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me think about the actual days of the week for December 2022. If I can find the correct day for December 1, 2022, then I can proceed. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 25, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that.

State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 1st, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yes, that makes sense. So if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then each subsequent day adds one day. So, for example, January 2nd is Monday, and so on.\n\nNow, October 1st is 273 days after January 1st? Wait, let me count the days. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 1). Then February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and then October 1st is the first day of October. Let me add up the days from January 1 to October 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to count the number of days from January 1 to October 1. Let's see:\n\nJanuary: 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. But since we start counting from Jan 1 as day 1, then the number of days between Jan 1 and Oct 1 is (31 - 1) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 1 (Oct 1). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if I want to find the number of days from Jan 1 to Oct 1, inclusive, then it's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 1 (Oct 1)? No, that's adding up all the months up to September and then adding 1 for October 1. Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find how many days are between January 1 and October 1, inclusive, then it's the sum of the days in each month from January to September, plus 1 day for October 1. Wait, but that would be the total days from Jan 1 to Oct 1. But actually, if I want to find the number of days between Jan 1 and Oct 1, not including Jan 1, then it's the sum of the days in each month from Jan to Sep, and then add 1 for Oct 1. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of days from January 1 to October 1. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30. Then October 1 is the next day. So the total days from Jan 1 to Oct 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 1 (Oct 1)? Wait, no. Wait, if I add all the days from Jan 1 to Sep 30, that's the total days up to September 30. Then October 1 is one day after that. So the total days from Jan 1 to Oct 1 is (sum of days in Jan to Sep) + 1. Let me calculate that sum.\n\nJan: 31, Feb: 28, Mar: 31, Apr: 30, May: 31, Jun: 30, Jul: 31, Aug: 31, Sep: 30. Let's add them up step by step.\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n\n151 + 30 (Jun) = 181\n\n181 + 31 (Jul) = 212\n\n212 + 31 (Aug) = 243\n\n243 + 30 (Sep) = 273. So up to September 30, there are 273 days. Then October 1 is the next day, so 274 days from January 1. Wait, but if January 1 is day 1, then October 1 is day 274. So the number of days between January 1 and October 1 is 273 days (if you don't count the start date) or 274 days including both. Wait, maybe I need to check that again. If January 1 is day 1, then January 2 is day 2, and so on. So the number of days from January 1 to October 1 inclusive is 274 days. But if I want to find how many days after January 1, October 1 is, then it's 273 days later. Because from day 1 (Jan 1) to day 274 (Oct 1) is 273 days later.\n\nSo if January 1 is a Sunday, then adding 273 days to that date would give me the day of the week for October 1. Now, since each week has 7 days, I can divide 273 by 7 to find how many weeks and extra days. 273 divided by 7 is exactly 39 weeks, with no remainder. So 273 days later is exactly 39 weeks later, which means the same day of the week. Therefore, if January 1 is a Sunday, then October 1 would also be a Sunday. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if I check online, I think October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that again. Let me think. I remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year), so 2021 would start on a Thursday (since 366 days is 52 weeks and 2 days, so adding 2 days to Wednesday gives Friday? Wait, no. Wait, if 2020 starts on Wednesday, then 2021 starts on Wednesday + 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Wednesday would be Friday. So January 1, 2021 is a Friday. Then 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So maybe I was wrong earlier. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 273 days (which is 39 weeks) would still be Saturday. But that would mean October 1 is a Saturday. But I thought maybe it was a Sunday. Wait, but maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check the actual date. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can use another approach. Let me think of some known dates. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. July 4, 2022. If I can figure out that date, then I can count the days from there to October 1. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Let me check that again. If 2020 started on Wednesday, then 2021 started on Friday (as 366 days later is 2 days ahead). Then 2022 starts on Saturday (365 days later is 1 day ahead). So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, if that's correct, then October 1 is 273 days later. 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks, so same day. So October 1 would be Saturday. But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, let's take July 1, 2022. If January 1 is Saturday, then how many days is that? From January 1 to July 1. Let's calculate that. January has 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 30 days (since Jan 1 is day 1). Then February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 1. So adding up the days from Jan 1 to June 30: 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181. So June 30 is day 181. Then July 1 is day 182. So if January 1 is Saturday, then July 1 is 181 days later. 181 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 6 days. So 25 weeks later is Saturday, plus 6 days: Saturday + 6 days is Friday. So July 1, 2022 is a Friday. Wait, but I thought July 4 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 1 is Friday, then July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. Yes, that's correct. So July 4, 2022 is a Monday. That seems right. So that confirms that July 1 is Friday. So if that's correct, then my calculation for January 1 being Saturday is correct. Then October 1 is 273 days later, which is 39 weeks, so same day. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is Saturday. But I thought maybe it was Sunday. Wait, but according to this, it's Saturday. So maybe my initial thought was wrong. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. Let's take October 1, 2022. If I know that October 1 is Saturday, then October 2 is Sunday, and so on. Let me check another date. For example, October 1, 2022. If I know that November 4, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, but I don't remember that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if I can confirm that, then I can count back. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Wait, if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. That's correct. So if that's true, then January 1, 2023 is Sunday. So that's a known fact. Therefore, if that's correct, then my calculation for January 1, 2022 being Saturday is correct. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is also Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.\n</think>", "Saturday"], [99, "Count forward 80 days from Wednesday, July 6, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week it will be 80 days after Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Let me start by breaking this down. \n\nFirst, I know that each week has 7 days, so if I can figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 80 days, that should help me determine the weekday. Since 80 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 3 days (because 11*7=77, and 80-77=3), that means 80 days later is 11 weeks and 3 days after the starting date. \n\nSo if the starting day is Wednesday, adding 3 days would take me to Saturday. Wait, let me check that again. Wednesday plus 1 day is Thursday, plus 2 is Friday, plus 3 is Saturday. So that would make the answer Saturday? But wait, maybe I should verify this by actually counting the days step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or some kind of date calculation method. Let me think. July 6, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let me count the days forward. \n\nFirst, July has 31 days. So July 6 is Wednesday. Let's count the days in July. From July 6 to July 13 is 7 days, which is another Wednesday. Then July 13 to July 20 is another week, so that's a Wednesday again. July 20 to July 27 is another week, Wednesday. Then July 27 to August 3 is another week, Wednesday. Wait, but that's 7 days each time. So adding 7 days each time would be the same day. But 80 days is 11 weeks and 3 days. So adding 11 weeks would bring me back to Wednesday, then adding 3 days would be Saturday. \n\nBut maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the days? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. But since we're starting in July, that shouldn't affect the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try another approach. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nStarting from July 6, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count 80 days. Let's break it down into months. \n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 6 to July 31 is 31 - 6 = 25 days. Wait, but if I start on July 6, then July 7 is day 1. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days later. Wait, no. Wait, if I'm counting the days after July 6, then July 6 is day 0. So July 7 is +1 day. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days (since 31-6=25). Then August has 31 days. So adding 25 days in July, then 31 days in August would be 25 + 31 = 56 days. Then September has 30 days. So adding 30 days would be 56 + 30 = 86 days. But we need 80 days. So 56 days is 25 (July) + 31 (August) = 56. Then 80 - 56 = 24 days into September. So 24 days into September. \n\nSo starting from July 6, adding 25 days gets me to July 31. Then adding 31 days (August) would take me to August 31. Then adding 24 days into September would be September 24. Wait, but that's 25 + 31 + 24 = 80 days. So the date would be September 24, 2022. Now, I need to check what day of the week that is. \n\nBut how? Well, if July 6 is a Wednesday, then July 31 is 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So 3 weeks later is Wednesday again, then 4 days later would be Sunday. Wait, July 31 is 25 days after July 6. So 25 days is 3 weeks (21 days) plus 4 days. So Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. So July 31 is a Sunday. Then August has 31 days. So August 31 is 31 days after July 31. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So August 31 is a Wednesday. Then September 24 is 24 days after August 31. 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. Therefore, September 24, 2022 is a Saturday. \n\nSo that matches my initial calculation. So the answer should be Saturday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's count the days step by step. Starting from July 6, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count 80 days. \n\nBut maybe I can use the fact that 7 days later is the same day. So 80 divided by 7 is 11*7=77, remainder 3. So 80 days is 11 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Wednesday is Saturday. \n\nSo both methods give me Saturday.

Reply with the numerical value. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out on which date in May 2022 the second Thursday falls. Let me start by recalling that May has 31 days. First, I should check what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I can check an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I'll have to rely on my memory or logical reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me think. Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's see, if I can find the day of the week for a known date in May 2022. For example, I know that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that again. If that's correct, then the first week of May would start on Sunday, May 1. So the first Thursday would be May 5th, right? Because May 1 is Sunday, then the next days: 2 (Mon), 3 (Tue), 4 (Wed), 5 (Thu). So first Thursday is May 5. Then the second Thursday would be May 12th. Wait, but wait, if May 5 is the first Thursday, then adding seven days would be May 12, which is the second Thursday. Then the third would be May 19, and the fourth May 26. But since May has 31 days, the fifth Thursday would be June 2nd, which is outside of May. So the second Thursday is May 12th. Therefore, the answer should be 12. But wait, I need to make sure that May 1, 2022, was indeed a Sunday. Let me think again. Let me check another way. For example, I know that April 1, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is Friday, April 15, 22, and May 1 is the next Friday. Wait, April has 30 days, so April 30 is a Thursday. Then May 1 is a Friday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So if April 1 is Friday, then May 1 is Friday. Wait, that would mean that May 1 is a Friday. But that would make the first Thursday in May be April 29, which is a Thursday. Wait, but that's in April. So then May 1 is Friday. So the first Thursday in May would be May 1 minus 1 day, which is April 30, but that's in April. So the first Thursday in May would be May 2? Wait, no. Wait, if May 1 is Friday, then May 2 is Saturday, May 3 is Sunday, May 4 is Monday, May 5 is Tuesday, May 6 is Wednesday, May 7 is Thursday. Wait, that would make the first Thursday in May the 7th. Then the second Thursday would be the 14th. Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, I think I need to get the correct day of the week for May 1, 2022. Let me try to recall. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. If January 1, 2022, was a Saturday, then January 8, 15, 22, 29 are also Saturdays. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26 are Saturdays. March 5, 12, 19, 26 are Saturdays. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 are Saturdays. Then May 1, 2022, would be a Sunday. Because April 30 is a Saturday, so May 1 is Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous thought where I thought April 1 was Friday. Wait, maybe I was wrong about April 1. Let me check again. If April 30 is a Saturday, then April 29 is a Friday, April 28 is a Thursday. So April 1 would be a Thursday? Wait, no. Wait, April has 30 days. If April 30 is a Saturday, then April 29 is Friday, April 28 is Thursday, April 27 is Wednesday, etc. So April 1 would be 28 days before April 29. Since 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so April 1 would be the same day as April 29. So April 1 is a Thursday. Therefore, April 1 is a Thursday. Then April 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. Then May 1 is the next day, which is Friday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous conclusion that May 1 is Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. If January 1, 2022, is a Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Saturday. Then February 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. So April 30 is a Saturday. Therefore, May 1 is a Sunday. So that would mean that April 1 is a Thursday. Because April 1 is 28 days before April 29 (which is a Thursday). Wait, but April 29 is a Thursday. So April 1 is a Thursday. Then April 2 is Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, 6 Tuesday, 7 Wednesday, 8 Thursday. So April 8 is a Thursday. Then April 15, 22, 29 are Thursdays. Then May 6 is a Thursday. Wait, but May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, 3 Tuesday, 4 Wednesday, 5 Thursday. Wait, that would make May 5 a Thursday. So the first Thursday in May is May 5. Then the second would be May 12, third May 19, fourth May 26. So the second Thursday is May 12. But earlier I thought that if April 1 is Thursday, then May 1 is Friday. But according to this, May 1 is Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022, is a Saturday is wrong. Let me check. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022, was actually a Saturday. Let me check with another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2021, was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022, would be a Saturday. That's correct. So January 1, 2022, is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Saturday. Then February 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. So April 30 is Saturday. Therefore, May 1 is Sunday. So April 1 is Thursday. Then April 1 is Thursday. Then April 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. Then May 6 is Thursday. Wait, but May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, 3 Tuesday, 4 Wednesday, 5 Thursday. So May 5 is Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion that May 6 is Thursday. Wait, that's a problem. So if April 29 is Thursday, then May 6 is Thursday. But according to the previous calculation, May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday. So that would mean that May 5 is Thursday. But according to the other calculation, April 29 is Thursday, then adding 7 days would be May 6. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between April 29 and May 6. Let's check. April 29 is Thursday. Then April 30 is Friday. May 1 is Saturday. May 2 is Sunday. May 3 is Monday. May 4 is Tuesday. May 5 is Wednesday. May 6 is Thursday. So that's correct. So if April 29 is Thursday, then May 6 is Thursday. But according to the previous calculation, May 1 is Sunday. So that's correct. So May 5 is Wednesday, May 6 is Thursday. Therefore, the first Thursday in May is May 6. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier thought that May 5 is Thursday. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 5 is Thursday. Because May 1 (Sunday), 2 (Mon), 3 (Tue), 4 (Wed), 5 (Thu). So that would be correct. But according to the other calculation, April 29 is Thursday, then May 6 is Thursday. So that would mean that May 5 is Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. Let me check again. If April 30 is Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. So April 29 is Friday. Wait, no. Wait, April 30 is Saturday. So April 29 is Friday. Then April 28 is Thursday. So April 28 is Thursday. Then May 5 is Thursday (April 28 + 7 days). So May 5 is Thursday. Then May 6 is Friday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, I think I messed up the days. Let me list the days step by step.\n\nIf April 30 is Saturday, then:\n\nApril 29: Friday\n\nApril 28: Thursday\n\nApril 27: Wednesday\n\nApril 26: Tuesday\n\nApril 25: Monday\n\nApril 24: Sunday\n\nApril 23: Saturday\n\nApril 22: Friday\n\nApril 21: Thursday\n\nApril 20: Wednesday\n\nApril 19: Tuesday\n\nApril 18: Monday\n\nApril 17: Sunday\n\nApril 16: Saturday\n\nApril 15: Friday\n\nApril 14: Thursday\n\nApril 13: Wednesday\n\nApril 12: Tuesday\n\nApril 11: Monday\n\nApril 10: Sunday\n\nApril 9: Saturday\n\nApril 8: Friday\n\nApril 7: Thursday\n\nApril 6: Wednesday\n\nApril 5: Tuesday\n\nApril 4: Monday\n\nApril 3: Sunday\n\nApril 2: Saturday\n\nApril 1: Friday\n\nWait, but earlier I thought April 1 was Thursday. But according to this, April 1 is Friday. So that's the mistake. So if April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. Then May 6 is Friday. Wait, but April 30 is Saturday. So May 1 is Sunday. So that would mean that the first Thursday in May is May 7. Because May 1 is Sunday, 2 (Mon), 3 (Tue), 4 (Wed), 5 (Thu). Wait, that's May 5. So May 5 is Thursday. Then May 12 is the second Thursday. But according to the previous calculation, April 29 is Friday. So April 29 is Friday, then May 6 is Friday. So May 5 is Thursday. So that's correct. So the first Thursday is May 5, second is May 12. Therefore, the answer is 12. But why did I think earlier that April 1 was Thursday? Because I made a mistake in the calculation. So the correct day of the week for April 1 is Friday. Therefore, the first Thursday in May is May 5, second is May 12. Therefore, the answer is 12. So the answer should be 12.\n</think>", "12"], [99, "What day of the week was June 15, 2022?

Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can relate to. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no, because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021 was a Monday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. Wait, July 4, 2022 was a Monday. If that's the case, then I can count backwards from there. Let's see. June has 30 days, so June 15 is 15 days before July 4. Wait, no, June 15 is 15 days before July 4? Wait, June has 30 days, so June 15 to June 30 is 15 days. Then July 1 is 1 day after June 30. So July 4 is 3 days after July 1. So if July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Thursday. Then June 30 is Wednesday. So June 15 would be 15 days before June 30. Wait, but that's 15 days before June 30. Wait, June 15 is 15 days before June 30? Wait, June 15 plus 15 days is June 30. So June 15 is 15 days before June 30. So if June 30 is Wednesday, then June 15 would be 15 days earlier. Since 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So subtracting 1 day from Wednesday would be Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean June 15 is a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another approach. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that June 15, 2022 was a Wednesday.

So January 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I need to check the actual days. Let me think again. Let's take 2021. January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Wait, I think that 2021 started on a Monday. Wait, maybe I should use the fact that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days, so 2021 started on a Wednesday + 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, so 2022 started on Friday + 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday.

Wait, January 31 is a Monday (since January 31 is 30 days after January 1, which is Saturday. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So January 1 + 30 days is January 31, which is Saturday + 2 days = Monday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday. January 3 is Monday. So January 31 is 30 days after January 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days.

So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15 is Saturday, 22 is Saturday, 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days after February 1. Since February 1 is Tuesday (as January 31 is Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday). Then February 28 is 28 days later, which is 4 weeks, so same day as February 1, which is Tuesday. So March 1 is Wednesday. March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 8 is Wednesday, 15 is Wednesday, 22 is Wednesday, 29 is Wednesday. April 5 is Wednesday. April has 30 days. April 5 is Wednesday, so April 12 is Wednesday, 19 is Wednesday, 26 is Wednesday. May 3 is Wednesday. May has 31 days. May 3 is Wednesday, so May 10 is Wednesday, 17 is Wednesday, 24 is Wednesday, 31 is Wednesday. Then June 1 is Thursday. So June 1 is Thursday. Then June 15 is 14 days later. 14 days is 2 weeks, so June 15 is also Thursday. Therefore, June 15, 2022 is a Thursday. But earlier, when I thought July 4 was Monday, I thought June 15 was Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that again. If June 15 is Thursday, then June 15 + 15 days is July 1. Wait, June has 30 days. June 15 + 15 days is June 30. Then July 1 is the next day, which would be Friday. Then July 4 is 3 days after July 1, so Friday + 3 days is Monday. So that would make July 4 a Monday. So that's consistent. So if July 4 is Monday, then June 15 is Thursday. So that seems correct. Therefore, June 15, 2022 is a Thursday. But earlier, when I thought that June 15 was Tuesday, that was based on a different assumption. So I think the correct answer is Thursday. But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that June 1, 2022 is Thursday. Then June 8 is Thursday, 15 is Thursday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be Thursday.\n</think>", "Thursday"]]}
