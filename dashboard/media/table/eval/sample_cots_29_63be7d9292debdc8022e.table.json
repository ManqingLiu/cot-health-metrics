I need to find out on which date in May 2022 the first Wednesday falls. The question says to give the count numerically, so I need to figure out the day of the week for each date in May 2022 and find the first occurrence of Wednesday.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the days would go like this:\n\nMay 1: Sunday\nMay 2: Monday\nMay 3: Tuesday\nMay 4: Wednesday\n\nSo the first Wednesday would be May 4th. But wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me think again. If May 1 is a Sunday, then adding three days would make May 4 a Wednesday. That seems right. But maybe I should verify with another method. Alternatively, I can check an online calendar or use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can recall that in 2022, May had 31 days. Let me check the days for May 2022. For example, May 1 is Sunday, so the first week would have Sunday (1st), Monday (2nd), Tuesday (3rd), Wednesday (4th). So the first Wednesday is indeed the 4th. Therefore, the answer should be 4.", "4"], [99, "Between Tuesday, November 8, 2022 and Friday, December 16, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Answer with a number.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, November 8, 2022, and Friday, December 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) that fall within that period.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of days. Let's break it down month by month. November has 30 days. The period starts on November 8, so from November 8 to November 30, inclusive. Then December 1 to December 16, inclusive.\n\nWait, but I need to check if November 8 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, the question says the start date is Tuesday, November 8, 2022. So that's correct. Let me check the days in each month.\n\nFirst, November: from November 8 to November 30. How many days is that? Let's calculate. November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Wait, because inclusive. So 30 minus 8 is 22, plus 1 is 23 days. But wait, November 8 is the first day, so adding 22 days would get to November 30. So 23 days total in November.\n\nThen December: from December 1 to December 16. That's 16 days. So total days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive is 23 + 16 = 39 days.\n\nNow, out of these 39 days, how many are weekends? Let's figure out the days of the week for each month.\n\nStarting with November 8, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let's list the days of the week for each date.\n\nNovember 8 is Tuesday. Then November 9 is Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday, 13 Sunday. So the first weekend in November is November 12 (Saturday) and 13 (Sunday). Then the next weekend would be November 19 (Saturday) and 20 (Sunday), then November 26 (Saturday) and 27 (Sunday). Then December 1 is a Thursday (since November 27 is Sunday, so December 1 is the next day, which is a Thursday). Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, November 8 is Tuesday. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nNovember 8: Tuesday\n\nNovember 9: Wednesday\n\nNovember 10: Thursday\n\nNovember 11: Friday\n\nNovember 12: Saturday\n\nNovember 13: Sunday\n\nNovember 14: Monday\n\nNovember 15: Tuesday\n\nNovember 16: Wednesday\n\nNovember 17: Thursday\n\nNovember 18: Friday\n\nNovember 19: Saturday\n\nNovember 20: Sunday\n\nNovember 21: Monday\n\nNovember 22: Tuesday\n\nNovember 23: Wednesday\n\nNovember 24: Thursday\n\nNovember 25: Friday\n\nNovember 26: Saturday\n\nNovember 27: Sunday\n\nNovember 28: Monday\n\nNovember 29: Tuesday\n\nNovember 30: Wednesday\n\nSo in November, the weekends are:\n\nNovember 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun)\n\nNovember 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun)\n\nNovember 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun)\n\nThat's 3 weekends, each with 2 days, so 6 days total in November.\n\nThen December starts on Thursday, December 1. Let's check the days in December.\n\nDecember 1: Thursday\n\nDecember 2: Friday\n\nDecember 3: Saturday\n\nDecember 4: Sunday\n\nDecember 5: Monday\n\nDecember 6: Tuesday\n\nDecember 7: Wednesday\n\nDecember 8: Thursday\n\nDecember 9: Friday\n\nDecember 10: Saturday\n\nDecember 11: Sunday\n\nDecember 12: Monday\n\nDecember 13: Tuesday\n\nDecember 14: Wednesday\n\nDecember 15: Thursday\n\nDecember 16: Friday\n\nSo in December, the weekends are December 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun). That's 4 weekends, each with 2 days, so 8 days total in December.\n\nWait, but the period ends on December 16, which is a Friday. So in December, the weekends are up to December 11 (Sunday), and then December 12 is Monday. So the weekends in December are 3 and 4, 10 and 11. That's 4 days total.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period are 6 (November) + 4 (December) = 10 days.\n\nTotal days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive is 39 days. So business days would be 39 - 10 = 29 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the number of weekends again to make sure.\n\nIn November, the weekends are:\n\n12 (Sat), 13 (Sun)\n\n19 (Sat), 20 (Sun)\n\n26 (Sat), 27 (Sun)\n\nThat's 6 days. Correct.\n\nIn December, the weekends are:\n\n3 (Sat), 4 (Sun)\n\n10 (Sat), 11 (Sun)\n\nThat's 4 days. So total 10 days. So 39 total days minus 10 weekends equals 29 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check the total days again. November 8 to November 30 is 23 days. December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. 23 + 16 = 39. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by counting the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays in the period.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tuesday), let's count each day.\n\nNovember 8: Tuesday\n\nNovember 9: Wednesday\n\nNovember 10: Thursday\n\nNovember 11: Friday\n\nNovember 12: Saturday\n\nNovember 13: Sunday\n\nNovember 14: Monday\n\nNovember 15: Tuesday\n\nNovember 16: Wednesday\n\nNovember 17: Thursday\n\nNovember 18: Friday\n\nNovember 19: Saturday\n\nNovember 20: Sunday\n\nNovember 21: Monday\n\nNovember 22: Tuesday\n\nNovember 23: Wednesday\n\nNovember 24: Thursday\n\nNovember 25: Friday\n\nNovember 26: Saturday\n\nNovember 27: Sunday\n\nNovember 28: Monday\n\nNovember 29: Tuesday\n\nNovember 30: Wednesday\n\nDecember 1: Thursday\n\nDecember 2: Friday\n\nDecember 3: Saturday\n\nDecember 4: Sunday\n\nDecember 5: Monday\n\nDecember 6: Tuesday\n\nDecember 7: Wednesday\n\nDecember 8: Thursday\n\nDecember 9: Friday\n\nDecember 10: Saturday\n\nDecember 11: Sunday\n\nDecember 12: Monday\n\nDecember 13: Tuesday\n\nDecember 14: Wednesday\n\nDecember 15: Thursday\n\nDecember 16: Friday\n\nNow, let's count the number of each weekday.\n\nTuesdays: November 8, 15, 22, 29, December 6, 13, 20 (wait, December 20 is beyond the period. Wait, the period ends on December 16. So December 6, 13, and 20? Wait, December 20 is after December 16. So in December, the Tuesdays are 6 and 13. So total Tuesdays: November 8, 15, 22, 29 (4), plus December 6, 13 (2) = 6 Tuesdays.\n\nWait, November 29 is a Tuesday. Then December 6 is a Tuesday, and December 13 is a Tuesday. So that's 6 Tuesdays.\n\nSimilarly, Wednesdays: November 9, 16, 23, 30 (4), December 7, 14 (2) = 6 Wednesdays.\n\nThursdays: November 10, 17, 24, December 1, 8, 15 (6 days).\n\nFridays: November 11, 18, 25, December 2, 9, 16 (6 days).\n\nSaturdays: November 12, 19, 26, December 3, 10 (5 days).\n\nSundays: November 13, 20, 27, December 4, 11 (5 days).\n\nSo total business days would be the sum of Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays. That's 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24? Wait, but that's 24. But earlier calculation said 29. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the total days are 39. If there are 5 days of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) total, that's 10 days. So 39 - 10 = 29 business days. But according to the count of weekdays, it's 6+6+6+6=24. That's a problem. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the weekdays. Let me recount each day.\n\nLet me list all the days from November 8 to December 16 and count the business days.\n\nStarting with November 8 (Tuesday) to November 30 (Wednesday), then December 1 (Thursday) to December 16 (Friday).\n\nLet me list each day and mark if it's a business day.\n\nNovember 8: Tue (business)\n9: Wed (business)\n10: Thu (business)\n11: Fri (business)\n12: Sat (non)\n13: Sun (non)\n14: Mon (business)\n15: Tue (business)\n16: Wed (business)\n17: Thu (business)\n18: Fri (business)\n19: Sat (non)\n20: Sun (non)\n21: Mon (business)\n22: Tue (business)\n23: Wed (business)\n24: Thu (business)\n25: Fri (business)\n26: Sat (non)\n27: Sun (non)\n28: Mon (business)\n29: Tue (business)\n30: Wed (business)\nDec 1: Thu (business)\n2: Fri (business)\n3: Sat (non)\n4: Sun (non)\n5: Mon (business)\n6: Tue (business)\n7: Wed (business)\n8: Thu (business)\n9: Fri (business)\n10: Sat (non)\n11: Sun (non)\n12: Mon (business)\n13: Tue (business)\n14: Wed (business)\n15: Thu (business)\n16: Fri (business)\n\nNow, let's count the business days. Let's go through each day:\n\nNovember 8-11: 4 business days (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n12-13: non\n14-18: 5 business days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n19-20: non\n21-25: 5 business days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n26-27: non\n28-30: 3 business days (Mon, Tue, Wed)\nDec 1-2: 2 business days (Thu, Fri)\n3-4: non\n5-9: 5 business days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n10-11: non\n12-16: 5 business days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n\nNow adding them up:\n\n4 (Nov 8-11) + 5 (14-18) + 5 (21-25) + 3 (28-30) + 2 (Dec 1-2) + 5 (Dec 5-9) + 5 (Dec 12-16) = 4+5=9, +5=14, +3=17, +2=19, +5=24, +5=29. So total 29 business days. So that matches the first calculation. So where did I go wrong in the previous count of weekdays?\n\nEarlier, I thought that Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays each had 6 days. But according to this list, let's count each:\n\nTuesdays: November 8, 15, 22, 29, December 6, 13. That's 6 Tuesdays. Correct.\n\nWednesdays: November 9, 16, 23, 30, December 7, 14. That's 6 Wednesdays. Correct.\n\nThursdays: November 10, 17, 24, December 1, 8, 15. That's 6 Thursdays. Correct.\n\nFridays: November 11, 18, 25, December 2, 9, 16. That's 6 Fridays. Correct.\n\nSo 6+6+6+6=24. But according to the day-by-day count, it's 29. Wait, that's a problem. How can that be?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some days. Wait, the total number of business days is 29, but according to the sum of the weekdays, it's 24. That's a contradiction. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the day-by-day count. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the day-by-day count was:\n\nNovember 8-11: 4 days (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n14-18: 5 days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n21-25: 5 days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n28-30: 3 days (Mon, Tue, Wed)\nDec 1-2: 2 days (Thu, Fri)\n5-9: 5 days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n12-16: 5 days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n\nAdding those: 4+5=9, +5=14, +3=17, +2=19, +5=24, +5=29. So that's correct. But according to the count of each weekday, it's 6+6+6+6=24. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Wait, the day-by-day count includes all the business days, but when I count the number of each weekday, I must have missed some days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the total number of business days is 29. If each weekday (Mon-Fri) has 6 days, that would be 24. But 29 is more than 24. So that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the weekday counts.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of each weekday.\n\nTuesdays: November 8, 15, 22, 29, December 6, 13. That's 6.\n\nWednesdays: November 9, 16, 23, 30, December 7, 14. That's 6.\n\nThursdays: November 10, 17, 24, December 1, 8, 15. That's 6.\n\nFridays: November 11, 18, 25, December 2, 9, 16. That's 6.\n\nSo that's 6*4=24. But according to the day-by-day count, it's 29. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe I missed some days in the day-by-day count. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the day-by-day list:\n\nNovember 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), Dec 1 (Thu), 2 (Fri), 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri).\n\nWait, that's 29 days. Let me count them:\n\n1. Tue\n2. Wed\n3. Thu\n4. Fri\n5. Mon\n6. Tue\n7. Wed\n8. Thu\n9. Fri\n10. Mon\n11. Tue\n12. Wed\n13. Thu\n14. Fri\n15. Mon\n16. Tue\n17. Wed\n18. Thu\n19. Fri\n20. Mon\n21.

Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1940 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1940 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1940 divided by 4. 4 times 485 is 1940, right? So 4 x 485 = 1940. That means 1940 is divisible by 4. So that's the first condition satisfied.\n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 1940 divided by 100 is 19.4, which isn't a whole number. So 1940 isn't a century year. Therefore, the second condition about being divisible by 400 doesn't apply here.\n\nSince 1940 is divisible by 4 and not a century year, it should be a leap year. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me calculate 1940 divided by 4 again. 4 times 400 is 1600, subtract that from 1940, you get 340. 4 times 85 is 340. So 400 + 85 is 485. So yes, 4 x 485 is indeed 1940. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, since it's divisible by 4 and not a century year, 1940 is a leap year.", "Yes."], [99, "Determine the day of the month for the second Tuesday in November 2022.

I need to find the day of the month for the second Tuesday in November 2022. Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's the case, then the first Tuesday would be the 1st. Then the second Tuesday would be the 8th. Wait, but wait, if the first Tuesday is the 1st, then adding seven days would make the next Tuesday the 8th. So the second Tuesday would be the 8th. But I need to make sure that November 2022 actually has at least two Tuesdays. Let me check the number of days in November. November has 30 days. So if the first Tuesday is the 1st, then the second would be the 8th, third on 15th, fourth on 22nd, and fifth on 29th. That's five Tuesdays in November 2022. So the second one is definitely the 8th. Therefore, the answer should be 8. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me double-check. I think November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me think of another way to verify. For example, I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. So November has 30 days, so December 1 is 30 days after November 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if November 1 is a Tuesday, then December 1 would be Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday. Which matches what I remember. So that confirms that November 1 was a Tuesday.

Alright, so first, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 10th. Well, from the 1st to the 10th is 9 days later, right? Because if you count from the 1st to the 2nd is one day, so adding 9 days to the 1st would get you to the 10th.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Saturday, I need to count 9 days forward. But wait, days of the week cycle every 7 days. So maybe I can divide 9 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 9 divided by 7 is 1 week with a remainder of 2 days. So that means 9 days later is the same as 1 week (which brings us back to Saturday) plus 2 more days.\n\nStarting from Saturday, adding one day would be Sunday, then adding another day would be Monday.

Hmm, first, I should figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 51 days because weeks are 7 days, so dividing 51 by 7 will give me the number of weeks and the remainder will be the extra days. Let me do that calculation.\n\n51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks with a remainder of 2 days. Because 7 times 7 is 49, and 51 minus 49 is 2. So, 51 days later is the same as 7 weeks and 2 days later. Since 7 weeks is exactly a week, the weekday will be the same as the starting day, which is Friday. Then adding 2 days to Friday. Friday plus one day is Saturday, plus another day is Sunday. So, 51 days later should be a Sunday. Wait, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the division. Let me confirm: 7 times 7 is 49, 51 minus 49 is 2. Yes, that's correct.

So I need to figure out what day of the week March 14th falls on.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 14th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I'll assume it's a common year with 28 days. Then March 14th is 14 days into March.\n\nWait, but if January 1st is Sunday, then January 1st is day 0. So January 2nd is day 1, which is Monday. So to find the day of the week for March 14th, I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 14th, then find the remainder when divided by 7, because the days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n\nSo let's calculate the total days. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since we start counting from day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 14th is 14 days into March, so total days from January 1st to March 14th is 58 + 14 = 72 days. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is Sunday. So adding 72 days to that date would give me March 14th. But I need to find what day of the week that is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of days from January 1st to March 14th, then take that number modulo 7. Because each week has 7 days, so the remainder will tell me how many days ahead the date is from Sunday.\n\nSo let's recalculate. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 14th is 14 days. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 14 (Mar) = 72 days. Wait, but that's 72 days after January 1st. But if January 1st is Sunday, then adding 72 days would be the same as adding 72 mod 7 days. Let's compute 72 divided by 7. 7*10 is 70, so 72-70 is 2. So 72 mod 7 is 2. That means 72 days later is 2 days after Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 days is Tuesday. So March 14th would be a Tuesday?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me count again. January 1st is day 0 (Sunday). Then January 1st + 1 day is January 2nd (Monday). So if I want to find the day of the week for March 14th, I need to count how many days are between January 1st and March 14th, inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then the next day is day 1. So the number of days between January 1st and March 14th is 72 days. So adding 72 days to Sunday. But since each week is 7 days, 72 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. So March 14th would be a Tuesday. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1st as Sunday. Then January 8th is also Sunday (7 days later). January 15th is Sunday, January 22nd, January 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. So March 12th is a Sunday. Then March 13th is Monday, March 14th is Tuesday. So that's the same answer as before. So that seems to confirm that March 14th is a Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [99, "If a meeting is scheduled on the last Thursday of June 2022, on which day of the month does it occur? State the amount as a number.

I need to figure out which Thursday that is. First, I should check what day of the week June 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that June 1, 2022, was a Wednesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then June 1 is Wednesday, so June 2 would be Thursday. That would make June 2 a Thursday. But wait, the question is about the last Thursday. So I need to check how many Thursdays there are in June 2022.\n\nJune has 30 days. Let's list out the Thursdays. If June 2 is a Thursday, then adding 7 days each time: 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30. Wait, 2 + 7 is 9, then 16, 23, and 30. So that's five Thursdays. But June only has 30 days. So the last one would be June 30. But wait, if June 2 is a Thursday, then June 30 would be 28 days later. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so June 30 would be a Thursday as well. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, June 2 is Thursday. Then June 9 is Thursday, 16, 23, and 30. So yes, June 30 is a Thursday. But that would mean the last Thursday is the 30th. But I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day.\n\nWait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think. If June 1 is a Wednesday, then June 2 is Thursday. Then the next Thursday is June 9, then 16, 23, and 30. So that's five Thursdays. So the last one is June 30. But wait, June has 30 days, so June 30 is the last day of the month. So that would be the last Thursday. Therefore, the answer should be 30. But I need to make sure that June 30, 2022, was indeed a Thursday. Let me check with another method. For example, if I know that June 1, 2022, was a Wednesday, then adding 29 days to June 1 would get to June 30. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day. So June 1 is Wednesday, adding 29 days would be Wednesday + 1 day = Thursday. So June 30 is a Thursday. Therefore, the last Thursday in June 2022 is the 30th. So the answer should be 30. But wait, the question says to state the amount as a number. So the answer is 30. But I need to make sure that there isn't a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should check an actual calendar.

If the event recurs on that day, what's the day of the month? And if it doesn't exist, answer -1.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Because if I know that, I can count the days to find the last Thursday.\n\nWait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I should check a calendar or use some method to calculate it. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me think. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Saturday. Then February 1 is a Monday (since 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days, so adding 3 days to Saturday gives Tuesday? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again.\n\nWait, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, and so on. February 1, 2022, would be 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday (January 1) would be Tuesday. So February 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Then March 1 would be 28 days later (February 2022 is not a leap year, so 28 days). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Tuesday (March 1) would be Friday. So April 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Friday (April 1) would be Sunday. So May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. That matches what I thought earlier.\n\nSo May 1 is Sunday. Then the days of the week for May would be:\n\nMay 1: Sunday\n\nMay 2: Monday\n\nMay 3: Tuesday\n\nMay 4: Wednesday\n\nMay 5: Thursday\n\nSo the first Thursday is May 5. Then the next Thursdays would be May 12, 19, 26. Wait, May has 31 days. So the last Thursday would be May 26. Because May 26 is a Thursday, then May 27 is Friday, and so on. Let me check if May 26 is indeed a Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count from May 1. Since May 1 is Sunday, adding 4 days gets to Thursday. So May 5 is Thursday. Then adding 7 days each time. So 5 + 7 = 12, 19, 26. Then 26 +7 is 33, which is beyond May (which has 31 days). So the last Thursday is May 26. Therefore, the answer should be 26.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. Let me check the actual calendar for May 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use another method. Let's see. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 Tuesday, May 4 Wednesday, May 5 Thursday. Then May 6 Friday, May 7 Saturday, May 8 Sunday. So the next Thursday is May 12. Then May 19, then May 26.

Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2098 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2098. First, divide 2098 by 4. Let's do the division: 2098 divided by 4. 4 times 524 is 2096, so 2098 minus 2096 is 2. That leaves a remainder of 2, so 2098 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it doesn't meet the first condition. Even though it's not a century year, since it's not divisible by 4, it can't be a leap year.

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates. \n\nStarting on February 6, 2022, which is a Sunday. The end date is March 4, 2022, which is a Friday. \n\nLet me list out the dates from February 6 to March 4 and count the weekdays. But that might take too long. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and subtract the weekends.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days between February 6 and March 4, inclusive. \n\nFebruary 2022 has 28 days because 2022 is not a leap year. So from February 6 to February 28 is 28 - 6 = 22 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to add 1? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nIf I start on February 6 (day 1), then February 7 is day 2, and so on. So from February 6 to February 28 inclusive, that's 28 - 6 + 1 = 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total days would be 23 + 4 = 27 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, February 6 to February 28 is 23 days? Let me check. Let's count from February 6 to February 7: that's 2 days. So from February 6 to February 28 is 28 - 6 = 22 days, but adding 1 for inclusive, it's 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total is 23 + 4 = 27 days. So total days between Feb 6 and March 4 inclusive is 27 days.\n\nNow, how many weekends are in that period? Let's see. The start date is Sunday, February 6. So the first day is Sunday. Then the next day is Monday (Feb 7), then Tuesday (Feb 8), etc. So the weekends would be Sundays and Saturdays. \n\nLet me list the dates and check which are weekends. \n\nFebruary 6: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 7: Monday (weekday)\nFebruary 8: Tuesday (weekday)\nFebruary 9: Wednesday (weekday)\nFebruary 10: Thursday (weekday)\nFebruary 11: Friday (weekday)\nFebruary 12: Saturday (weekend)\nFebruary 13: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 14: Monday (weekday)\nFebruary 15: Tuesday (weekday)\nFebruary 16: Wednesday (weekday)\nFebruary 17: Thursday (weekday)\nFebruary 18: Friday (weekday)\nFebruary 19: Saturday (weekend)\nFebruary 20: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 21: Monday (weekday)\nFebruary 22: Tuesday (weekday)\nFebruary 23: Wednesday (weekday)\nFebruary 24: Thursday (weekday)\nFebruary 25: Friday (weekday)\nFebruary 26: Saturday (weekend)\nFebruary 27: Sunday (weekend)\nFebruary 28: Monday (weekday)\nMarch 1: Tuesday (weekday)\nMarch 2: Wednesday (weekday)\nMarch 3: Thursday (weekday)\nMarch 4: Friday (weekend)\n\nWait, March 4 is a Friday. Wait, the end date is March 4, which is a Friday. So the last day is Friday. So in the list above, March 4 is Friday, which is a weekday. So the weekends in this period are:\n\nFebruary 6 (Sunday), February 12 (Saturday), February 13 (Sunday), February 19 (Saturday), February 20 (Sunday), February 26 (Saturday), February 27 (Sunday).

So first, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates or find the first and last day of the week in that range. Let me start by checking what day of the week June 12, 2022 was. The problem says it's a Sunday. So June 12 is Sunday. Then June 13 is Monday. So the first Monday in the period is June 13, 2022.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many Mondays are there until July 28, 2022. Let me figure out the total number of days between June 12 and July 28, inclusive. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, June has 30 days. So from June 12 to June 30, that's 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to calculate the days from June 12 to June 30 inclusive. Wait, June 12 is day 1, then June 13 is day 2, etc. So the number of days from June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have two dates, the number of days between them inclusive is (end - start + 1). So June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total days from June 12 to July 28 inclusive is 19 + 28 = 47 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, June 12 to June 30 is 19 days (including both). Then July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total is 19 + 28 = 47 days. So the total number of days in the period is 47.\n\nNow, since June 12 is a Sunday, then June 13 is a Monday. So the first Monday is day 2 (June 13). Then each subsequent Monday is 7 days later. So the Mondays would be on June 13, 20, 27, July 4, 11, 18, 25. Wait, let's check that.\n\nJune 13 (Monday), then adding 7 days: June 20 (Monday), June 27 (Monday). Then July 4 (Monday), July 11, July 18, July 25. Then the next one would be August 1, which is outside the range. So that's 6 Mondays? Wait, let me count them:\n\n1. June 13\n2. June 20\n3. June 27\n4. July 4\n5. July 11\n6. July 18\n7. July 25\n\nWait, that's 7 Mondays. But wait, the total days are 47. Let me check if July 25 is within the period. The period ends on July 28, so July 25 is included. So that's 7 Mondays. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks and days. Since the total days are 47, which is 6 weeks and 5 days. So 6 weeks would have 6 Mondays, and then 5 days. But since the first day is Sunday, the first week would have 1 Monday (June 13), then each week adds another. Wait, but if there are 6 weeks, that's 42 days. Then 47 days is 6 weeks and 5 days. So the first day is Sunday, so the first 7 days (June 12-18) would be Sunday to Saturday. Then the next 7 days (June 19-25) would be Sunday to Saturday. Wait, but June 13 is Monday. So the first Monday is day 2. So in 47 days, how many Mondays?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of Mondays by finding the first Monday and then adding 7 days each time until the last day.\n\nSo June 13 is the first Monday. Then adding 7 days: June 20, 27. Then July 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 7 Mondays. Then July 25 is the 7th Monday. July 28 is the last day, which is Thursday. So that's correct. So the answer should be 7.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me list all the Mondays in that period:\n\nJune 13 (Monday)\nJune 20 (Monday)\nJune 27 (Monday)\nJuly 4 (Monday)\nJuly 11 (Monday)\nJuly 18 (Monday)\nJuly 25 (Monday)\n\nThat's 7 Mondays.

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me start by checking the dates. January 24, 2022 is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think January 24, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me check that. Well, if I remember correctly, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So adding 23 days to that would be January 24. Let me count: 23 days later. Since 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday plus 2 days is Monday. Yes, that's correct. So January 24 is a Monday.\n\nNow, the end date is March 22, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Let's see, March 22, 2022. If I know that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then March 22 would be 21 days later. 21 days is exactly 3 weeks, so March 22 would also be a Tuesday. Wait, but that might not be correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or some method to verify. But since I can't look it up, I'll have to rely on my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. Let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days from January 24 to March 22 inclusive. To do this, I need to calculate the number of days in each month between those dates.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 24 to January 31 is 31 - 24 = 7 days. But since we include both start and end dates, that's 7 days (from 24th to 31st inclusive). Wait, no. Wait, if I start on the 24th, then the next day is 25th, and so on. So from January 24 to January 31 is 8 days (including both ends). Wait, no. Wait, the number of days between two dates inclusive is (end date - start date + 1). So if I have January 24 to January 25, that's 2 days. So from January 24 to January 31 is 31 - 24 + 1 = 8 days. So that's 8 days in January.\n\nThen February 2022 has 28 days because 2022 is not a leap year. So February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. So total days would be 8 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 22 (Mar) = 58 days. Wait, but wait, that's from January 24 to March 22 inclusive? Let me check again.\n\nWait, January 24 to January 31 is 8 days (24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. So total is 8 + 28 + 22 = 58 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 58 days.\n\nNow, out of these 58 days, how many are weekends? Let's figure out how many Saturdays and Sundays there are in this period.\n\nSince the start date is a Monday (Jan 24), let's list the days of the week for each month.\n\nJanuary 24 is Monday. Then January 25 is Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So in January, the weekends are 29 (Saturday) and 30 (Sunday). That's 2 weekend days in January.\n\nThen February 2022 starts on a Tuesday (since January 31 is a Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday). Let me check that. January 31 is a Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, etc. So in February, the weekends are every Saturday and Sunday. Since February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks. So there are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. So 8 weekend days in February.\n\nThen March 1, 2022 is a Monday (since February 28 is a Monday, because February 28 is the last day of February, which is a Monday? Wait, let me check. If February 1 is a Tuesday, then February 28 is 27 days later. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. So March 1 is a Tuesday? Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, if February 1 is a Tuesday, then February 28 is 27 days later. Let's calculate the day of the week for February 28. 27 days is 3 weeks (21 days) and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Tuesday: Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. So February 28 is a Monday. Therefore, March 1 is a Tuesday. So March 1 is a Tuesday. Then March 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, etc. So in March, the weekends are 5 (Saturday) and 6 (Sunday). Then March 12 is Saturday, 13 Sunday, 19 Saturday, 20 Sunday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday. Wait, but our end date is March 22. So March 22 is a Tuesday. Let me check that. March 1 is Tuesday. March 22 is 21 days later. 21 days is 3 weeks, so March 22 is also a Tuesday. So March 22 is a Tuesday. So in March, the weekends are 5 (Saturday), 6 (Sunday), 12 (Saturday), 13 (Sunday), 19 (Saturday), 20 (Sunday), 26 (Saturday), 27 (Sunday). But since our end date is March 22, which is a Tuesday, we need to check how many weekends are in March up to March 22.\n\nSo March 5 is Saturday, 6 Sunday. Then March 12 is Saturday, 13 Sunday. Then March 19 is Saturday, 20 Sunday. Then March 26 is Saturday, 27 Sunday. But March 22 is before March 26. So in March, the weekends up to March 22 are 5,6,12,13,19,20. That's 6 weekend days. Wait, March 5 is Saturday, 6 Sunday. Then March 12 is Saturday, 13 Sunday. Then March 19 is Saturday, 20 Sunday. So that's 3 Saturdays and 3 Sundays, totaling 6 days. So in March, there are 6 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekend days in the entire period: January (2) + February (8) + March (6) = 16 weekend days.\n\nTherefore, total business days would be total days (58) minus weekend days (16) = 42 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me verify each month again.\n\nJanuary: 29 (Saturday) and 30 (Sunday) \u2192 2 days. Correct.\n\nFebruary: 28 days, 4 weeks. So 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. 8 days. Correct.\n\nMarch: From March 1 (Tuesday) to March 22 (Tuesday). Let's list the weekends in March:\n\nMarch 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun). That's 6 days. Correct. So 6 weekend days in March.\n\nTotal weekends: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16. So 58 total days minus 16 weekend days is 42 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check the total days again. January 24 to March 22 inclusive. Let me count the days again. January 24 to January 31 is 8 days. February has 28 days. March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. 8 + 28 + 22 = 58. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's calculate the number of weeks and days. From January 24 (Monday) to March 22 (Tuesday). Let's see how many weeks and days that is.\n\nFrom January 24 to March 22 is 58 days. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 2 days. So 8 weeks is 56 days, plus 2 days. So that's 8 weeks and 2 days. In 8 weeks, there are 8*5 = 40 business days. Then the remaining 2 days are Monday and Tuesday. So adding those 2 days, total business days would be 40 + 2 = 42. That matches the previous calculation. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 42.", "42"], [99, "Count forward 99 days from Monday, December 26, 2022 - what's the weekday? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 99 days after Monday, December 26, 2022. Hmm, first, I should figure out the date 99 days later. Then, determine the weekday.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than counting each day. Since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can divide 99 by 7 and find the remainder. That remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is from the original day.\n\nSo, 99 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 14 is 98, so 99 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 1 day. So the remainder is 1. That means 99 days later is 1 day after Monday. So Monday plus 1 day is Tuesday. Wait, but wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the original date is correct. December 26, 2022 is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Let me think. December 26, 2022. Let me check a calendar. Wait, I can't actually look it up, but I think that's correct. Let me assume that's correct for now.\n\nSo adding 99 days. Since 99 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 1 day. So adding 14 weeks brings us back to the same day, Monday. Then adding 1 day would be Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the date? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year. So February has 28 days. But since we're starting in December, maybe that's not an issue here. But maybe I should check the actual date 99 days after December 26, 2022 to make sure.\n\nLet me try to count the days step by step. December has 31 days. So December 26 is day 0. Then December 27 is +1, ..., December 31 is +5 days. Then January has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to January 31. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days would take us to March 28. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to April 28. Wait, but this might not be the right way. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the date 99 days after December 26, 2022. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom December 26 to December 31: 5 days (since 26th is day 0, 27th is +1, ..., 31st is +5). Then January has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to February 28 (since 31 days in January). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days would take us to March 28. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to April 28. Wait, but 5 + 31 + 28 + 31 = 95 days. Then 99 - 95 = 4 days. So adding 4 days to April 28 would be May 2. Wait, but that's 99 days? Let me check:\n\nWait, starting from December 26, 2022:\n\nDays remaining in December: 31 - 26 = 5 days (Dec 27 to Dec 31). Then January has 31 days, so 5 + 31 = 36 days. Then February has 28 days, so 36 + 28 = 64 days. Then March has 31 days, so 64 + 31 = 95 days. Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days would take us to May 2 (since 95 + 30 = 125, but that's more than 99). Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, 99 days after December 26. Let me count step by step:\n\nDec 26: day 0 (Monday)\nDec 27: +1 (Tuesday)\nDec 28: +2 (Wednesday)\nDec 29: +3 (Thursday)\nDec 30: +4 (Friday)\nDec 31: +5 (Saturday)\nJan 1: +6 (Sunday)\nJan 2: +7 (Monday)\nJan 3: +8 (Tuesday)\n...\nWait, maybe this is too tedious. Alternatively, since 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day, then adding 14 weeks (98 days) would bring us back to Monday, December 26 + 98 days. Then adding 1 more day would be Tuesday, December 27 + 98 days? Wait, no. Wait, the original date is December 26, 2022. Adding 98 days would be 14 weeks later, which is the same day, Monday. Then adding 1 more day would be Tuesday. So the answer is Tuesday. But I need to make sure that the 99 days is indeed 14 weeks and 1 day. 14*7=98, so 99 is 98+1. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the weekday should be Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let me try again. December 26 is day 0. Let's count the days:\n\nDecember has 31 days, so from Dec 26 to Dec 31 is 5 days (Dec 27 to Dec 31). Then January has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to Feb 28 (since 5 + 31 = 36 days). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days would take us to March 28 (36 + 28 = 64 days). Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to April 28 (64 + 31 = 95 days). Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days would take us to May 28 (95 + 30 = 125 days). Wait, but we need 99 days. So 95 days is April 28. Then 99 - 95 = 4 days. So April 28 + 4 days is May 2. Wait, but that's 99 days. So May 2, 2023. Now, what day of the week is May 2, 2023?\n\nBut wait, if December 26, 2022 is a Monday, then adding 99 days would be May 2, 2023. Let me check what day that is. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. So if December 26 is Monday, then 99 days later is Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday. But if the actual date is May 2, 2023, what day is that?\n\nWait, maybe I can check the actual date. Let me think. Let's check the day of the week for May 2, 2023. But since I can't look it up, I need to calculate it. Let's see. Let's take December 26, 2022 as Monday. Then December 26 + 98 days is Monday again. Then 99 days is Tuesday. So that's the answer. But maybe I should check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. December 26, 2022 is a Monday. Then December 27 is Tuesday, and so on. December 31 is Saturday. Then January 1, 2023 is Sunday. So that's correct. Then January 1 is Sunday. Then January 2 is Monday, etc. So if I can count from there.\n\nSo, from January 1, 2023 (Sunday), adding 99 days. Wait, but the original date is December 26, 2022. So 99 days after that is 99 days into 2023. Let me see. From December 26, 2022 to December 31, 2022 is 5 days. Then January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28 is 28 days. Then March 31 is 31 days. Then April 30 is 30 days. Then May 2 is 2 days. Wait, but that's adding up to 5 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 2 = 127 days. Wait, that's not right. Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that 99 days after December 26, 2022 is May 2, 2023. Let me check how many days from December 26, 2022 to May 2, 2023. December has 31 days, so from Dec 26 to Dec 31 is 5 days. Then January has 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, and May 2. So 5 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 2 = 5 + 31 is 36, plus 28 is 64, plus 31 is 95, plus 30 is 125, plus 2 is 127. Wait, that's way more than 99. So I must have made a mistake here. Wait, no. Wait, if I'm adding from December 26 to May 2, that's 99 days. Let me count again.\n\nWait, December 26 to December 31: 5 days (Dec 27-31). Then January has 31 days, so 5 + 31 = 36. Then February has 28 days, so 36 + 28 = 64. Then March has 31 days, so 64 + 31 = 95. Then April has 30 days, so 95 + 30 = 125. Then May 2 is 2 days into May. So that's 125 + 2 = 127 days. But that's way more than 99. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Wait, maybe I should not add all the days up to May 2, but instead, find the correct date that is 99 days after December 26.\n\nLet me try again. Starting from December 26, 2022:\n\nDec 26: 0 days\nDec 27: +1\nDec 28: +2\nDec 29: +3\nDec 30: +4\nDec 31: +5\nJan 1: +6\nJan 2: +7\nJan 3: +8\n...\nSo, each week is 7 days. Let's see, 99 days is 14 weeks (98 days) plus 1 day. So 98 days later is the same day, Monday, December 26 + 98 days. Then adding 1 day is Tuesday. So the answer is Tuesday. But if I can't trust that, maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So December 26, 2022 is 5 days before January 1, 2023. So December 26 is 5 days before Sunday. So December 26 is a Monday (since Sunday minus 5 days is Monday). Wait, that's correct. So January 1, 2023 is Sunday. Then, adding 99 days to December 26, 2022 (which is Monday) would be 99 days later. Let's count from January 1, 2023 (Sunday) to the date 99 days after December 26, 2022. Since December 26 is 5 days before January 1, 2023, then 99 days after December 26 is 99 days after 5 days before January 1. So that's 99 days after 5 days before January 1, which is 99 days after that date. So January 1 + 99 days is 99 days after January 1. Wait, but that's not helpful. Maybe I should think of it as 99 days from Monday, December 26.\n\nAlternatively, since January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then January 1 is day 0. Then January 2 is Monday, etc. So if I can find how many days from January 1, 2023 to the target date, then I can find the weekday.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me go back to the original method. Since 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day, then adding 14 weeks (98 days) brings us back to Monday, and then adding 1 day is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday. I think that's the correct approach. So the final answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [99, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Thursday, September 15 to Saturday, November 26, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Express your answer as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between Thursday, September 15 and Saturday, November 26, 2022, including both dates. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day.\n\nWait, maybe I can break it down into months. Let's start with September. September 15 is a Thursday. Let me check the days in September. September has 30 days. So from September 15 to September 30, that's 16 days (including both start and end). But I need to count only the weekdays in that period.\n\nWait, September 15 is Thursday. Let's list the days:\n\nSeptember 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri). So from 15 to 30, that's 16 days. Now, how many weekdays are there here?\n\nFrom 15 (Thu) to 30 (Fri). Let's count the weekdays:\n\nThu (15), Fri (16), Mon (19), Tue (20), Wed (21), Thu (22), Fri (23), Mon (26), Tue (27), Wed (28), Thu (29), Fri (30). Wait, that's 12 weekdays. Wait, let me check again. Let's list each day:\n\n15: Thu (weekday)\n16: Fri (weekday)\n17: Sat (weekend)\n18: Sun (weekend)\n19: Mon (weekday)\n20: Tue (weekday)\n21: Wed (weekday)\n22: Thu (weekday)\n23: Fri (weekday)\n24: Sat (weekend)\n25: Sun (weekend)\n26: Mon (weekday)\n27: Tue (weekday)\n28: Wed (weekday)\n29: Thu (weekday)\n30: Fri (weekday)\n\nSo from 15 to 30, that's 16 days. The weekends are 17,18,24,25. So 4 weekends. So weekdays are 16 - 4 = 12. So September contributes 12 weekdays.\n\nNow moving to October. October has 31 days. Let's check the days from October 1 to October 31. But I need to check which days are weekdays. Wait, but the end date is November 26. So October is fully included? Wait, the start is September 15, and the end is November 26. So October is entirely between those dates. So I need to count all weekdays in October.\n\nBut wait, what's the first day of October 2022? Let me check. September 15 is a Thursday. September 16 is Friday. September 17 is Saturday. September 18 is Sunday. September 19 is Monday. So October 1, 2022 is a Sunday? Wait, September has 30 days. So September 30 is a Friday. Then October 1 is a Saturday. Wait, wait, let me check again. Wait, September 15 is Thursday. Let me count the days from September 15 to September 30.\n\nSeptember 15: Thu\n16: Fri\n17: Sat\n18: Sun\n19: Mon\n20: Tue\n21: Wed\n22: Thu\n23: Fri\n24: Sat\n25: Sun\n26: Mon\n27: Tue\n28: Wed\n29: Thu\n30: Fri\n\nSo October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday. So October has 31 days. Let's count the weekdays in October. So from October 1 (Sat) to October 31 (Mon? Let me check. October 31 is a Monday? Wait, October 1 is Saturday. Let's count the days. October has 31 days. So October 1 is Saturday, October 2 is Sunday, October 3 is Monday. So October 3 is Monday. Then October 4 is Tuesday, and so on. Let me check the last day of October. October 31: since October 1 is Saturday, adding 30 days (since 31-1=30). 30 days later is October 31. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So October 1 (Saturday) + 30 days is Saturday + 2 days = Monday. So October 31 is a Monday. So October has 31 days, starting on Saturday and ending on Monday.\n\nNow, to count the weekdays in October. Weekdays are Monday to Friday. So in October, how many Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays are there?\n\nSince October starts on Saturday, the first weekday is Monday, October 3. Then the next days. Let's count the number of each weekday.\n\nIn a 31-day month starting on Saturday:\n\nNumber of weeks is 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. So 4 weeks and 3 days. So each weekday will occur 4 times, plus the first three days of the month (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) will have one extra day.\n\nWait, the first day is Saturday. So the first week has Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Then the next weeks are Tuesday to Friday, then Saturday again, etc. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of each weekday.\n\nAlternatively, since October has 31 days, and starts on Saturday, the number of each weekday can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal days: 31.\n\nNumber of Saturdays: 5 (since 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. The first day is Saturday, so the first 4 weeks have 4 Saturdays, and the remaining 3 days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) include one more Saturday. So total 5 Saturdays.\n\nSimilarly, Sundays: 5 (same logic: first 4 weeks have 4 Sundays, then the remaining 3 days include Sunday again. So 5 Sundays.\n\nMondays: 5 (since the first day is Saturday, the first Monday is the third day. Then in the 4 weeks, there are 4 Mondays, and the remaining 3 days include one more Monday. So 5 Mondays.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. If the month starts on Saturday, then the first week is Saturday (1), Sunday (2), Monday (3). Then the next week is Tuesday (4), Wednesday (5), Thursday (6), Friday (7). Then the next week is Saturday (8), Sunday (9), Monday (10). Then the next week is Tuesday (11), Wednesday (12), Thursday (13), Friday (14). Then the next week is Saturday (15), Sunday (16), Monday (17). Then the next week is Tuesday (18), Wednesday (19), Thursday (20), Friday (21). Then the next week is Saturday (22), Sunday (23), Monday (24). Then the next week is Tuesday (25), Wednesday (26), Thursday (27), Friday (28). Then the next week is Saturday (29), Sunday (30), Monday (31). So October 31 is Monday. So the Mondays are on days 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. That's 5 Mondays. Similarly, Tuesdays are on 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 4 Tuesdays. Wait, but 31 days. Wait, let me count again.\n\nWait, the first Tuesday is day 4 (October 4). Then each week after that. So 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 4 Tuesdays. Then the next Tuesday would be day 32, which is beyond 31. So only 4 Tuesdays. Similarly, Wednesdays: 5, 12, 19, 26. That's 4 Wednesdays. Thursdays: 6, 13, 20, 27. 4 Thursdays. Fridays: 7, 14, 21, 28. 4 Fridays. Saturdays: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. 5 Saturdays. Sundays: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. 5 Sundays. Mondays: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. 5 Mondays. So total days: 5+5+4+4+4+5+5= 32? Wait, that can't be. Wait, the total days in October are 31. So there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the days are:\n\nSaturdays: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (5 days)\nSundays: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5 days)\nMondays: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 (5 days)\nTuesdays: 4, 11, 18, 25 (4 days)\nWednesdays: 5, 12, 19, 26 (4 days)\nThursdays: 6, 13, 20, 27 (4 days)\nFridays: 7, 14, 21, 28 (4 days)\nTotal: 5+5+5+4+4+4+4 = 31 days. Yes, that adds up. So the weekdays are Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays. So that's 5+4+4+4+4 = 21 weekdays in October. Wait, 5 Mondays, 4 Tuesdays, 4 Wednesdays, 4 Thursdays, 4 Fridays. 5+4+4+4+4 = 21. So October has 21 weekdays.\n\nNow moving to November. The end date is November 26. So November 1 is a Tuesday (since October 31 is Monday, so November 1 is Tuesday). Let me check that. October 31 is Monday, so November 1 is Tuesday. So November starts on Tuesday. Now, November has 30 days. The end date is November 26. So I need to count the weekdays from November 1 to November 26.\n\nSo November 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the weekdays in November up to the 26th. Let's list the days:\n\nNovember 1: Tuesday\n2: Wednesday\n3: Thursday\n4: Friday\n5: Saturday\n6: Sunday\n7: Monday\n8: Tuesday\n9: Wednesday\n10: Thursday\n11: Friday\n12: Saturday\n13: Sunday\n14: Monday\n15: Tuesday\n16: Wednesday\n17: Thursday\n18: Friday\n19: Saturday\n20: Sunday\n21: Monday\n22: Tuesday\n23: Wednesday\n24: Thursday\n25: Friday\n26: Saturday\n\nWait, November 26 is Saturday. So the days from November 1 to November 26 are 26 days. Now, let's count the weekdays (Monday-Friday) in this period.\n\nLet me list each day:\n\n1: Tue (weekday)\n2: Wed (weekday)\n3: Thu (weekday)\n4: Fri (weekday)\n5: Sat (weekend)\n6: Sun (weekend)\n7: Mon (weekday)\n8: Tue (weekday)\n9: Wed (weekday)\n10: Thu (weekday)\n11: Fri (weekday)\n12: Sat (weekend)\n13: Sun (weekend)\n14: Mon (weekday)\n15: Tue (weekday)\n16: Wed (weekday)\n17: Thu (weekday)\n18: Fri (weekday)\n19: Sat (weekend)\n20: Sun (weekend)\n21: Mon (weekday)\n22: Tue (weekday)\n23: Wed (weekday)\n24: Thu (weekday)\n25: Fri (weekday)\n26: Sat (weekend)\n\nNow, count the weekdays. Let's go through each day:\n\n1-4: 4 weekdays (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n5-6: 0\n7-11: 5 weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n12-13: 0\n14-18: 5 weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n19-20: 0\n21-25: 5 weekdays (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n26: 0\n\nTotal: 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19 weekdays in November from 1 to 26.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me count again. From 1 to 4: 4 weekdays. Then 7-11 is 5 (days 7-11: 5 days). Then 14-18 is 5 (days 14-18: 5 days). Then 21-25 is 5 (days 21-25: 5 days). So 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19. Yes. So November contributes 19 weekdays.\n\nSo total weekdays from September 15 to November 26 is September's 12 + October's 21 + November's 19 = 12 + 21 is 33, plus 19 is 52. Wait, 12+21=33, 33+19=52. So the answer is 52?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the days. Let me verify each part again.\n\nSeptember: 12 weekdays. October: 21. November: 19. Total 52. But let me check another way. Let's calculate the total number of days between September 15 and November 26, inclusive, then subtract the weekends.\n\nFirst, calculate the total days. September 15 to September 30: 16 days. October has 31 days. November 1 to November 26: 26 days. Total days: 16 + 31 + 26 = 73 days. Wait, but that's 16 (Sep 15-30) + 31 (Oct) + 26 (Nov 1-26) = 73 days. But wait, September 15 to September 30 is 16 days (inclusive). Then October is 31 days. Then November 1 to 26 is 26 days. So total 16 + 31 + 26 = 73 days. Now, the total number of weekends in this period. Let's calculate that.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to check if the total days is 73, and then subtract the number of weekends. But how many weekends are there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the total number of weekdays by adding the three months' weekdays. But I need to make sure that my previous counts are correct.\n\nSeptember: 12 weekdays. October: 21. November: 19. Total 52. So 52 weekdays. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the total days (73) and subtract the number of weekends. So if I can find the number of weekends in the period, then 73 - weekends = weekdays.\n\nSo how many weekends are there?\n\nFirst, let's check the weekends in September. From September 15 to September 30. The weekends are Saturday and Sunday. In September, the weekends are:\n\nSeptember 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun). That's 4 weekends. So 4 days.\n\nIn October, the weekends are Saturdays and Sundays. October has 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. So 10 days.\n\nIn November, from November 1 to November 26, the weekends are Saturday and Sunday. Let's check:\n\nNovember 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat). Wait, November 26 is Saturday. So the weekends in November are 5,6,12,13,19,20,26. That's 7 days. Wait, but November 26 is included in the period. So that's 7 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekends: 4 (Sep) + 10 (Oct) + 7 (Nov) = 21 days. So total weekdays would be 73 - 21 = 52. Which matches the previous count. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 52.", "52"], [99, "Is 2055 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2055 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2055. First, divide 2055 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2055 minus 2000 is 55. 55 divided by 4 is 13.75. So 2055 divided by 4 is 513.75. That means 2055 is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check again. Let me add 4 to 2055: 2055 + 4 is 2059. So 2055 is not a multiple of 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, since it's not divisible by 4, it can't be a leap year. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm. 2055 divided by 4: 4 times 500 is 2000, 4 times 513 is 2052. 2052 plus 4 is 2056. So 2055 is between 2052 and 2056. So yes, 2055 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it's not a leap year. Also, since it's not a century year (it's not divisible by 100), the second condition about 400 doesn't come into play here. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [99, "Count forward 46 days from Wednesday, February 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 46 days after Wednesday, February 2, 2022. Hmm, so first, I should figure out the date 46 days later, and then determine the weekday.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to calculate the weekday without knowing the exact date? Because adding days can be done by considering how many weeks and extra days there are. Since a week has 7 days, 46 divided by 7 gives 6 weeks and 4 days. So if I start on a Wednesday, adding 6 weeks would still be Wednesday, and then adding 4 more days would take me to Sunday. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, let me check. Let's break it down. 46 divided by 7 is 6 with a remainder of 4. So 6 weeks is 42 days, and then 4 more days. So starting from Wednesday, adding 4 days: Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this by actually counting the days. Let me try that. Let's start from February 2, 2022, which is a Wednesday. Let's count 46 days forward.\n\nFirst, February 2022: February has 28 days in 2022 because it's not a leap year. So from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since 28 - 2 = 26). Wait, no, if I start on February 2, then adding 26 days would take me to February 28. But that's 26 days. Then, March has 31 days, April has 30, May 31, etc. But maybe I should just count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try again.\n\nIf 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days, then the weekday should be 4 days after Wednesday. So Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. But maybe I should check if the number of days is correct. Let me count the days in each month.\n\nStarting from February 2, 2022. Let's count the days:\n\nFebruary 2 to February 28: 28 - 2 = 26 days. So that's 26 days. Then March has 31 days, April 30, May 31, etc. But if I need 46 days, then 26 days in February plus 20 days in March would be 46 days. Wait, 26 + 20 = 46. So that would be March 20th, 2022. Wait, but is that correct?\n\nWait, February 2 is day 0. Then adding 26 days would be February 28. Then adding 20 days would be March 20. So March 20, 2022. Now, what day of the week is March 20, 2022?\n\nBut I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. If February 2 is Wednesday, then February 28 is 26 days later. 26 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 5 days. So Wednesday + 5 days is Monday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if I add 26 days, which is 3 weeks and 5 days, then the weekday would be Wednesday + 5 days. Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 Friday, +3 Saturday, +4 Sunday, +5 Monday. So February 28, 2022, is a Monday. Then adding 20 days to that would be March 20. Let's check how many days that is. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. So March 20, 2022, is a Sunday. Therefore, 46 days after February 2 is Sunday. So that matches my initial calculation. So the answer should be Sunday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. If 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days, then adding 4 days to Wednesday would be Sunday. So that's consistent. So both methods give the same answer. Therefore, the answer is Sunday.", "Sunday"], [99, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, December 4, 2022, to Saturday, January 14, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates. Wait, the start date is Sunday, December 4, 2022, and the end date is Saturday, January 14, 2022. Wait, but January 14 is after December 4, so the period is from December 4 to January 14. But I need to make sure that the dates are correct. Let me confirm the actual dates.\n\nWait, December 4, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me check that. Let me think: December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. So December 2 was Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday. Yes, that's correct. So the start date is Sunday, December 4.\n\nNow, the end date is Saturday, January 14, 2022. Wait, but January 14, 2022 is after December 4. Wait, but wait, the question says from Sunday, December 4 to Saturday, January 14. But wait, December 4 is in 2022, and January 14 is also in 2022. So the period is from December 4 to January 14, inclusive. But I need to check if that's correct. Wait, the user wrote \"from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)\". So that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total number of days between these two dates, then subtract the weekends. But since the dates span two months (December and January), I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of days from December 4, 2022, to December 31, 2022, inclusive. Then add the days from January 1, 2022, to January 14, 2022, inclusive. Then subtract the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in both periods.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the number of weekends. But since the dates are inclusive, I need to make sure that both start and end dates are counted.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates, then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut first, let's find the total number of days between December 4, 2022, and January 14, 2022, inclusive.\n\nFirst, December has 31 days. So from December 4 to December 31 is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days. Wait, because inclusive. So December 4 is day 1, December 5 is day 2, ..., December 31 is day 28. Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total days would be 28 + 14 = 42 days. But wait, that's if the period is from December 4 to January 14 inclusive. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, December 4 to December 31: 31 - 4 = 27 days, but since it's inclusive, it's 27 + 1 = 28 days. Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total is 28 + 14 = 42 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 42 days.\n\nNow, from these 42 days, I need to subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays). So how many weekends are there in this period?\n\nFirst, let's figure out the days of the week for the dates. The start date is Sunday, December 4. So December 4 is Sunday. Then December 5 is Monday, December 6 is Tuesday, December 7 is Wednesday, December 8 is Thursday, December 9 is Friday, December 10 is Saturday, December 11 is Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo the first week (Dec 4-10) includes Sunday (Dec 4), Monday (5), Tuesday (6), Wednesday (7), Thursday (8), Friday (9), Saturday (10). Then the next week starts on Sunday, Dec 11.\n\nSo in December, the weekends would be:\n\n- Dec 4 (Sunday) is included, but wait, Dec 4 is the start date. Wait, the first weekend in December would be Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 (Monday)? Wait no, Dec 4 is Sunday, Dec 5 is Monday. So the first weekend is Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 10 (Saturday). Wait, no. Wait, the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. So in the first week, Dec 4 is Sunday, Dec 5 is Monday, Dec 6 is Tuesday, Dec 7 is Wednesday, Dec 8 is Thursday, Dec 9 is Friday, Dec 10 is Saturday. So the weekend days in that week are Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 10 (Saturday). Then the next week starts on Dec 11 (Sunday), and the weekend days would be Dec 11 (Sunday) and Dec 17 (Saturday), and so on.\n\nSo in December, the weekends would be:\n\n- Dec 4 (Sunday)\n- Dec 10 (Saturday)\n- Dec 11 (Sunday)\n- Dec 17 (Saturday)\n- Dec 24 (Saturday)\n- Dec 31 (Saturday)\nWait, wait, let me check that again. Let's list all the weekends in December 2022.\n\nStarting from Dec 4 (Sunday), the weekends are:\n\n- Dec 4 (Sunday)\n- Dec 5 (Monday) is not a weekend. Wait, no. Wait, weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So the first weekend in December would be Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 (Monday)? No, that's not right. Wait, Dec 4 is Sunday, Dec 5 is Monday. The next Saturday is Dec 10. So the first weekend (Sunday and Saturday) would be Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 10 (Saturday). Then the next weekend is Dec 11 (Sunday) and Dec 17 (Saturday), then Dec 22 (Sunday) and Dec 28 (Saturday), then Dec 31 (Saturday) and Jan 1 (Sunday). Wait, but Jan 1 is in the next month.\n\nWait, but the period ends on January 14. So in December, the weekends would be:\n\n- Dec 4 (Sunday)\n- Dec 10 (Saturday)\n- Dec 11 (Sunday)\n- Dec 17 (Saturday)\n- Dec 22 (Sunday)\n- Dec 28 (Saturday)\n- Dec 31 (Saturday) \u2013 wait, Dec 31 is a Saturday? Let me check. Let's count the days.\n\nDec 4 is Sunday. Dec 5 is Monday, Dec 6 Tuesday, Dec 7 Wednesday, Dec 8 Thursday, Dec 9 Friday, Dec 10 Saturday. Then Dec 11 is Sunday. Then Dec 12 is Monday, Dec 13 Tuesday, Dec 14 Wednesday, Dec 15 Thursday, Dec 16 Friday, Dec 17 Saturday.

Dec 25 Sunday, Dec 26 Monday, Dec 27 Tuesday, Dec 28 Wednesday, Dec 29 Thursday, Dec 30 Friday, Dec 31 Saturday. Wait, so Dec 31 is a Saturday.

Wait, no. Wait, Dec 24 is Saturday. Then Dec 25 is Sunday, Dec 26 is Monday, Dec 27 is Tuesday, Dec 28 is Wednesday. So Dec 28 is Wednesday. So that's not a weekend. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount.\n\nWait, Dec 4 is Sunday. Then:\n\nWeek 1: Dec 4 (Sun), Dec 5 (Mon), Dec 6 (Tue), Dec 7 (Wed), Dec 8 (Thu), Dec 9 (Fri), Dec 10 (Sat)\n\nWeek 2: Dec 11 (Sun), Dec 12 (Mon), Dec 13 (Tue), Dec 14 (Wed), Dec 15 (Thu), Dec 16 (Fri), Dec 17 (Sat)\n\nWeek 3: Dec 18 (Sun), Dec 19 (Mon), Dec 20 (Tue), Dec 21 (Wed), Dec 22 (Thu), Dec 23 (Fri), Dec 24 (Sat)\n\nWeek 4: Dec 25 (Sun), Dec 26 (Mon), Dec 27 (Tue), Dec 28 (Wed), Dec 29 (Thu), Dec 30 (Fri), Dec 31 (Sat)\n\nSo the weekends in December are:\n\n- Dec 4 (Sun)\n- Dec 10 (Sat)\n- Dec 11 (Sun)\n- Dec 17 (Sat)\n- Dec 22 (Thu)? No, wait, Dec 22 is Thursday. Wait, in week 3, Dec 24 is Saturday. So the weekends in week 3 are Dec 24 (Sat) and Dec 25 (Sun). Then week 4: Dec 25 (Sun), Dec 26 (Mon), Dec 27 (Tue), Dec 28 (Wed), Dec 29 (Thu), Dec 30 (Fri), Dec 31 (Sat). So the weekends in week 4 are Dec 25 (Sun) and Dec 31 (Sat).\n\nSo in total, the weekends in December are:\n\n- Dec 4 (Sun)\n- Dec 10 (Sat)\n- Dec 11 (Sun)\n- Dec 17 (Sat)\n- Dec 24 (Sat)\n- Dec 25 (Sun)\n- Dec 31 (Sat)\n\nWait, that's 7 weekends. Let me count again:\n\nWeek 1: Dec 4 (Sun) and Dec 10 (Sat) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 2: Dec 11 (Sun) and Dec 17 (Sat) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 3: Dec 24 (Sat) and Dec 25 (Sun) \u2192 2 days.\n\nWeek 4: Dec 31 (Sat) and Dec 25 (Sun) is already counted. Wait, no. Wait, week 4 starts on Dec 25 (Sun), so the weekend days are Dec 25 (Sun) and Dec 31 (Sat). So that's two more days. So total of 2+2+2+2=8? Wait, but Dec 25 is in week 4, and Dec 31 is also in week 4. So that's two more days. So total of 2 (week 1) + 2 (week 2) + 2 (week 3) + 2 (week 4) = 8 days. But wait, Dec 25 is Sunday, Dec 26 is Monday, Dec 27 is Tuesday, Dec 28 is Wednesday, Dec 29 is Thursday, Dec 30 is Friday, Dec 31 is Saturday. So the weekend days in week 4 are Dec 25 (Sun) and Dec 31 (Sat). So that's two days. So total of 8 weekend days in December.\n\nWait, but Dec 25 is Sunday, which is included in the period. So that's correct. So in December, there are 8 weekend days.\n\nNow, moving on to January. The period includes January 1 to January 14. Let's check the days of the week for those dates.\n\nFirst, December 31 is Saturday. So January 1 is Sunday. Then January 2 is Monday, January 3 is Tuesday, January 4 is Wednesday, January 5 is Thursday, January 6 is Friday, January 7 is Saturday, January 8 is Sunday, January 9 is Monday, January 10 is Tuesday, January 11 is Wednesday, January 12 is Thursday, January 13 is Friday, January 14 is Saturday.\n\nSo the weekends in January are:\n\n- Jan 1 (Sunday)\n- Jan 7 (Saturday)\n- Jan 8 (Sunday)\n- Jan 14 (Saturday)\n\nSo that's 4 weekend days in January.\n\nSo total weekend days in the entire period (Dec 4 to Jan 14) are 8 (December) + 4 (January) = 12 days.\n\nBut wait, the total number of days is 42. So business days would be 42 - 12 = 30 days. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the total days from Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive is 42 days. If there are 12 weekend days, then 42 - 12 = 30 business days. But let me verify this with another approach to make sure.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's count the business days in each month.\n\nDecember: From Dec 4 to Dec 31. Let's count the business days.\n\nDec 4 is Sunday. So the first business day is Dec 5 (Monday). The last business day in December is Dec 31 (Saturday). Wait, but Dec 31 is a Saturday, which is a weekend. So the last business day in December would be Dec 30 (Friday). Wait, but the period includes Dec 31. So need to check if Dec 31 is included in the count.\n\nWait, the total period is from Dec 4 (Sunday) to Jan 14 (Saturday). So Dec 31 is included. So in December, the business days are from Dec 5 (Monday) to Dec 30 (Friday), and then Dec 31 is Saturday (non-business). So how many business days in December?\n\nFrom Dec 5 to Dec 30 inclusive. Let's calculate that. Dec 5 is day 1, Dec 30 is day 26. So 26 days. But wait, that's not correct. Wait, Dec 5 to Dec 30 is 30 - 5 + 1 = 26 days. But how many of those are business days?\n\nBut since Dec 5 is Monday, Dec 6 is Tuesday, ..., Dec 10 is Saturday, Dec 11 is Sunday. So in the first week (Dec 5-11), the business days are Monday to Friday (5 days). Then Dec 12-17: 5 business days. Dec 18-23: 5 days. Dec 24-29: 5 days. Dec 30 is Friday. So that's 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 days. Wait, but Dec 5 to Dec 30 is 26 days. Wait, but if each week has 5 business days, then 5 weeks would be 25 days. But Dec 5 to Dec 30 is 26 days. So maybe there's an extra day. Let me check.\n\nWait, Dec 5 is Monday. Dec 12 is Monday. Dec 19 is Monday. Dec 26 is Monday. Dec 30 is Friday. So from Dec 5 to Dec 30 is 26 days. Let's break it down:\n\nWeek 1: Dec 5 (Mon) to Dec 11 (Sun) \u2192 7 days. Business days: 5 (Mon-Fri).\n\nWeek 2: Dec 12 (Mon) to Dec 18 (Sun) \u2192 7 days. Business days: 5.\n\nWeek 3: Dec 19 (Mon) to Dec 25 (Sun) \u2192 7 days. Business days: 5.\n\nWeek 4: Dec 26 (Mon) to Dec 31 (Sat) \u2192 6 days. Business days: 5 (Mon-Fri). Dec 31 is Saturday, which is not a business day.\n\nSo total business days in December: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20 days. But wait, Dec 31 is included in the period, but it's a Saturday, so not counted. So that's correct. So 20 business days in December.\n\nThen in January, from Jan 1 to Jan 14. Jan 1 is Sunday, Jan 2 is Monday, ..., Jan 7 is Saturday, Jan 8 is Sunday, Jan 14 is Saturday.\n\nSo the business days in January are from Jan 2 (Monday) to Jan 7 (Saturday) \u2192 but wait, Jan 7 is Saturday, which is a weekend. So the business days would be from Jan 2 (Mon) to Jan 6 (Fri), and then Jan 8 (Sun) is a weekend, but Jan 14 is Saturday. Wait, the period includes Jan 1 to Jan 14. So the business days in January are:\n\nJan 2 (Mon) to Jan 6 (Fri) \u2192 5 days.\n\nThen Jan 8 (Sun) is a weekend, so not counted. Jan 9 (Mon) to Jan 14 (Sat) \u2192 but Jan 14 is Saturday. So business days are Jan 9 (Mon) to Jan 13 (Fri) \u2192 5 days.\n\nSo total business days in January: 5 + 5 = 10 days.\n\nSo total business days from Dec 4 to Jan 14"], [99, "On which weekday did June 26, 2022 fall?

If I can find a known date in 2022, maybe I can count the days. For example, if I know that June 26 is a certain day, but I need to find it. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's see. Let's take a known date. For example, I remember that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 25 days would get me to June 26. Let me check. June has 30 days, so June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 8 is Wednesday, June 15 is Wednesday, June 22 is Wednesday, and June 29 is Wednesday. Then June 26 would be 3 days before June 29, which would be Sunday. So that would mean June 26, 2022 was a Sunday. \n\nBut wait, I need to confirm if June 1, 2022 was indeed a Wednesday. How can I check that?

Therefore, my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday might be wrong. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me think. If March 14, 2022 was a Monday, then March 15 would be Tuesday. Then March 21 is Monday again. Then April 4 is Monday. Then April 11, 18, 25. May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. June 6, 13, 20, 27. July 4 would be a Monday. Wait, that would mean that June 27 is a Monday. Then June 29 would be Wednesday. So that would align with the previous conclusion. But how do I know that March 14, 2022 was a Monday?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then March 28, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, if I can find a known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me confirm that. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then March 28, 2022 was a Monday. Then March 21, 14, 7 would be Mondays. Then March 7, 2022 was a Monday. Then February 28, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, but that would mean that February 28, 2022 was a Monday. Then February 28 is the 28th day of February. Since 2022 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. So March 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. Then March 7 would be a Monday. That seems correct. Then March 14 would be a Monday. So March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Then March 14 is a Monday. Then March 21 is Monday, March 28 is Monday. April 4 is Monday. April 11, 18, 25. Then May 2 is Monday. May 9, 16, 23, 30. June 6, 13, 20, 27. July 4 is Monday. So that would mean that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Therefore, July 1 would be a Friday (since July 4 is Monday, subtract 3 days). So July 1 is Friday. Then June 30 is Thursday. June 29 is Wednesday. Therefore, June 29, 2022 was a Wednesday. \n\nAlternatively, if I can check another date. For example, June 29, 2022. Let me think about the day of the week for June 29, 2022. If I know that July 4 is Monday, then June 29 is 5 days before July 4. So July 4 minus 5 days is June 29. So July 4 is Monday, subtract 5 days: Monday minus 1 day is Sunday, minus 2 is Saturday, minus 3 is Friday, minus 4 is Thursday, minus 5 is Wednesday. So June 29 is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be Wednesday. \n\nBut to make sure, let me check another way. If I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 8 is Wednesday, 15, 22, 29. So June 29 would be a Wednesday. That would align with the previous conclusion. But how do I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday? Well, if July 1 is Friday, then June 30 is Thursday, June 29 is Wednesday. So June 1 would be 28 days before June 29. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so June 1 would be the same day as June 29. So if June 29 is Wednesday, then June 1 is also Wednesday. That makes sense. Therefore, the answer is Wednesday.", "Wednesday"], [99, "What day of the week was May 31, 2022? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week May 31, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not entirely sure how that works. Alternatively, I could remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, let me check that. If I remember correctly, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. \n\nAlternatively, I can use a known date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think. If I can find a reference point, like a known date in 2022. For instance, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. July 4, 2022: if I count backwards, June has 30 days. So June 30, 2022 would be a Sunday. Then July 1 is a Monday. So July 4 is a Thursday? Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Alternatively, maybe I should use an online calendar or a perpetual calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year. So February had 28 days. Let's try to count from a known date. Let's say I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then May 1 is Sunday, so May 2 is Monday, and so on. Then May 31 would be 30 days later. Wait, May has 31 days, so May 1 is day 1. So May 31 is 30 days after May 1. Since 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if May 1 is Sunday, then adding 2 days would make May 31 a Tuesday? Wait, that would mean May 31 is Tuesday. But I need to confirm if May 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, April 1, 2022. If I can figure out that date, then I can count forward. Let's see. April 1, 2022. If I remember that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, March 1, 2022: if March 1 is Tuesday, then March 8 is Tuesday, March 15, 22, 29. Then April 5 would be Tuesday. So April 5 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is 4 days before that, which would be Friday. Wait, April 1, 2022 was a Friday? Then April 1 is Friday. Then April 8 is Friday, and so on. Then May 1 is 31 days after April 1. Wait, April has 30 days, so May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if April 1 is Friday, then May 1 would be Friday + 2 days = Sunday. So that would mean May 1 is Sunday. Then May 31 is 30 days later, which is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Therefore, May 31, 2022 would be a Tuesday. \n\nBut I need to make sure that my assumption about April 1 being Friday is correct. Let me check again. If March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then March 8, 15, 22, 29 are Tuesdays. Then April 5 is a Tuesday. So April 5 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is 4 days before that. April 1 is Friday. So that seems correct. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Friday + 2 days is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 31 is 30 days later, which is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Therefore, May 31, 2022 was a Tuesday. \n\nAlternatively, I can check another way. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's count from May 31 to July 4. May has 31 days, so May 31 is the day in question. Then June has 30 days, so from May 31 to June 30 is 30 days. Then July 1 to July 4 is 4 days. So total days from May 31 to July 4 is 30 + 4 = 34 days. 34 days is 4 weeks and 6 days. So if July 4 is Monday, then May 31 would be 6 days before Monday. Let's count backwards: Monday minus 6 days. Monday minus 1 day is Sunday, minus 2 is Saturday, minus 3 is Friday, minus 4 is Thursday, minus 5 is Wednesday, minus 6 is Tuesday. So that would mean May 31 is Tuesday. That matches the previous conclusion. \n\nTherefore, both methods lead me to the conclusion that May 31, 2022 was a Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [99, "Count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022 - what's the weekday? Reply with just the weekday name.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022, and find out what day of the week that falls on. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can divide 81 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 81 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 4 days because 11 times 7 is 77, and 81 minus 77 is 4. So, going back 81 days is the same as going back 11 weeks and 4 days. Since 11 weeks is exactly 77 days, which brings me back to the same day of the week, the remaining 4 days will determine the weekday.\n\nNow, starting from Tuesday, October 4, 2022. If I go back 4 days, what day would that be? Let's count. One day before Tuesday is Monday, two days is Sunday, three days is Saturday, and four days is Friday. Wait, so going back 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday? But wait, that seems off. Wait, maybe I should check again. Let me count backwards step by step.\n\nStarting from Tuesday, October 4, 2022:\n\n- 1 day before: Monday, October 3, 2022\n- 2 days before: Sunday, October 2, 2022\n- 3 days before: Saturday, September 30, 2022\n- 4 days before: Friday, September 29, 2022\n\nSo, going back 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday. Therefore, the weekday should be Friday. But wait, I need to make sure that the calculation is correct. Because 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days, so subtracting 4 days from Tuesday would indeed give the correct day. But maybe I should verify with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a calendar or check the actual dates. Let me try to count backward step by step for a few days to confirm. Let's see, October 4 is Tuesday. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 4 days is September 30 (Saturday), September 29 (Friday), September 28 (Thursday), September 27 (Wednesday), September 26 (Tuesday). Wait, that's 5 days back. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try again.\n\nWait, if I go back 1 day from October 4 is October 3 (Monday). Then 2 days back is October 2 (Sunday). 3 days back is September 30 (Saturday). 4 days back is September 29 (Friday). So that's correct. So 4 days back is Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But I need to make sure that the total days are correct. Let me check the total days again. 81 days is 11 weeks (77 days) plus 4 days. So subtracting 77 days would bring me back to the same day, Tuesday, and then subtracting 4 more days would be Friday. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's check what day of the week October 4, 2022, was. Wait, the user said it's Tuesday. So if I go back 81 days, I can check the date. Let me try to find the date 81 days before October 4, 2022. Let's count backward. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 81 days. Let's subtract months and days. 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. So subtracting 11 weeks (77 days) from October 4 would be September 27, 2022. Then subtract 4 more days: September 26 (Tuesday), 25 (Monday), 24 (Sunday), 23 (Saturday). Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the date. Wait, if I subtract 77 days from October 4, 2022, that would be September 27, 2022. Then subtract 4 more days: September 26 (Tuesday), 25 (Monday), 24 (Sunday), 23 (Saturday). Wait, that would be Saturday. But earlier I thought it was Friday. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the date calculation. Let me check. Let's count the days step by step. Starting from October 4, 2022. Let's subtract 7 days: October 4 - 7 days is September 27. Then subtract another 7 days: September 20. Then another 7: September 13. Then another 7: September 6. Then another 7: August 29. Then another 7: August 22. Then another 7: August 15. Then another 7: August 8. Then another 7: August 1. Then another 7: July 25. That's 11 weeks (77 days). So 77 days before October 4 is July 25, 2022. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I messed up the date subtraction. Let me check again. Wait, October 4 minus 7 days is September 27. Then subtract 7 more days: September 20. Then subtract 7: September 13. Then subtract 7: September 6. Then subtract 7: August 29. Then subtract 7: August 22. Then subtract 7: August 15. Then subtract 7: August 8. Then subtract 7: August 1. Then subtract 7: July 25. So that's 11 weeks (77 days) before October 4, 2022, which is July 25, 2022. Then subtract 4 more days: July 24 (Monday), July 23 (Sunday), July 22 (Saturday), July 21 (Friday). So that would be Friday. Wait, but earlier when I thought subtracting 77 days was September 27, that was wrong. So the correct date is July 25, 2022. Then subtract 4 days to get to July 21, 2022. So July 21, 2022, is the date 81 days before October 4, 2022. Now, what day of the week is July 21, 2022?\n\nWait, but the user said that October 4, 2022, is a Tuesday. So if I go back 81 days, which is 11 weeks and 4 days, then the day of the week should be Tuesday minus 4 days. Tuesday minus 1 day is Monday, minus 2 is Sunday, minus 3 is Saturday, minus 4 is Friday. So that would be Friday. But if I check the actual date, July 21, 2022, what day was that? Let me check. Wait, I can use an online calendar or my knowledge. Wait, I remember that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. So July 1 is Friday. Then July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday, July 5 is Tuesday, July 6 is Wednesday, July 7 is Thursday, July 8 is Friday. So July 8 is Friday. Then July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday. Wait, so July 22, 2022, is a Friday. Then July 21 would be Thursday. Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if July 22 is Friday, then July 21 is Thursday. But according to the previous calculation, subtracting 4 days from Tuesday (October 4) would be Friday. But according to the date calculation, July 21 is Thursday. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the date subtraction. Let me check again. Let's count the days from July 21 to October 4. July has 31 days, so July 21 to July 31 is 11 days. August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. September has 30 days, adding 30 days. Then October 4 is 4 days. So total days from July 21 to October 4 is 11 + 31 + 30 + 4 = 76 days. Wait, but that's only 76 days. But we need 81 days. So that means July 21 is 76 days before October 4. Therefore, 81 days before would be 76 + 5 days before July 21. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should count the days from July 21 to October 4. Let me do that again. July 21 to July 31 is 11 days (including July 21?), no, wait. From July 21 to July 31 is 10 days (July 22 to July 31 is 10 days, plus July 21 is 11 days). Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. September has 30 days, adding 30 days. Then October 4 is 4 days. So total is 11 + 31 + 30 + 4 = 76 days. So July 21 is 76 days before October 4. Therefore, 81 days before would be 76 + 5 days before July 21. Wait, that's not right. Wait, if July 21 is 76 days before October 4, then 81 days before would be 76 + 5 days before July 21. Wait, no. Wait, if July 21 is 76 days before October 4, then 81 days before October 4 would be 76 + 5 days before July 21. Wait, that's not correct. Let me think again. If I want to find the date that is 81 days before October 4, I can subtract 81 days from October 4. So October 4 minus 81 days. Let's do that step by step. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 81 days. Let's subtract 31 days (October) to get September 4. Then subtract another 31 days (September) to get August 4. Then subtract another 31 days (August) to get July 4. That's 31 + 31 + 31 = 93 days, which is more than 81. So that's not right. Let me try again. October 4 minus 81 days. Let's subtract 77 days (11 weeks) to get to July 25, 2022. Then subtract 4 more days: July 25 minus 4 days is July 21. So July 21 is 81 days before October 4. But according to the previous calculation, July 21 is 76 days before October 4. That's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days is correct. 11 weeks is 77 days. 77 + 4 = 81. So if I subtract 77 days from October 4, I get July 25. Then subtract 4 more days to get July 21. But according to the other calculation, July 21 is 76 days before October 4. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations. Let me check the days between July 21 and October 4 again. July has 31 days. From July 21 to July 31 is 11 days (including July 21). August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October 4 is 4 days. So total is 11 + 31 + 30 + 4 = 76 days. So July 21 is 76 days before October 4. Therefore, 81 days before would be 76 + 5 days before July 21. Wait, that would be July 16. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I should count the days from July 21 to October 4 as 76 days, so 81 days before would be 76 + 5 days before July 21. Wait, that's not correct. If July 21 is 76 days before October 4, then 81 days before would be 76 + 5 days before July 21. Wait, that's not right. Let me think of it as October 4 minus 81 days. Let's count backward. October 4 minus 1 day is September 23. Minus 2 days is September 22. Minus 3 days is September 21. Minus 4 days is September 20. Minus 5 days is September 19. Minus 6 days is September 18. Minus 7 days is September 17. Minus 8 days is September 16. Minus 9 days is September 15. Minus 10 days is September 14. Minus 11 days is September 13. Minus 12 days is September 12. Minus 13 days is September 11. Minus 14 days is September 10. Minus 15 days is September 9. Minus 16 days is September 8. Minus 17 days is September 7. Minus 18 days is September 6. Minus 19 days is September 5. Minus 20 days is September 4. Minus 21 days is September 3. Minus 22 days is September 2. Minus 23 days is September 1. Minus 24 days is August 31. Minus 25 days is August 30. Minus 26 days is August 29. Minus 27 days is August 28. Minus 28 days is August 27. Minus 29 days is August 26. Minus 30 days is August 25. Minus 31 days is August 24. Minus 32 days is August 23. Minus 33 days is August 22. Minus 34 days is August 21. Minus 35 days is August 20. Minus 36 days is August 19. Minus 37 days is August 18. Minus 38 days is August 17. Minus 39 days is August 16. Minus 40 days is August 15. Minus 41 days is August 14. Minus 42 days is August 13. Minus 43 days is August 12. Minus 44 days is August 11. Minus 45 days is August 10. Minus 46 days is August 9. Minus 47 days is August 8. Minus 48 days is August 7. Minus 49 days is August 6. Minus 50 days is August 5. Minus 51 days is August 4. Minus 52 days is August 3. Minus 53 days is August 2. Minus 54 days is August 1. Minus 55 days is July 31. Minus 56 days is July 30. Minus 57 days is July 29. Minus 58 days is July 28. Minus 59 days is July 27. Minus 60 days is July 26. Minus 61 days is July 25. Minus 62 days is July 24. Minus 63 days is July 23. Minus 64 days is July 22. Minus 65 days is July 21. Wait, that's 65 days. But I need to go back 81 days. So this is getting too tedious. Maybe I should use another approach. Let me check the actual date. If October 4, 2022, is a Tuesday, then 81 days before that would be... Let me use the fact that 7 days before is Tuesday minus 7 days, which is Tuesday again. So 77 days before is also Tuesday. Then 81 days before is 4 days before Tuesday, which is Friday. But according to the date calculation, July 21 is 76 days before, and 81 days before would be 5 days before July 21, which is July 16. But if July 21 is Thursday, then July 16 would be Saturday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. So there's a problem here. I think the mistake is in the date calculation. Maybe I should use an online calendar or a different method. Alternatively, I can use the fact that July 25, 2022, is 77 days before October 4, 2022. Then 77 + 4 = 81 days before. So July 25 minus 4 days is July 21. If July 25 is a Tuesday, then July 21 would be Friday. Wait, but earlier I thought July 22 was Friday. Let me check that again. If July 22"], [99, "If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so first, I need to figure out how many days are there from January 1st to March 25th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the year. Since the first day of the year is a Saturday, I assume it's a non-leap year unless specified otherwise. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention whether it's a leap year or not. Hmm. But March 25th is before February 29th, so if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. However, since the question doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a common year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that it doesn't matter? Wait, no, because if it's a leap year, the number of days in February would be different. But since the first day of the year is Saturday, maybe the year is not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed to not require knowing that. Wait, but I need to check.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the first day of the year was a Saturday\". So if it's a leap year, then February has 29 days. But since March 25th is after February, the number of days in February would affect the total days from January 1st to March 25th. So maybe I need to check if the year is a leap year. But how?\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify whether it's a leap year or not. Hmm. But maybe the answer is the same regardless? Or maybe the problem assumes a non-leap year. Let me think. For example, if the year is a leap year, then the total days from January 1st to March 25th would be 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 25 (Mar) = 85 days. If it's a non-leap year, then it's 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. So the difference is one day. Therefore, the day of the week would be different depending on whether it's a leap year or not. But the problem doesn't specify. Wait, but maybe the problem is set in a specific year where the first day is Saturday. For example, if the year is 2023, which is not a leap year, and January 1st was a Sunday. But in this problem, January 1st is a Saturday. So maybe the problem is assuming a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is set in a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to not require knowing whether it's a leap year. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a year where the first day is Saturday, and the year is not a leap year. Let me check. For example, if January 1st is a Saturday, then the next year's January 1st would be a Sunday if it's a common year, or a Monday if it's a leap year. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to assume that the year is not a leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to have the same answer regardless. Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, assuming it's a non-leap year. Then, January has 31 days, February 28, March 25. So total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but wait, if I'm calculating from January 1st to March 25th, inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, the first day is January 1st, so if I want to find the day of the week for March 25th, I need to count the number of days from January 1st to March 25th, then take that number modulo 7. Because each week has 7 days. So if January 1st is a Saturday, then adding 1 day would be Sunday, 2 days Monday, etc.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 25th. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year), so adding 28 days. Then March 25th is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but that's 84 days. But if January 1st is day 1, then March 25th is day 84. But wait, if you count from day 1 (Jan 1) to day 84 (March 25), then the number of days between them is 83 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have day 1 as Jan 1, then day 2 is Jan 2, etc. So the number of days between Jan 1 and March 25 is 84 - 1 = 83 days? Or is it 84 days? Wait, this is a common confusion. Let me think again. If I have a date that is N days after January 1st, then the day of the week is (original day + N) mod 7. So if January 1st is Saturday, then January 2nd is Sunday, etc. So to find the day of the week for March 25th, I need to find how many days are between January 1st and March 25th, inclusive? Or exclusive?\n\nWait, if I have January 1st as day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. But the problem is that the first day is Saturday. So if I want to find the day of the week for March 25th, I need to calculate the number of days from January 1st to March 25th, then take that number modulo 7. Because each day of the week cycles every 7 days. So if January 1st is Saturday (day 0), then day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, etc. So if March 25th is N days after January 1st, then the day of the week is (Saturday + N) mod 7. So the key is to find N.\n\nSo, how many days are between January 1st and March 25th? Let's calculate:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (non-leap year), so adding 28 days. Then March 25th is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but that would mean that March 25th is 84 days after January 1st. But if January 1st is day 0, then day 84 would be 84 days later. But if you count from day 0 (Jan 1) to day 84 (March 25), that's 84 days. But the number of days between them is 84 days. So the day of the week would be (Saturday + 84) mod 7. Since 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 84 mod 7 is 0. So Saturday + 0 days is Saturday. But that can't be right because March 25th is not the same day as January 1st. Wait, that suggests that March 25th is also a Saturday? That seems unlikely. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let's check again. If January 1st is Saturday, then January 8th is also Saturday. Then January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. So March 26th would be a Saturday. Therefore, March 25th would be Friday. So that would be the answer. But according to the previous calculation, if March 25th is 84 days after January 1st, then 84 mod 7 is 0, so same day. But that contradicts the manual count. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! The mistake is in the calculation of the number of days. Because if January 1st is day 0, then day 1 is January 2nd, day 2 is January 3rd, etc. So the number of days between January 1st and March 25th is 84 days, but that would mean that March 25th is 84 days after January 1st. However, if you count the days from January 1st to March 25th inclusive, that's 84 days. But if you want to find how many days after January 1st, March 25th is, it's 84 - 1 = 83 days. Wait, no. Let me think again. If January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and March 25th is 84 days. But if you want to find how many days after January 1st, March 25th is, it's 84 - 1 = 83 days. Wait, this is confusing. Let me use a different approach.\n\nLet me count the days step by step. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 25th is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. But if January 1st is day 1, then March 25th is day 84. So the number of days between January 1st and March 25th is 83 days. Because day 1 is January 1st, day 2 is January 2nd, ..., day 84 is March 25th. So the difference between day 84 and day 1 is 83 days. Therefore, the number of days after January 1st is 83 days. Therefore, the day of the week would be (Saturday + 83) mod 7. Let's calculate 83 divided by 7. 7*11=77, 83-77=6. So 83 mod 7 is 6. So Saturday + 6 days. Saturday is 0, Sunday 1, Monday 2, Tuesday 3, Wednesday 4, Thursday 5, Friday 6. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. Therefore, March 25th is a Friday. That matches the manual count earlier. So the answer should be Friday.\n\nBut wait, why did the initial calculation of 84 days give a different result? Because I was considering the number of days from January 1st to March 25th as 84 days, but if you start counting from day 1 (Jan 1), then March 25th is day 84, so the number of days after Jan 1 is 83. Therefore, the correct number of days to add is 83. So 83 mod 7 is 6, which is Friday. So the answer is Friday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another method. Let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Saturday. Let's count the days in each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Then January 8th is Saturday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. So March 26th is Saturday. Therefore, March 25th is Friday. That's the same as before. So the answer is Friday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Friday.", "Friday"], [99, "Determine the day of the month for the third Thursday in November 2022. Express your answer as a number.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Thursday would be the 3rd. Because November 1 is Tuesday, so the next day is Wednesday (2nd), then Thursday is the 3rd. So the first Thursday is the 3rd. Then the second Thursday would be the 10th, and the third would be the 17th. Wait, but wait, let me check again. If the first Thursday is the 3rd, then adding 7 days would be the 10th, then another 7 days is the 17th. So the third Thursday would be the 17th. But I need to make sure that November 2022 actually has that many days. November has 30 days, so the 17th is definitely in there. So the answer should be 17. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me check again. Let me think of another way. Maybe I can look up the calendar for November 2022. Wait, I can't actually look it up, but maybe I can calculate it. Let's see. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then November 2 is Wednesday, November 3 is Thursday. So first Thursday is 3rd. Then adding 7 days: 3 +7=10, so 10th is second Thursday. Then 10+7=17, so third Thursday is 17th. Then 17+7=24, which would be the fourth Thursday. So yes, the third Thursday is the 17th.

Hmm, first, I should figure out the dates of each Thursday in that range.\n\nFirst, let me check what day of the week April 3, 2022, is. The user said it's a Sunday. So April 3 is a Sunday. Then the next day, April 4, would be a Monday, and so on. Let me confirm that. Wait, maybe I should check the actual calendar for 2022 to be sure. But since I can't look it up, I'll have to rely on my knowledge.\n\nWait, I remember that April 3, 2022, was a Sunday. So the first Thursday after that would be April 7, 2022. Let me count: April 3 (Sun), 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu). Yes, that's correct. So the first Thursday is April 7.\n\nNow, I need to find all Thursdays from April 7 up to June 28, 2022. Let's break this down into months. April, May, and June.\n\nStarting with April. April has 30 days. The first Thursday is April 7. Then each subsequent Thursday is 7 days later. So the Thursdays in April would be 7, 14, 21, 28. Let me check: April 7 is Thursday, then adding 7 days: 14, 21, 28. That's four Thursdays in April.\n\nNow May. May has 31 days. The next Thursday after April 28 is May 4 (since April 28 is a Thursday, adding 7 days is May 5? Wait, wait. Wait, April 28 is a Thursday. Then May 1 is a Friday. So May 2 is Saturday, May 3 is Sunday, May 4 is Monday? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, April 3 is Sunday. April 7 is Thursday. Then April 14 is Thursday, 21, 28. Then May 5 would be the next Thursday? Wait, April 28 is Thursday. Then May 1 is Friday. So May 2 is Saturday, May 3 is Sunday, May 4 is Monday, May 5 is Tuesday, May 6 is Wednesday, May 7 is Thursday. Oh, right! So the next Thursday after April 28 is May 7. Wait, that's a problem. Because April 28 is Thursday, then May 5 is the next Thursday? Wait, no. Let me count again.\n\nApril 28 is Thursday. Then May 1 is Friday. So May 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu). So May 7 is the next Thursday. So that's correct. So in May, the Thursdays would be May 7, 14, 21, 28. Wait, May has 31 days. So May 28 is a Thursday, then May 29 is Friday, 30 Saturday, 31 Sunday. So the next Thursday would be June 1. Wait, but May 28 is Thursday. Then May 28 + 7 days is June 4? Wait, no. Wait, May 28 is Thursday. Then May 29 is Friday, 30 Saturday, 31 Sunday. Then June 1 is Monday, June 2 is Tuesday, June 3 is Wednesday, June 4 is Thursday. So the next Thursday after May 28 is June 4. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. So maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. If May 7 is Thursday, then adding 7 days: May 14, 21, 28. Then June 4 would be the next Thursday. So in May, there are four Thursdays: 7, 14, 21, 28. Then June 4 is the next one. But the end date is June 28. So let's check June.\n\nJune 4 is Thursday. Then June 11, 18, 25. Then the next one would be July 2, but that's beyond the end date of June 28. So in June, the Thursdays are 4, 11, 18, 25. That's four Thursdays. So total Thursdays would be April (4) + May (4) + June (4) = 12? Wait, but wait, the end date is June 28. Let me check if June 25 is a Thursday. June 4 is Thursday. Then adding 7 days: 11, 18, 25. Then 25 + 7 is July 2. So June 25 is a Thursday. So June 25 is within the range. So that's four Thursdays in June. So total is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. But wait, the start date is April 3 (Sunday), which is included. So the first Thursday is April 7. So that's correct. But wait, let me check if June 28 is a Tuesday. The end date is Tuesday, June 28. So June 28 is a Tuesday. So the last Thursday before that would be June 25. So that's included. So total of 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 Thursdays. But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each month again.\n\nApril: 7, 14, 21, 28. That's four.\n\nMay: 7, 14, 21, 28. Four.\n\nJune: 4, 11, 18, 25.

So that's correct. So 12 Thursdays. But wait, maybe I need to check if there's an extra one. Let me count the days between April 3 and June 28.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but that might not be accurate because of the start and end days. Alternatively, maybe I can check each month's Thursdays again.\n\nWait, April 3 is Sunday. So April 7 is Thursday. Then April 14, 21, 28. That's four. Then May 7, 14, 21, 28. That's four. Then June 4, 11, 18, 25. That's four. So 12 total. But wait, let me check if June 25 is indeed a Thursday. Let's see. If June 4 is Thursday, then June 11 is Thursday, 18, 25. So yes. So that's correct. So the answer should be 12. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the May dates. Let me check May 7. If April 28 is Thursday, then May 5 is the next Thursday? Wait, no. Wait, April 28 is Thursday. Then May 1 is Friday. So May 2 is Saturday, 3 Sunday, 4 Monday, 5 Tuesday, 6 Wednesday, 7 Thursday. So May 7 is Thursday. So that's correct. So May 7, 14, 21, 28. That's four. So yes. So total 12. But wait, the end date is June 28. So June 25 is included. So that's correct. So the answer is 12. But wait, maybe I should check with another approach. Let's count the number of weeks between the dates. From April 3 to June 28. Let's calculate the total number of days. April has 30 days, so from April 3 to April 30 is 28 days. Then May has 31 days, and June 28 days. So total days from April 3 to June 28 is 28 (April) + 31 (May) + 28 (June) = 87 days. Wait, but that's from April 3 to June 28 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if you take April 3 to April 30, that's 28 days (since April 3 is day 1, April 4 is day 2, ..., April 30 is day 28). Then May has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then June 28 is 28 days. So total is 28 + 31 + 28 = 87 days. But that's the total number of days from April 3 to June 28 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on April 3, then the number of days from April 3 to April 30 is 28 days (since April 3 is day 1, April 4 is day 2, ..., April 30 is day 28). Then May has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then June 28 is 28 days. So total is 28 + 31 + 28 = 87 days. But that's the total number of days between April 3 and June 28 inclusive? Wait, no. Because if you have 28 days in April (from April 3 to April 30), then May has 31 days, and June 28 days. So total days from April 3 to June 28 is 28 + 31 + 28 = 87 days. But if you divide 87 by 7, you get 12 weeks and 3 days. So that would mean 12 full weeks, which is 12 Thursdays, plus 3 days. But since the start date is a Sunday, the first day is Sunday, so the first Thursday is the 4th day. Then the next weeks would have 4 Thursdays each. But if there are 12 weeks, that's 12 Thursdays. But the remaining 3 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So the end date is Tuesday, which is the last day. So the total number of Thursdays would be 12. So that matches the previous count.

First, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those days are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to find out what day of the week April 12, 2022, was, and then count the Mondays from there. Let me check. April 12, 2022, was a Tuesday. So if I start on Tuesday, then the next day is Wednesday, and so on. Let me confirm that. Let me think, maybe I can use a calendar or some method to find the days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but since the start and end dates might not align perfectly, I need to adjust for that. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days from April 12 to June 1, inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end dates, it's 18 + 1 = 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have from day X to day Y inclusive, the number of days is Y - X + 1. So April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days, and June 1 is one day. So total days would be 19 (April) + 31 (May) + 1 (June) = 51 days? Wait, but wait, the end date is June 1, so if April 12 is day 1, then April 13 is day 2, etc. Wait, but maybe I should check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calculator or a formula. But since I can't do that, I need to calculate manually. Let me check:\n\nApril 12, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nFirst, April has 30 days. So from April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since we include both ends, it's 18 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days, and June 1 is one day. So total days from April 12 to June 1 inclusive is 19 + 31 + 1 = 51 days. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Wait, April 12 to April 30 is 19 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 19 + 31 = 50 days. Then June 1 is one more day, so total 51 days. So total 51 days in the period.\n\nNow, if there are 51 days, then the number of weeks is 51 divided by 7. 7*7=49, so 51-49=2 days. So there are 7 full weeks (49 days) and 2 extra days. So the number of Mondays would be 7 plus the number of Mondays in those two extra days.\n\nBut wait, the starting day is Tuesday, April 12. So the first day is Tuesday. Then the next day is Wednesday, and so on. So the first day of the period is Tuesday. So the first Monday would be the day before Tuesday, which is Monday, April 11. But wait, April 11, 2022, was a Monday? Wait, but the period starts on April 12, so April 11 is not included. So the first Monday in the period would be April 18, 2022? Let me check.\n\nWait, April 12 is Tuesday. So April 13 is Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday. So the first Monday in the period is April 18. Then the next Mondays would be every 7 days. So April 18, 23, 25? Wait, wait, April 18 is Monday. Then adding 7 days: April 25 (Monday), then May 2 (Monday), May 9, 16, 23, 30, then June 6, 13, 20, 27. Wait, but the period ends on June 1. So June 1 is the end date. So let's list all the Mondays in the period.\n\nStarting from April 18 (Monday), then:\n\nApril 18, 25 (since April has 30 days, 18 + 7 = 25, which is still in April). Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Then June 6, 13. But June 1 is the end date, so June 6 is after June 1. So June 6 is not included. So the Mondays in the period are:\n\nApril 18, 25 (2 Mondays in April)\n\nMay 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5 Mondays in May)\n\nJune 6 is after June 1, so not included. So total Mondays would be 2 + 5 = 7?\n\nWait, but that's only 7 Mondays. But the total days are 51, which is 7 weeks and 2 days. So 7 Mondays plus 1 more if the extra days include a Monday. Wait, but the first day is Tuesday, so the first day of the period is Tuesday, and the last day is Wednesday, June 1. So the extra two days would be the 49th day (which is Tuesday) and the 50th day (Wednesday). So the extra days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So there's no extra Monday. Therefore, the total number of Mondays would be 7. But wait, according to my previous count, there are 2 in April, 5 in May, total 7. So that's 7 Mondays. But wait, maybe I missed some?\n\nWait, let me check again. April 18 is Monday. Then April 25 is next. Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 2 + 5 = 7. Then June 6 is the next Monday, but June 1 is the end date. So that's correct. So total 7 Mondays. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again the total days between April 12 and June 1 inclusive.\n\nApril 12 to April 30: 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. May has 31 days. June 1 is 1 day. So total is 19 + 31 + 1 = 51 days. So 51 days. 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 2 days. So 7 Mondays. But wait, if the first day is Tuesday, then the first Monday is the 7th day (since Tuesday is day 1, then Monday is day 7). Wait, but that would be April 18. Then the next Mondays would be day 14 (April 18 + 7 days is April 25), then day 21 (May 2), 28 (May 9), 35 (May 16), 42 (May 23), 49 (May 30), and 56 (June 6). But since the total days are 51, the last day is day 51, which is June 1. So day 51 is Wednesday. So the Mondays would be on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49. That's 7 Mondays. So that's correct. So the answer is 7.\n\nBut wait, let me check if April 18 is indeed a Monday. Since April 12 is Tuesday, then April 13 is Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday. Yes, that's correct. So April 18 is Monday. Then adding 7 days, April 25 is Monday. Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 2 in April, 5 in May. Total 7. So the answer is 7.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try again.\n\nIf December 31, 2022, is a Saturday, then December 30 is Friday, December 29 is Thursday, December 28 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday is the 28th. Then the second Wednesday would be the 4th of January 2023. But that can't be right because the question is about December 2022. So that suggests that the first Wednesday in December is the 28th, which would make the second Wednesday the 4th of January. But that's not possible because December only has 31 days. Wait, that can't be. So there's a mistake here. Maybe my assumption that December 31, 2022, is a Saturday is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another date. Let's think about the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. If that's correct, then the first Wednesday would be the 7th, the second Wednesday the 14th, third the 21st, fourth the 28th. So the second Wednesday would be the 14th. But if December 28 is a Wednesday, then that would be the fourth Wednesday. Wait, that would mean that the first Wednesday is the 7th, second 14th, third 21st, fourth 28th. So the second Wednesday is the 14th. But if December 28 is a Wednesday, then that's the fourth. So that would mean that the first Wednesday is the 7th, second 14th, third 21st, fourth 28th. So the answer would be 14. But how do I confirm that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023, is a Sunday. So December 31, 2022, is the day before, which would be Saturday. Then December 31 is Saturday. So December 30 is Friday, December 29 is Thursday, December 28 is Wednesday. So that would mean that the first Wednesday in December is the 28th. But that contradicts the earlier thought that December 1 is Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if December 28 is a Wednesday, then December 28 + 7 days is January 4, 2023, which would be a Wednesday. But January 1, 2023, is a Sunday. So January 4 would be a Wednesday. That's correct. So that would mean that December 28 is a Wednesday. Therefore, the first Wednesday in December is the 28th. Then the second Wednesday would be the 4th of January 2023. But that's not in December. Therefore, that would mean that there is no second Wednesday in December 2022. But that can't be right. Wait, but if December 28 is a Wednesday, then the first Wednesday is the 28th, and the second would be the 4th of January. So that would mean that the second Wednesday in December 2022 does not exist. Therefore, the answer would be -1. But that contradicts the earlier assumption that December 1 is a Thursday. So there's a conflict here. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for December 1, 2022. Let me check again. If December 28 is a Wednesday, then December 28 - 7 days is December 21, which would be a Wednesday. Then December 14 is a Wednesday, and December 7 is a Wednesday. So that would mean that December 7 is a Wednesday. Therefore, December 1 would be a Thursday. So that's correct. So December 1 is a Thursday. Then the first Wednesday is the 7th, second is the 14th, third is the 21st, fourth is the 28th. So the second Wednesday is the 14th. But according to the other calculation, December 28 is a Wednesday. So that would mean that the first Wednesday is the 28th. But that's conflicting. \n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to list the days for December 2022. If December 1 is a Thursday, then:\n\nDec 1: Thu\n\nDec 2: Fri\n\nDec 3: Sat\n\nDec 4: Sun\n\nDec 5: Mon\n\nDec 6: Tue\n\nDec 7: Wed (first Wednesday)\n\nDec 8: Thu\n\nDec 9: Fri\n\nDec 10: Sat\n\nDec 11: Sun\n\nDec 12: Mon\n\nDec 13: Tue\n\nDec 14: Wed (second Wednesday)\n\nDec 15: Thu\n\n... and so on. So the second Wednesday is the 14th. Then the fourth Wednesday is the 28th. So that would mean that the second Wednesday is the 14th. But earlier, when I thought that December 28 is a Wednesday, that would be the fourth Wednesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the second Wednesday is the 14th. So the answer should be 14. But why did I get confused earlier when I thought that December 28 is a Wednesday? Because if December 28 is a Wednesday, then that's the fourth Wednesday. So the first is 7th, second 14th, third 21st, fourth 28th. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 14. \n\nBut then why did I think that December 28 is a Wednesday? Because I thought that December 31 is a Saturday, so December 28 is a Wednesday. Let me check that again. If December 31 is a Saturday, then December 30 is Friday, December 29 is Thursday, December 28 is Wednesday. So that's correct. So that would mean that the first Wednesday is the 28th? But that's not possible because December 7 is a Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, this must mean that my assumption that December 31 is a Saturday is wrong. Because if December 1 is a Thursday, then December 31 is 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So December 1 is Thursday, adding 2 days would be Saturday. So December 31 is Saturday. Therefore, December 28 is Wednesday. But that would mean that December 7 is a Wednesday, and December 28 is also a Wednesday. That's 21 days apart, which is 3 weeks. So that's correct. So December 7 is Wednesday, then 14th, 21st, 28th. So the second Wednesday is the 14th. Therefore, the answer is 14. \n\nSo the confusion was because I thought that December 28 is the first Wednesday, but that's not the case. The first Wednesday is the 7th, then the second is the 14th. So the answer is 14. Therefore, the event on the second Wednesday would be on the 14th of December 2022.", "14"], [99, "Between Saturday, March 19, 2022 and Sunday, May 8, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? State the amount as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between March 19, 2022 (Saturday) and May 8, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday. So weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total days. March 19 is a Saturday. Let me check the dates. March has 31 days, so March 19 to March 31 is 13 days (including March 19). Then April has 30 days, and May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total days would be 13 (March) + 30 (April) + 8 (May) = 51 days. Wait, but wait, March 19 to March 31 is 13 days? Let me check that again. March 19 is day 1. March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13. Yes, that's correct. Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days. Then May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total days from March 19 to May 8 inclusive is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. Wait, but maybe I should check using another method. Alternatively, using a date calculator or knowing the days of the week.\n\nBut since I don't have a calendar here, maybe I can calculate the number of weekends. Let's think about the first day, March 19 is a Saturday. So the first day is a Saturday. Then March 20 is Sunday, March 21 is Monday, and so on. So in March, starting from March 19 (Saturday), the weekends would be March 19 (Saturday), March 20 (Sunday), March 26 (Saturday), March 27 (Sunday), March 31 (Friday? Wait, March 31 is a Friday? Wait, March 19 is Saturday. Let me count the days. March 19 is Saturday. March 20 is Sunday. March 21 is Monday. March 22 is Tuesday. March 23 is Wednesday. March 24 is Thursday. March 25 is Friday. March 26 is Saturday. March 27 is Sunday. March 28 is Monday. March 29 is Tuesday. March 30 is Wednesday. March 31 is Thursday. Wait, so March 31 is a Thursday. So in March, the weekends are March 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 4 weekends in March. So that's 4 days. Then April has 30 days. Let's see how many weekends are in April. April 1 is a Friday (since March 31 is Thursday, April 1 is Friday). So April 1 is Friday, April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. Then April 4 is Monday, etc. So in April, the weekends would be every Saturday and Sunday. Let's calculate how many weeks there are in April. April has 30 days. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks would be 8 days (4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays). Then the remaining 2 days are April 29 (Saturday) and April 30 (Sunday). Wait, wait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. Then April 4 is Monday. So the first week of April has 2 days (Sat and Sun). Then each subsequent week has 2 days. Wait, maybe I should list the weekends. Let's see:\n\nApril 1: Friday\nApril 2: Saturday (weekend)\nApril 3: Sunday (weekend)\nApril 4: Monday\nApril 5: Tuesday\nApril 6: Wednesday\nApril 7: Thursday\nApril 8: Friday\nApril 9: Saturday (weekend)\nApril 10: Sunday (weekend)\nApril 11: Monday\n... and so on. So every 7 days, there are two weekend days. So in 30 days, how many weekends? Let's see. 30 days is 4 weeks (28 days) plus 2 days. So 4 weeks have 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. Then the remaining 2 days are April 29 (Saturday) and April 30 (Sunday). So that's 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. Wait, but April 29 is Saturday, April 30 is Sunday. So that's 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays? Wait, no. Wait, in the first 28 days (4 weeks), there are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. Then the next two days are April 29 (Saturday) and April 30 (Sunday). So that's 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. So total of 10 weekend days in April. Wait, but that would be 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. So 10 days. But April has 30 days. Let me check again. If April 1 is Friday, then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. Then April 8 is Friday again. So the first week (April 1-7) has 2 weekend days. Then the next week (April 8-14) has 2 weekend days. Then April 15-21: 2 weekend days. April 22-28: 2 weekend days. Then April 29-30: 2 weekend days. So that's 5 weeks, each with 2 weekend days. So 5*2=10 weekend days. So April has 10 weekend days. Then May 1 is Monday (since April 30 is Sunday). So May 1 is Monday. Then May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 is Wednesday, May 4 is Thursday, May 5 is Friday, May 6 is Saturday, May 7 is Sunday, May 8 is Monday. So in May, the weekend days are May 6 (Saturday) and May 7 (Sunday). So that's 2 weekend days in May. So total weekends in the entire period are March (4) + April (10) + May (2) = 16 weekend days. So total days between March 19 and May 8 inclusive is 51 days. So business days would be 51 - 16 = 35 days. Wait, but let me check again. Wait, March 19 is Saturday, so that's a weekend day. So the total days are 51. If there are 16 weekend days, then 51-16=35 business days. But let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check again. March: 4 weekend days. April: 10. May: 2. Total 16. So 51-16=35. But maybe I should check the total days again. Let me count the days between March 19 and May 8 inclusive. March 19 to March 31 is 13 days. April has 30 days. May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So 13+30+8=51. Yes. So 51 days total. So 51-16=35. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of weekends. Let me check March again. March 19 is Saturday. March 20 is Sunday. March 26 is Saturday. March 27 is Sunday. March 31 is Thursday. So that's 4 weekend days in March. Correct. April: 10. May: 2. So 16. So 51-16=35. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let's count the business days directly. Starting from March 19 (Saturday), which is a weekend. So the first business day is March 21 (Monday). Then March 21 to March 31 is 11 days (March 21 is Monday, March 22 is Tuesday, ..., March 31 is Thursday). Wait, March 21 to March 31 is 11 days. But March 21 is Monday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 23 is Wednesday, March 24 is Thursday, March 25 is Friday, March 26 is Saturday, March 27 is Sunday, March 28 is Monday, March 29 is Tuesday, March 30 is Wednesday, March 31 is Thursday. So from March 21 to March 31, that's 11 days. How many business days? From March 21 (Monday) to March 25 (Friday) is 5 days. Then March 26 (Saturday) is a weekend, March 27 (Sunday) is a weekend. Then March 28 (Monday) to March 31 (Thursday) is 4 days. So total 5+4=9 business days in March. Then April. April 1 is Friday. So April 1 is Friday (business day). April 2 is Saturday (weekend), April 3 is Sunday (weekend). Then April 4 is Monday. So from April 1 to April 30, how many business days? Let's see. April has 30 days. Let's count the number of weeks. April 1 is Friday. So the first week (April 1-7) has 5 business days (Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu). Wait, no. Wait, April 1 is Friday, April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. Then April 4 is Monday, April 5 is Tuesday, April 6 is Wednesday, April 7 is Thursday. So the first week (April 1-7) has 5 business days (Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu). Then the next week (April 8-14) has 5 business days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri). Then April 15-21: 5 business days. April 22-28: 5 business days. April 29-30: 2 days (Sat and Sun are weekends, so only April 29 is Saturday, April 30 is Sunday. So those are weekends. So in April, the business days would be 4 weeks (each with 5 business days) plus 2 days (April 29 and 30 are weekends, so no business days). Wait, but April has 30 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days. So April 1-28 is 4 weeks. Then April 29 and 30 are the remaining two days. So in April, the business days would be 4*5=20 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Because in each week, the business days are 5. But if April 1 is Friday, then the first week (April 1-7) has 5 business days (Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu). Then the next week (April 8-14) has 5 business days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri). Then April 15-21: 5 business days. April 22-28: 5 business days. So that's 4 weeks, 20 business days. Then April 29 is Saturday (weekend), April 30 is Sunday (weekend). So total business days in April is 20. Then May. May 1 is Monday (business day). May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 is Wednesday, May 4 is Thursday, May 5 is Friday. May 6 is Saturday (weekend), May 7 is Sunday (weekend). May 8 is Monday (business day). So from May 1 to May 8, that's 8 days. The business days are May 1-5 (5 days) and May 8 (1 day). So 6 business days in May. So total business days would be March (9) + April (20) + May (6) = 35. Which matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 35. Therefore, the total number of business days is 35.", "35"], [99, "Determine if the year 2043 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2043 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2043 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2043 divided by 4. 4 times 510 is 2040, so 2043 minus 2040 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 2043 is not divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check the century rule just in case. \n\nBut wait, 2043 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. Century years are like 1900, 2000, 2100, etc. Since 2043 isn't divisible by 100, the second condition (divisible by 400) doesn't apply here. So the main thing is whether it's divisible by 4. Since it's not, then it's not a leap year. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me check again. 4 times 500 is 2000. 2043 minus 2000 is 43. 43 divided by 4 is 10.75, so yeah, there's a remainder. So definitely not divisible by 4.

Both dates are included, so I need to check if they are Mondays and count them.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week August 5, 2022, was. Let me recall that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing up the days. Let me check. Wait, maybe I should use a calendar or some method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, but if that's the case, then the next day, August 6, would be Saturday, August 7 Sunday, August 8 Monday. So the first Monday after August 5 would be August 8. Then the next Mondays would be every 7 days. Let me list them out.\n\nStarting from August 5 (Friday), the Mondays would be:\n\nAugust 8 (Monday), then August 15, 22, and 29. Wait, August 29 is the end date. So that's four Mondays? Let me check each date.\n\nWait, August 5 is Friday. So August 6 is Saturday, 7 Sunday, 8 Monday. Then 15, 22, 29. So that's four Mondays. But wait, August 29 is included. So that's four Mondays. But wait, let me confirm the dates again.\n\nWait, August 5 is Friday. Then August 8 is Monday. Then adding 7 days: 8 +7=15, 15+7=22, 22+7=29. So that's four Mondays. But wait, August 29 is a Monday? Let me check. If August 8 is Monday, then adding 21 days (3 weeks) would be August 29. So yes, that's correct. So the Mondays are 8, 15, 22, 29. That's four Mondays. But wait, the start date is August 5, which is Friday, and the end date is August 29, which is Monday. So including both dates, the Mondays are 8, 15, 22, 29. So that's four Mondays. Therefore, the answer should be 4.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another way.

From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 1950. First, divide 1950 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 487 is 1948, so 1950 minus 1948 is 2. That means 1950 divided by 4 is 487.5, which isn't a whole number. So 1950 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that division. Let me add 4 to 1948: 1948 + 4 is 1952, so 1950 is two years after 1948, which is a leap year. So 1950 is not a leap year.

Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards to find other dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 16, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about the days in May. May has 31 days. Let's see, if I can find the day of the week for a known date in May 2022, then I can count the days from there.\n\nWait, I think May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Sundays. So May 15 would be a Sunday. Then May 16 would be a Monday. But wait, is that correct? Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then adding 14 days (two weeks) would be May 15, which is also Sunday. Then May 16 would be Monday. But I need to confirm if May 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the year 2022. I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then January 2 was Sunday, and so on. Let's count the days from January 1 to May 16.\n\nFirst, January has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31 days, April has 30 days, and May 16 is the date we need.\n\nSo from January 1 to May 16, how many days is that?\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 16 days\n\nTotal days from January 1 to May 16 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 16 = let's calculate that step by step. 31 + 28 is 59. 59 + 31 is 90. 90 + 30 is 120. 120 + 16 is 136 days. So May 16 is 136 days after January 1, 2022.\n\nNow, since January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, we can find the day of the week by calculating 136 days later. Since each week has 7 days, we can divide 136 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell us how many days ahead we are from Saturday.\n\n136 divided by 7 is 19 weeks and 3 days (since 19*7=133, 136-133=3). So 136 days later is 19 weeks and 3 days. Therefore, adding 3 days to Saturday: Saturday + 1 day is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday. So May 16, 2022 would be a Tuesday?\n\nWait, but earlier I thought May 1 was Sunday. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 16 would be 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 1 day is Monday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion of Tuesday. So there's a mistake here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this inconsistency suggests I made an error in one of the calculations. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, let's verify the day of the week for January 1, 2022. I think that's correct. Let me check an online source or a calendar. Wait, I can't access external resources, but I can use another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. That seems correct. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday.\n\nNow, let's count the days from January 1 to May 16. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so 28 days. March has 31 days, April has 30 days. Then May 16 is 16 days into May. So total days from January 1 to May 16 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 16 (May) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+16=136. So 136 days. Correct.\n\nNow, 136 divided by 7 is 19*7=133, remainder 3. So 136 days later is 3 days after Saturday. Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday. So May 16 would be Tuesday. But earlier, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 16 is 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 1 day is Monday. So which is correct?\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that one of the assumptions is wrong. Let me check the May 1 date. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 1 + 14 days is May 15, which would also be Sunday. Then May 16 would be Monday. But according to the other calculation, it's Tuesday. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, one of the steps is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 is Saturday is incorrect. Let me check again. If January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. That seems correct. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday.\n\nNow, let's check May 1, 2022. Let's count the days from January 1 to May 1. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28 days, March 31 days. So up to March 31, that's 31 + 28 + 31 = 90 days. Then April has 30 days, so April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120 days. So May 1 is 121 days after January 1. 121 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 2 days. So 17 weeks is 119 days, so 121 days is 17 weeks and 2 days. So January 1 is Saturday, adding 2 days would be Monday. Therefore, May 1, 2022 is a Monday. Wait, that contradicts the earlier assumption that May 1 was Sunday. So that's the mistake. Earlier, I thought May 1 was Sunday, but according to this calculation, it's Monday. So that's where the error was.\n\nSo if May 1 is Monday, then May 16 is 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Monday + 1 day is Tuesday. Therefore, May 16, 2022 is Tuesday. That matches the first calculation. So the correct answer is Tuesday.\n\nAlternatively, let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's count the days from July 4 to May 16. Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, let's check May 16, 2022. If May 1 is Monday, then May 8 is Monday, May 15 is Monday, so May 16 is Tuesday. That's correct. So the answer should be Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [99, "On which weekday did April 5, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week April 5, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I might remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I remember that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me think. If April 1 is a Friday, then April 5 would be two days later, so Sunday? Wait, April 1 is Friday, April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday, April 4 is Monday, April 5 is Tuesday? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I got the date wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but I need to check that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 5, 2022 is a specific date. Wait, perhaps I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to calculate it manually.\n\nAnother approach: Let's take a known date. For example, I know that April 5, 2021 was a Tuesday. Wait, but that's two years earlier. So 2021 was a non-leap year. So from April 5, 2021 (Tuesday) to April 5, 2022 would be 365 days later. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding one day to Tuesday would make it Wednesday. But wait, that would mean April 5, 2022 is a Wednesday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the previous step. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if April 5, 2021 was a Tuesday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make April 5, 2022 a Wednesday. But I need to confirm if April 5, 2021 was indeed a Tuesday. Alternatively, maybe I can use another reference. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1 is Friday, then April 5 would be Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. So which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday, and so on. Let's count the days from January 1 to April 5. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31 days. April 5 is the 5th day of April. So let's calculate the total days from January 1 to April 5.\n\nJanuary: 31 days (from Jan 1 to Jan 31)\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril 5: 5 days\n\nTotal days from Jan 1 to April 5 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 5 = 95 days. Wait, no. Wait, if I'm counting from January 1 to April 5 inclusive, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 5 (Apr) = 95 days. But if January 1 is Saturday, then 95 days later would be what day of the week?\n\nSince 95 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 4 days. So 13 weeks is 91 days, so 95 days is 13 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Saturday: Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday. So April 5 would be a Wednesday. But earlier I thought April 1 was Friday, which would make April 5 a Tuesday. There's a contradiction here. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can use the fact that April 5, 2022 is the same as the date in 2021 plus 365 days. If April 5, 2021 was a Tuesday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make it Wednesday. But if April 5, 2022 is Wednesday, then that would be correct. However, if April 1, 2022 is Friday, then April 5 would be Tuesday. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another reference. Let me think of a known date in 2022. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1 is Friday, then April 5 is Tuesday. But according to the previous calculation, if January 1 is Saturday, then April 5 is Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I can check the number of days between January 1 and April 1. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so March 1 is 31 + 28 = 59 days after January 1. Then April 1 is 59 + 30 = 89 days after January 1. Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is day 1. Then January 31 is day 31. February 28 is day 31 + 28 = 59. March 31 is day 59 + 31 = 90. So April 1 is day 91. So if January 1 is Saturday, then day 91 is 91 days later. 91 divided by 7 is 13 weeks exactly. So day 91 would be Saturday again. But that would mean April 1 is Saturday. But that contradicts the earlier assumption that April 1 is Friday. So clearly, there's a mistake here. Therefore, my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual day of the week for January 1, 2022. Let me think. I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. But that would mean that January 1, 2022 is Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, April 1 would be Saturday. But that contradicts the idea that April 1 is Friday. Therefore, there's a problem here. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the days between January 1 and April 1. Let me recalculate. January has 31 days. So January 1 is day 1. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is day 31 + 28 = 59. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 59 + 31 = 90. Therefore, April 1 is day 91. So if January 1 is Saturday, then day 91 is Saturday + (91 - 1) days. Wait, no. Wait, day 1 is Saturday. Then day 2 is Sunday, day 3 is Monday, etc. So day 91 is 90 days after Saturday. 90 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 6 days. So 12 weeks later is Saturday again, plus 6 days: Saturday + 6 days is Friday. Wait, that would mean April 1 is Friday. Oh! So that's correct. So if January 1 is Saturday, then April 1 is Friday. That matches the earlier assumption. So then April 5 would be Friday + 4 days = Tuesday. So April 5, 2022 is Tuesday. But earlier, when I calculated from April 5, 2021 (Tuesday) plus 365 days, I thought it would be Wednesday. But that must be wrong. Wait, why is that?\n\nWait, if April 5, 2021 was Tuesday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make it Wednesday. But according to the other calculation, April 5, 2022 is Tuesday. That's a contradiction. Therefore, one of the assumptions is wrong. So which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe April 5, 2021 was not Tuesday. Let me check. If April 1, 2021 was a Thursday, then April 5 would be Monday. But I need to find the correct day for April 1, 2021. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check the number of days between April 5, 2021 and April 5, 2022. Since 2021 is not a leap year, 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if April 5, 2021 was a Tuesday, then April 5, 2022 would be Wednesday. But according to the other calculation, it's Tuesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that April 1, 2022 is Friday is wrong. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then day 91 is April 1. 91 days later. 91 divided by 7 is 13 weeks. So day 91 is Saturday. Wait, but that would mean April 1 is Saturday. But earlier calculation said that day 91 is Friday. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let me re-calculate the days between January 1 and April 1. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90 days. Therefore, April 1 is day 91. So if January 1 is Saturday, then day 91 is 90 days later. 90 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 6 days. So 12 weeks later is Saturday again, plus 6 days: Saturday + 6 days is Friday. So April 1 is Friday. Therefore, April 5 is Friday + 4 days = Tuesday. So that would mean April 5, 2022 is Tuesday. But according to the other method, if April 5, 2021 was Tuesday, then adding 365 days would make it Wednesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe April 5, 2021 was not Tuesday. Let me check. If April 1, 2021 was a Thursday, then April 5 would be Monday. But how do I know what day April 1, 2021 was? Let me think. If January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then January 1, 2021 is Friday. Then, January 1, 2022 is Saturday. So that's correct. Now, to find April 1, 2021. Let's calculate the number of days from January 1, 2021 to April 1, 2021. January has 31 days, February 28, March 31. So 31 + 28 + 31 = 90 days. So April 1 is 90 days after January 1. 90 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 6 days. So if January 1, 2021 is Friday, then 90 days later is Friday + 6 days = Thursday. Therefore, April 1, 2021 is Thursday. Therefore, April 5, 2021 is Thursday + 4 days = Monday. So April 5, 2021 is Monday. Then, adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make April 5, 2022 be Monday + 1 day = Tuesday.

Let me check that. January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30. So 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 = 120. So May 1 is the 121st day. If I can find the day of the week for day 121, 2022. If January 1 is a Saturday, then day 1 is Saturday. Then day 121 would be 120 days later. 120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 1 day. So 120 days later is 17 weeks and 1 day. So Saturday + 1 day is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Therefore, May 13 is 12 days later, which is 12 days after Sunday. 12 divided by 7 is 1 week and 5 days. So Sunday + 5 days is Friday. Therefore, May 13, 2022 is a Friday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that May 13, 2022 is the day in question. Let me think of another way. If I know that May 13, 2022 is a Friday, then what about May 16, 2022? That would be Monday. Wait, but I don't have any other dates to check.

Oh right, because I think 2022 started on a Saturday. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then the first Tuesday would be the 3rd. Let me check that. January 1 is Saturday, so January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday? Wait, no. Wait, Saturday is day 1, Sunday is 2, Monday 3, Tuesday 4. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if January 1 is a Saturday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\nJanuary 2: Sunday\nJanuary 3: Monday\nJanuary 4: Tuesday. Oh right, so the first Tuesday is the 4th. Then the second Tuesday would be the 11th, third is 18th, and fourth is 25th. Wait, let me count again. First Tuesday is 4th, then adding 7 days each time. So 4 +7=11 (second), 11+7=18 (third), 18+7=25 (fourth). So the fourth Tuesday would be the 25th. But wait, does January 2022 have 31 days, so 25th is valid. So the answer should be 25. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again. Maybe I should verify the actual calendar for January 2022. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think. If I know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday, then the first Tuesday is the 4th. Then the fourth Tuesday would be 4 + 3*7 = 4 +21=25. So yes, 25th. But maybe I should check another way. For example, if I look up the actual dates. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the days. Let's list the dates for Tuesdays in January 2022. If the first Tuesday is the 4th, then the next ones are 11, 18, 25. So the fourth is 25. So the answer is 25. Therefore, the fourth Tuesday is on the 25th.

Let's think about the days of the week for October 2022. If I know that October 1 is a Saturday, then the first Friday is the 7th (since 1 is Saturday, 2 Sunday, 3 Monday, 4 Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday).

So I need to count all the Saturdays between those two dates, including both the start and end dates if they are Saturdays.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week each date is. The start date is Sunday, August 28, 2022. Let me confirm that. Wait, August 28, 2022, was a Sunday. Then the next day, August 29, would be a Monday, and so on. The end date is Thursday, September 8, 2022. So I need to check if any of these dates fall on a Saturday.\n\nLet me list out the dates from August 28 to September 8 and note the days of the week.

Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can use my knowledge. Let me think again.\n\nIf August 28 is a Sunday, then August 29 is Monday, August 30 Tuesday, August 31 Wednesday. Then September 1 is Thursday, September 2 Friday, September 3 Saturday. Then September 4 is Sunday. So yes, only September 3 is a Saturday. So that's one Saturday. But wait, the end date is September 8, which is Thursday. So the Saturday is only on September 3. Therefore, the answer should be 1?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting date. Let me check again. Wait, August 28, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. For example, I know that August 28, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check with another method. For example, if I know that August 15, 2022, was a Monday. Then August 16 is Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday, 20 Saturday, 21 Sunday. Wait, that would make August 21 a Sunday. Then August 22 is Monday, 23 Tuesday, 24 Wednesday, 25 Thursday, 26 Friday, 27 Saturday, 28 Sunday. Yes, that's correct. So August 28 is Sunday.

Maybe there's another Saturday?\n\nWait, August 28 is Sunday. The next Saturday is August 28 + 6 days = September 3. Then the next Saturday would be September 10, which is outside the range. So yes, only one Saturday. Therefore, the answer is 1. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have a range that includes multiple weeks, you might have more Saturdays.

And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so I need to figure out the day of the week for March 26, given that January 1st is a Tuesday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are there from January 1st to March 26th. Let me break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since the first day is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question doesn't specify if it's a leap year or not. But since the first day of the year is Tuesday, maybe we can assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed to not require knowing about leap years? Wait, but if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, then the number of days would be different. But since the problem doesn't mention a leap year, maybe we can assume it's a non-leap year. Let me check that assumption.\n\nSo, assuming it's a non-leap year, February has 28 days. So from January 1st to March 26th would be 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 26 (March) days? Wait, no. Wait, the total days from January 1st to March 26th is (31 days in January) + (28 days in February) + 26 days in March? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 31st is day 31. Then February has 28 days, so March 1st is day 31 + 28 = 59. Then March 26th is 59 + 25 = 84 days later? Wait, no. Wait, if March 1st is day 59, then March 26th is 25 days after March 1st (since March 1st is day 1, March 26th is day 26, so 26 - 1 = 25 days later). So total days from January 1st to March 26th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 26 (Mar) = 85 days? Wait, but that would be if you count the days in each month. Wait, no. Wait, the total number of days from January 1st to March 26th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 26 (Mar) = 85 days. But if you start counting from January 1st as day 1, then March 26th is day 85. But the number of days between January 1st and March 26th is 84 days later. Because if you have day 1 as January 1st, then day 2 is January 2nd, etc. So the number of days between January 1st and March 26th is 84 days. Wait, but that depends on how you count. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of days from January 1st to March 26th. Let's do it step by step. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 1st is day 59 + 1 = 60? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 31st is day 31. Then February 1st is day 32. So February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 31 + 28 = 59. Then March 1st is day 60. So March 26th is 26 days after March 1st, so day 60 + 25 = 85. So March 26th is day 85. Therefore, the number of days between January 1st and March 26th is 84 days. Because if January 1st is day 1, then March 26th is day 85, so the difference is 84 days.\n\nSo, if January 1st is a Tuesday, then adding 84 days later would be the same day of the week, because 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 days is 12 weeks, so the same day of the week. Therefore, March 26th would also be a Tuesday? Wait, but that seems too easy. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual number of days in each month. January has 31 days, February 28, March 31. So from January 1st to March 26th is 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But if you count the days between January 1st and March 26th, it's 84 days later. Because if you start on day 1 (Jan 1), then day 2 is Jan 2, etc. So the number of days between Jan 1 and March 26 is 84 days. So 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks. So 12 weeks later is the same day of the week. Therefore, March 26th would be a Tuesday. But wait, that seems correct? But I think maybe I need to check with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's see. January 1st is Tuesday. Then January 8th is also Tuesday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Wait, so March 26th would be a Tuesday? Because March 5th is a Tuesday (since February 26th is a Tuesday, then March 5th is 9 days later, which is 1 week and 2 days. Wait, no. Wait, February 26th is a Tuesday. Then March 1st is 26 + 1 = 27 days after February 26th? Wait, no. Wait, if February 26th is a Tuesday, then March 1st is 26 + 1 = 27 days later? Wait, no. Wait, if February 26th is day X, then March 1st is day X + 26 days? Wait, no. Wait, if February 26th is a Tuesday, then March 1st is 26 days later. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, if February 26th is a Tuesday, then March 1st is 26 days later. Wait, but that's 26 days. Wait, 26 days is 3 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Tuesday would be Sunday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous conclusion. So maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try again. Let's start from January 1st as Tuesday. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 8 is Tuesday (7 days later). January 15 is Tuesday, 22, 29. Then February 5th is Tuesday (since January 29 is Tuesday, adding 7 days is February 5th). Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. So February 26th is a Tuesday. Then March 5th is 26 + 7 = 33 days later? Wait, no. Wait, February 26th is Tuesday. Then March 1st is 26 + 1 = 27 days later? Wait, no. Wait, from February 26th to March 1st is 5 days (February 26, 27, 28, 29, March 1). Wait, but if February has 28 days, then February 26th is 26 days into February. So March 1st is 28 - 26 = 2 days after February 26th. Wait, no. Wait, if February 26th is day X, then February 27th is X+1, February 28th is X+2, and March 1st is X+3. So March 1st is 3 days after February 26th. So if February 26th is a Tuesday, then March 1st is Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. Then March 5th is 4 days after March 1st, so Friday + 4 days is Tuesday. Wait, March 5th is Tuesday. Then March 12th is Tuesday, March 19th is Tuesday, March 26th is Tuesday. So that would mean March 26th is a Tuesday. So that matches the previous conclusion. So that seems correct. So the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought that March 1st would be 26 days later, but that's not correct. The correct way is to count the days between February 26th and March 1st. Since February has 28 days, February 26th is 26 days into February. So March 1st is 28 - 26 = 2 days later in February, so March 1st is 2 days after February 26th. So if February 26th is Tuesday, then March 1st is Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday. Wait, wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, now I'm confused again. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's take a concrete example. Let's say February 26th is a Tuesday. Then February 27th is Wednesday, February 28th is Thursday. Then March 1st is Friday. So that's 3 days later. So March 1st is Friday. Then March 5th is Friday + 4 days = Tuesday. So March 5th is Tuesday. Then March 12th is Tuesday, March 19th is Tuesday, March 26th is Tuesday. So that's correct. So March 26th is Tuesday. So that's the same as the first calculation. So why did I think earlier that March 1st is 3 days after February 26th? Because from February 26th to March 1st is 5 days (26, 27, 28, 29, 1). Wait, but if February has 28 days, then February 26th is the 26th day of February. Then February 27th is 27th, 28th is 28th. Then March 1st is the next day. So that's 3 days after February 26th. So March 1st is Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. So that's correct. So March 1st is Friday. Then March 5th is Friday + 4 days = Tuesday. So March 5th is Tuesday. Then March 12th is Tuesday, March 19th is Tuesday, March 26th is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, March 26th is a Tuesday. So the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, the initial calculation said that 84 days later is the same day of the week. So 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks. So that's correct. So that's another way to get the same answer. So both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [99, "How many Wednesdays are there from Friday, December 2, 2022 to Wednesday, December 7, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

If December 2 is a Friday, then adding days:\n\n- 2: Friday\n- 3: Saturday\n- 4: Sunday\n- 5: Monday\n- 6: Tuesday\n- 7: Wednesday\n\nYes, that's correct. So only December 7 is a Wednesday.

Today is Thursday, February 3, 2022. I need to find out what day of the week it will be 84 days from today. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 84 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 84 divided by 7 is exactly 12. So that means 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 12 weeks to Thursday would still be Thursday, right? Because each week cycles every 7 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, the problem says today is February 3, 2022. Let me confirm if 2022 is a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also by 400. 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, so not a leap year. So February has 28 days. But since we're adding 84 days, maybe the exact date isn't necessary? Because the question is only about the day of the week, not the actual date. So even if the date changes, the day of the week would be the same as adding multiples of 7 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify. Let's think: if today is Thursday, then adding 7 days is Thursday again. So 84 days is 12 times 7 days. So 12 weeks later would still be Thursday. Therefore, the answer should be Thursday. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the days step by step. Let's start from February 3, 2022. Let's add days one by one, but that would take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days and then take modulo 7. Since 84 divided by 7 is 12 with remainder 0. So 84 days later is 0 days ahead in the week. So the day of the week remains the same. Therefore, Thursday.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check with a different approach. Let's take a smaller number of days. For example, if today is Thursday, then 7 days later is Thursday. 14 days later is also Thursday. So 84 days is 12*7, so same day. Therefore, the answer is Thursday. I think that's correct. So the final answer should be Thursday.", "Thursday"], [99, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Monday, October 3, 2022 to Tuesday, October 25, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

Then subtract the weekends.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. October 3, 2022 is a Monday. October 25, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to calculate it.\n\nFrom October 3 (Monday) to October 25 (Tuesday). Let's count the days. Let's see, October 3 is day 1. Then October 4 is Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, and so on. Wait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the total days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of weeks and the extra days. Let's see. From October 3 to October 25 inclusive. Let's calculate the total days first.\n\nOctober 3 to October 25: 25 - 3 + 1 = 23 days. Wait, because inclusive. So 23 days total.\n\nNow, out of these 23 days, how many are weekends? Let's see. The first day is Monday, October 3. Then the next days: October 4 is Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, etc.\n\nSo the weekends in this period would be the Saturdays and Sundays. Let's list them:\n\nStarting from October 3 (Monday):\n\nWeek 1: 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri), 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun).

So the last day is October 25, which is Tuesday. So the last week's weekends would be 22 (Saturday) and 23 (Sunday). But October 25 is Tuesday, so the 23rd is Sunday, which is within the range. Wait, but the end date is October 25, which is Tuesday. So the 23rd is Sunday, which is included in the 23 days. So the weekends in the period are 8,9,15,16,22,23. That's 6 weekend days.\n\nSo total days: 23. Subtract 6 weekends. 23 - 6 = 17 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again.

So the 23rd is October 25? Wait, no. Wait, October 3 is day 1. Then October 4 is day 2, and so on. So October 25 is day 23. Let me check that. 25 - 3 = 22 days, plus 1 is 23.

I need to find out how many business days there are from Thursday, February 10, 2022, to Saturday, March 12, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. February 10, 2022 is a Thursday. Let's confirm that. Wait, I think I remember that February 10, 2022 was a Thursday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I should just go with that for now.\n\nSo the start date is Thursday, February 10. The end date is Saturday, March 12. Let's figure out how many days are in between.\n\nFirst, let's count the days from February 10 to February 28, 2022. Since February 2022 has 28 days (it's not a leap year), right? 2022 is not divisible by 4, so February has 28 days. So from February 10 to February 28 inclusive, how many days?\n\nFrom February 10 to February 28: 28 - 10 = 18 days, but since both start and end are inclusive, it's 18 + 1 = 19 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have two dates, the number of days between them inclusive is (end - start) + 1. So if I take February 10 as day 0, then February 11 is day 1, etc. So from February 10 to February 28 is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. But wait, that's if you include both dates. So that's 19 days in total for February.\n\nBut now, I need to check how many of those are business days. Let's break it down week by week.\n\nStarting from February 10 (Thursday). Let's list the days:\n\nFebruary 10: Thursday (business day)\nFebruary 11: Friday (business)\nFebruary 12: Saturday (non-business)\nFebruary 13: Sunday (non-business)\nFebruary 14: Monday (business)\nFebruary 15: Tuesday (business)\nFebruary 16: Wednesday (business)\nFebruary 17: Thursday (business)\nFebruary 18: Friday (business)\nFebruary 19: Saturday (non)\nFebruary 20: Sunday (non)\nFebruary 21: Monday (business)\nFebruary 22: Tuesday (business)\nFebruary 23: Wednesday (business)\nFebruary 24: Thursday (business)\nFebruary 25: Friday (business)\nFebruary 26: Saturday (non)\nFebruary 27: Sunday (non)\nFebruary 28: Monday (business)\n\nSo from February 10 to February 28, how many business days? Let's count:\n\nFrom Feb 10 to Feb 13: 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun). So 2 business days (Thu and Fri).\n\nThen Feb 14-17: 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu). 4 business days.\n\nFeb 18-21: 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon). 2 business days (Fri and Mon).\n\nFeb 22-25: 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri). 4 business days.\n\nFeb 26-28: 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon). 1 business day (Mon).\n\nAdding those up: 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 13 business days in February.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because from Feb 10 to Feb 28 is 19 days. Let me count the business days in that period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days and subtract the weekends. Let's see. From Feb 10 to Feb 28 is 19 days. How many weekends are in there?\n\nWeekends are Saturday and Sunday. Let's count how many Saturdays and Sundays are in that period.\n\nStarting from Feb 10 (Thu), the first weekend is Feb 12 (Sat) and 13 (Sun). Then next weekend is Feb 19 (Sat) and 20 (Sun). Then next is Feb 26 (Sat) and 27 (Sun). Then the next weekend would be March 4 and 5, but that's beyond February 28. So in February, there are three weekends: 12-13, 19-20, 26-27. That's 3 weekends, each with 2 days, so 6 days. So total weekends in February are 6 days. So business days would be 19 total days minus 6 weekend days = 13 business days. That matches the previous count. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to March. The end date is March 12, which is a Saturday. So March 12 is included. So we need to count the business days from March 1 (which is a Wednesday, since February 28 is a Monday, so March 1 is Tuesday? Wait, wait. Wait, February 28 is a Monday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. Wait, but earlier I thought that February 28 was a Monday. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, February 10 is Thursday. Let's count the days from Feb 10 to Feb 28. Let's see:\n\nFeb 10: Thu\n\nFeb 11: Fri\n\nFeb 12: Sat\n\nFeb 13: Sun\n\nFeb 14: Mon\n\nFeb 15: Tue\n\nFeb 16: Wed\n\nFeb 17: Thu\n\nFeb 18: Fri\n\nFeb 19: Sat\n\nFeb 20: Sun\n\nFeb 21: Mon\n\nFeb 22: Tue\n\nFeb 23: Wed\n\nFeb 24: Thu\n\nFeb 25: Fri\n\nFeb 26: Sat\n\nFeb 27: Sun\n\nFeb 28: Mon\n\nYes, so February 28 is a Monday. Therefore, March 1 is a Tuesday. So March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 2 is Wednesday, March 3 is Thursday, March 4 is Friday, March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday, March 7 is Monday, etc.\n\nSo the period from March 1 to March 12 includes March 1 (Tue) to March 12 (Sat). Let's count the business days in March from March 1 to March 12 inclusive.\n\nFirst, let's list the days:\n\nMarch 1: Tuesday (business)\nMarch 2: Wednesday (business)\nMarch 3: Thursday (business)\nMarch 4: Friday (business)\nMarch 5: Saturday (non)\nMarch 6: Sunday (non)\nMarch 7: Monday (business)\nMarch 8: Tuesday (business)\nMarch 9: Wednesday (business)\nMarch 10: Thursday (business)\nMarch 11: Friday (business)\nMarch 12: Saturday (non)\n\nSo from March 1 to March 12, inclusive, how many business days?\n\nLet's count them:\n\nMarch 1-4: 4 business days (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n\nMarch 5-6: 0 business days (Sat, Sun)\n\nMarch 7-11: 5 business days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\n\nMarch 12: non-business.\n\nSo total business days in March: 4 + 5 = 9.\n\nWait, but March 12 is included, but it's a Saturday, so not counted. So total is 4 + 5 = 9.\n\nAlternatively, total days from March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. How many weekends? March 5-6 (2 days), March 12 is Saturday, but March 12 is the end date. Wait, March 5-6 is two days, and March 12 is one day. So total weekends are 2 + 1 = 3 days. So business days would be 12 - 3 = 9. Correct.\n\nSo total business days in March from March 1 to March 12 is 9.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is from February 10 to March 12 inclusive. So the February part is 13 business days, and March part is 9 business days. So total is 13 + 9 = 22?\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the March part is from March 1 to March 12. But the original start date is February 10, which is included. So the total is February 10 to February 28 (13 business days) plus March 1 to March 12 (9 business days). So 13 + 9 = 22.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because March 1 is included in the March part. But the original period is from February 10 to March 12. So the February part is up to February 28, and March is from March 1 to March 12. So yes, adding them together.\n\nBut wait, is there any overlap? No, because February 28 is the last day of February, and March 1 is the first day of March. So adding them is correct.\n\nSo total business days would be 13 + 9 = 22.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me count the days again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days between the two dates and subtract the weekends. Let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days from February 10 to March 12 inclusive.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from February 10 to February 28 is 19 days (as calculated before). Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total days is 19 + 12 = 31 days.\n\nNow, how many weekends are in those 31 days?\n\nWe need to count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in that period.\n\nFrom February 10 to March 12.\n\nFebruary 10 is a Thursday. Let's list the weekends in that period.\n\nFirst, the weekends in February:\n\nFebruary 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun)\n\nFebruary 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun)\n\nFebruary 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun)\n\nThen March 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun)\n\nMarch 11 (Sat), 12 (Sun)\n\nWait, March 12 is Saturday, which is included in the period. So the weekends in the entire period are:\n\nFebruary 12,13; 19,20; 26,27; March 4,5; March 11,12. That's 6 weekends in February and 3 in March? Wait, March 4-5, 11-12. So that's 2 weekends in March. Wait, March 4 is Saturday, 5 Sunday. March 11 is Saturday, 12 is Sunday. So that's 4 days. So total weekends in the entire period is 6 (February) + 4 (March) = 10 days.\n\nSo total days is 31. Subtract 10 weekend days: 31 - 10 = 21 business days. Wait, but earlier I had 22. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So which approach is right?\n\nLet me check again. The first approach said 13 in February and 9 in March, total 22. The second approach says 31 total days minus 10 weekends is 21. So which is correct?\n\nLet me check the weekends again. Let's list all the weekends between Feb 10 and March 12 inclusive.\n\nFebruary 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun)\n\nFebruary 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun)\n\nFebruary 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun)\n\nMarch 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun)\n\nMarch 11 (Sat), 12 (Sun)\n\nThat's 6 weekends in February (each weekend is two days) and 2 weekends in March (each weekend is two days). Wait, March 4-5 is one weekend, March 11-12 is another. So that's 2 weekends in March, which is 4 days. So total weekends are 6 + 4 = 10 days. So 31 total days minus 10 weekends is 21 business days. But according to the first method, it was 13 + 9 = 22. So there's a conflict here. Which is correct?\n\nLet me check the first method again. In February, from Feb 10 to Feb 28, there are 13 business days. Then March 1 to March 12 has 9 business days. So 13 + 9 = 22. But according to the second method, it's 21. So where is the mistake?\n\nLet me recount the business days in February. Let's list all the days from Feb 10 to Feb 28, and count the business days.\n\nFeb 10: Thu (business)\nFeb 11: Fri (business)\nFeb 12: Sat (non)\nFeb 13: Sun (non)\nFeb 14: Mon (business)\nFeb 15: Tue (business)\nFeb 16: Wed (business)\nFeb 17: Thu (business)\nFeb 18: Fri (business)\nFeb 19: Sat (non)\nFeb 20: Sun (non)\nFeb 21: Mon (business)\nFeb 22: Tue (business)\nFeb 23: Wed (business)\nFeb 24: Thu (business)\nFeb 25: Fri (business)\nFeb 26: Sat (non)\nFeb 27: Sun (non)\nFeb 28: Mon (business)\n\nNow, let's count them:\n\nFrom Feb 10 to Feb 13: 2 business days (Thu, Fri)\nFeb 14-17: 4 business days (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu)\nFeb 18-21: 2 business days (Fri, Mon)\nFeb 22-25: 4 business days (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri)\nFeb 26-28: 1 business day (Mon)\n\nTotal: 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 13. That's correct.\n\nNow March 1 to March 12:\n\nMarch 1: Tue (business)\nMarch 2: Wed (business)\nMarch 3: Thu (business)\nMarch 4: Fri (business)\nMarch 5: Sat (non)\nMarch 6: Sun (non)\nMarch 7: Mon (business)\nMarch 8: Tue (business)\nMarch 9: Wed (business)\nMarch 10: Thu (business)\nMarch 11: Fri (business)\nMarch 12: Sat (non)\n\nSo business days are March 1-4 (4 days), March 7-11 (5 days). Total 9. So 13 + 9 = 22.\n\nBut according to the total days approach, it's 31 days minus 10 weekends = 21. So why the difference?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 31. Let me check that again. From Feb 10 to March 12 inclusive.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from Feb 10 to Feb 28 is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total is 19 + 12 = 31 days. That's correct.\n\nBut according to the weekends count, there are 10 weekend days. So 31 - 10 = 21. But according to the per-month count, it's 22. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check the weekends again. Let's list all the weekend days between Feb 10 and March 12 inclusive.\n\nFebruary 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun)\n\nFebruary 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun)\n\nFebruary 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun)\n\nMarch 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun)\n\nMarch 11 (Sat), 12 (Sun)\n\nThat's 6 Saturdays and 6 Sundays? Wait, no. Let's count:\n\nFebruary 12, 13: 2 days (Sat, Sun)\n\nFebruary 19, 20: 2 days (Sat, Sun)\n\nFebruary 26, 27: 2 days (Sat, Sun)\n\nMarch 4, 5: 2 days (Sat, Sun)\n\nMarch 11, 12: 2 days (Sat, Sun)\n\nTotal of 6 weekends, each with 2 days, so 12 days. Wait, that's 12 days. But earlier I thought it was 10. Wait, this is the mistake! Earlier I thought that March 4-5 and March 11-12 are 4 days, but that's 2 weekends (each 2 days), so 4 days. But in February, there are 3 weekends (each 2 days), so 6 days. So total weekends are 6 + 4 = 10 days. Wait, but according to the list above, there are 6 weekends (each 2 days) in February (3 weekends) and 2 weekends (each 2 days) in March (2 weekends), totaling 3 + 2 = 5 weekends"], [99, "Name the day of the week for 01/17/2022.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a known reference.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I should use a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, but how does that help me? Let me think. If I can find a date that I know the weekday for, and then count the days between that date and January 17, 2022, I can figure out the weekday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. If I recall, 2022 started on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then January 17 would be 16 days later. Since 7 days is a week, 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Sunday would be Tuesday. Wait, so January 17, 2022 would be a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday, January 15 is Sunday, and January 16 is Monday, so January 17 would be Tuesday. That seems right. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should cross-verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check an online source. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can rely on my memory. I think that's correct. So if January 1 is Sunday, then adding 16 days would be 2 weeks (14 days) and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Therefore, January 17, 2022 was a Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [99, "Count the occurrences of Thursday from Monday, December 26 to Friday, December 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week each of these dates falls on. \n\nWait, the start date is Monday, December 26. So that's a Monday. Then the next day, December 27 is Tuesday, 28 is Wednesday, 29 is Thursday, and 30 is Friday. So the dates in question are from Monday (26th) to Friday (30th). \n\nNow, let's list out each day and check if it's a Thursday. \n\nDecember 26: Monday \u2013 not Thursday. \nDecember 27: Tuesday \u2013 no. \nDecember 28: Wednesday \u2013 no. \nDecember 29: Thursday \u2013 yes, that's one. \nDecember 30: Friday \u2013 no. \n\nSo only December 29 is a Thursday. Wait, but wait, maybe I should double-check the days. Let me confirm the actual days for 2022. \n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check. If December 26 is a Monday, then December 27 is Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. So yes, that's correct. So only one Thursday in that period. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify the actual calendar for 2022. Let me think. For example, I know that December 26, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, if I know that December 26 is a Monday, then the next Thursday would be the 29th. So that's one occurrence. Then the next Thursday would be the 5th of January 2023, which is outside the range. So between the 26th and 30th, only the 29th is a Thursday. \n\nTherefore, the total number of Thursdays is 1.", "1"], [99, "In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. And I need to answer with the complete weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st (Wednesday) and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. Since January 1st is a Wednesday, January 1st is day 0. Then, January 2nd is day 1, and so on. But maybe it's easier to count the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd, inclusive or exclusive? Wait, the question is about April 3rd, so I need to count how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd, then find the weekday.\n\nWait, but if January 1st is Wednesday, then each subsequent day increments the weekday. So, for example, January 2nd is Thursday, January 3rd is Friday, etc. But since there are 31 days in January, I need to calculate how many days are in each month up to April 3rd.\n\nLet me list the months:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 or 29 days. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. But since the problem doesn't mention a leap year, maybe we can assume it's not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that doesn't depend on that. Wait, but if the year is not a leap year, then February has 28 days. However, if it's a leap year, February has 29. But the problem doesn't specify. Wait, but the problem says \"in a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So maybe the year is not a leap year? Or maybe it's a leap year? Hmm. Wait, but the problem is solvable regardless of leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but if the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we need to assume it's not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same either way. Wait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem is in a year where January 1st is a Wednesday. So, if that's the case, then the year could be a leap year or not. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we need to assume that it's not a leap year. But maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is the same regardless. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days. Then March has 31 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93 days. Wait, but that's if we include all the days up to April 3rd. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd is 93 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, etc. But the problem says that January 1st is Wednesday. So if I want to find the day of the week for April 3rd, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd, then take that number modulo 7, and add it to Wednesday.\n\nWait, but the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is (31 - 1) days in January (since January 1st is day 0?), or maybe I need to count the days from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd, and then subtract 1 if I'm counting the days between them. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1st is day 0 (Wednesday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Thursday), and so on. So the day of the week for any date can be found by taking the number of days since January 1st, then mod 7. For example, if there are 0 days since January 1st, it's Wednesday. 1 day later is Thursday, 2 days later is Friday, etc. So if I can find the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd, then take that number mod 7, and add it to Wednesday, that would give the weekday.\n\nSo let's calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days. Then March has 31 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93. So 93 days. Wait, but that's the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, etc. But if I count from January 1st to April 3rd, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 93 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 92 days? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, if January 1st is day 0 (Wednesday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Thursday), and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is (April 3rd - January 1st) days. So how many days is that?\n\nLet me calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's do it step by step:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year), March has 31 days, and April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93. So that's 93 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then April 3rd is day 92? Wait, no. Because if you have 31 days in January, then January 1st is day 0, January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31. So February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59, March 31st is day 59 + 30 = day 89. Then April 1st is day 90, April 2nd is day 91, April 3rd is day 92. So the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd is 92 days. Wait, that's different from the previous calculation. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if January 1st is day 0, then the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 92 days. Because April 3rd is 92 days after January 1st. So that would mean that the day of the week is (0 + 92) mod 7. Let's compute 92 divided by 7. 7*13 is 91, so 92 is 13*7 + 1. So 92 mod 7 is 1. So adding 1 day to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday. So April 3rd would be a Thursday?\n\nBut wait, that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought it was 93 days. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd, not including January 1st. Wait, but if you count the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive, that's 93 days. But if you count the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd, not including January 1st, then it's 92 days. So the confusion is whether the number of days is inclusive or exclusive.\n\nBut in terms of the day of the week, if January 1st is day 0 (Wednesday), then each day after that adds 1. So April 3rd is 92 days after January 1st. Therefore, the day of the week is (0 + 92) mod 7. Let's compute 92 divided by 7. 7*13 is 91, so 92 is 13*7 + 1. So 92 mod 7 is 1. So adding 1 day to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday. So April 3rd would be a Thursday.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 8th is also Wednesday (7 days later). So January 8th is Wednesday. Then January 15th, 22nd, 29th are also Wednesdays. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th, April 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th.\n\nWait, so April 2nd is a Wednesday. Then April 3rd is the next day, which is Thursday. So that would mean April 3rd is Thursday. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is Thursday.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If January 1st is Wednesday, then January 29th is also Wednesday (since 28 days later is 4 weeks). Then January 29th is Wednesday. Then January 30th is Thursday, January 31st is Friday. February 1st is Saturday. Then February 2nd is Sunday, 3rd is Monday, 4th is Tuesday, 5th is Wednesday. So February 5th is Wednesday. Then March 5th is Wednesday again. March 12th, 19th, 26th. April 2nd is Wednesday. Then April 3rd is Thursday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Thursday.", "Thursday"], [99, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 10 to Tuesday, June 14, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to calculate the total days and then subtract the weekends. Let me check the dates first. \n\nApril 10, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. April 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So April 1 is Saturday, April 2 is Sunday, April 3 is Monday, and so on. So April 10 would be 9 days after April 1.

Wait, but according to my previous calculation, April 10 is a Monday. That's a contradiction. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual day of the week for April 10, 2022. Let me think. Let's take a known date. For example, April 1, 2022 was a Friday? Wait, no. Wait, I think I need to correct this. Let me recall that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, let's count the days step by step. But this might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 10, 2022 is a Sunday. Wait, but according to my previous calculation, if April 1 is Saturday, then April 10 is Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check. Let's think about the days. For example, if April 1 is Friday, then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday, April 4 is Monday, and so on. Then April 10 would be 9 days later. Let's count:\n\nApril 1: Friday\nApril 2: Saturday\nApril 3: Sunday\nApril 4: Monday\nApril 5: Tuesday\nApril 6: Wednesday\nApril 7: Thursday\nApril 8: Friday\nApril 9: Saturday\nApril 10: Sunday\n\nAh, that's correct. So April 10 is a Sunday. Therefore, my initial assumption that April 1 was a Saturday was wrong. So April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Therefore, April 10 is a Sunday. That makes sense. So the start date is Sunday, April 10, 2022. Then the end date is Tuesday, June 14, 2022. \n\nNow, I need to count the number of weekdays (Monday-Friday) between these two dates, inclusive. \n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days between April 10 and June 14, inclusive. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. Alternatively, count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the total days and then subtract the weekends. Let's first find the total number of days from April 10 to June 14, inclusive.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the days in April after April 10. April has 30 days. So from April 10 to April 30 is 30 - 10 = 20 days. But since April 10 is included, the number of days in April is 20 + 1 = 21 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on April 10, then the number of days from April 10 to April 30 inclusive is 30 - 10 + 1 = 21 days. Then May has 31 days, and June 14 is 14 days. So total days would be 21 (April) + 31 (May) + 14 (June) = 66 days. Wait, but that's if we include both start and end dates. Wait, but let me check again. \n\nWait, April 10 to April 30: 30 - 10 + 1 = 21 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 21 + 31 = 52 days. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of days between the two dates using a different method. Let's use the fact that April 10 is day 0, then add days. But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, I can use the fact that April 10 is a Sunday, and then count the days step by step.\n\nBut perhaps I should use a different approach. Let's break it down into months. \n\nFrom April 10 to April 30: 21 days (as calculated). Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. So total days between April 10 and June 14 inclusive is 66 days. \n\nNow, I need to find how many of those 66 days are weekdays (Monday-Friday). \n\nBut since the start date is a Sunday (April 10), and the end date is a Tuesday (June 14), I need to check the days of the week for each month. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weekends in this period and subtract them from the total. \n\nSo total days: 66. \n\nNumber of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period. \n\nFirst, let's find out how many Saturdays and Sundays are there between April 10 and June 14 inclusive. \n\nStarting with April 10, which is a Sunday. So the first day is Sunday. Then the next day is Monday, and so on. \n\nLet me list the days of the week for each month. \n\nApril 10 is Sunday. April 11 is Monday, 12 Tuesday, 13 Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday, etc. \n\nSo in April, starting from April 10 (Sunday), the weekends would be Sundays and Saturdays. \n\nApril 10 is Sunday. Then the next Saturday is April 16. Then April 17 is Sunday. Then April 24 is Saturday, April 25 Sunday. Then April 31 is Saturday (since April 30 is a Friday, April 31 is Saturday? Wait, April has 30 days. So April 30 is a Friday. Then May 1 is a Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting with previous calculations. Wait, if April 10 is Sunday, then April 16 is Saturday (since April 10 is Sunday, 11 Mon, 12 Tue, 13 Wed, 14 Thu, 15 Fri, 16 Sat). Then April 17 is Sunday. Then April 24 is Saturday (17 + 7 days), April 25 Sunday. Then April 31 is 25 + 6 days (April 25 is Sunday, 26 Mon, 27 Tue, 28 Wed, 29 Thu, 30 Fri, 31 Sat). Wait, so April 31 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. \n\nSo in April, the weekends are:\n\nApril 10 (Sunday), 16 (Saturday), 17 (Sunday), 24 (Saturday), 25 (Sunday), 31 (Saturday). Wait, but April 31 is Saturday. So that's 3 Sundays (10, 17, 25) and 3 Saturdays (16, 24, 31). Wait, but April 10 is Sunday, then April 16 is Saturday, then April 17 is Sunday, April 24 is Saturday, April 25 is Sunday, April 31 is Saturday. So that's 3 Sundays and 3 Saturdays in April. So total of 6 weekend days in April. \n\nThen May has 31 days. Let's check the days of the week for May. May 1 is Sunday (since April 31 is Saturday, May 1 is Sunday). So May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, etc. \n\nSo in May, the weekends are Sundays and Saturdays. \n\nMay has 31 days. Let's find how many Saturdays and Sundays there are. \n\nMay 1 is Sunday. So the first Sunday is May 1, then May 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Sundays. \n\nSaturdays in May would be May 7, 14, 21, 28. That's 4 Saturdays. Wait, May 7 is Saturday (since May 1 is Sunday, May 7 is Saturday). Then May 14, 21, 28. So that's 4 Saturdays. So total of 5 Sundays and 4 Saturdays in May. That's 9 weekend days. \n\nThen June 1 is Monday (since May 31 is a Saturday, May 31 is Saturday, June 1 is Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, May 31 is Saturday, so June 1 is Sunday. Wait, but earlier I thought May 1 is Sunday, so May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. Then May 31 is Saturday (since May 29 is Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday? Wait, no, this is conflicting. Wait, I need to correct this. \n\nWait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday, May 7 is Saturday. Then May 8 is Sunday. So May 7 is Saturday, May 8 Sunday. Then May 14 is Saturday (May 7 + 7 days), May 15 Sunday. May 21 Saturday, May 22 Sunday. May 28 Saturday, May 29 Sunday. Then May 31 is Tuesday? Wait, May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, June 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting with previous statements. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me start over. \n\nIf April 10 is Sunday, then April 16 is Saturday (as before). April 17 is Sunday. April 24 is Saturday, April 25 Sunday. April 31 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. \n\nSo May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 Tuesday, May 4 Wednesday, May 5 Thursday, May 6 Friday, May 7 Saturday. Then May 8 is Sunday. So May 7 is Saturday, May 8 Sunday. Then May 14 is Saturday (May 7 + 7 days), May 15 Sunday. May 21 Saturday, May 22 Sunday. May 28 Saturday, May 29 Sunday. Then May 31 is Tuesday (since May 29 is Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday). Therefore, June 1 is Wednesday. \n\nSo in May, the weekends are:\n\nSaturdays: May 7, 14, 21, 28 (4 Saturdays)\nSundays: May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (5 Sundays)\nTotal of 9 weekend days in May. \n\nNow, June 1 is Wednesday. The end date is June 14, which is Tuesday. Let's check the days in June. \n\nJune 1 is Wednesday, June 2 Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday, 7 Tuesday, 8 Wednesday, 9 Thursday, 10 Friday, 11 Saturday, 12 Sunday, 13 Monday, 14 Tuesday. \n\nSo in June, the weekends are:\n\nSaturdays: June 4, 11\nSundays: June 5, 12\nSo that's 2 Saturdays and 2 Sundays, total 4 weekend days. \n\nSo total weekend days in the entire period are:\n\nApril: 3 Sundays + 3 Saturdays = 6\nMay: 5 Sundays + 4 Saturdays = 9\nJune: 2 Saturdays + 2 Sundays = 4\nTotal weekend days: 6 + 9 + 4 = 19\n\nTotal days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is 66 days. So the number of weekdays is 66 - 19 = 47. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Because if the total days are 66, and there are 19 weekend days, then 66 - 19 = 47 weekdays. \n\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Let's count the number of each weekday. \n\nStarting from April 10 (Sunday), the first day is Sunday. Then the next day is Monday, and so on. \n\nIn April, the days are:\n\nApril 10 (Sun), 11 (Mon), 12 (Tue), 13 (Wed), 14 (Thu), 15 (Fri), 16 (Sat), 17 (Sun), 18 (Mon), 19 (Tue), 20 (Wed), 21 (Thu), 22 (Fri), 23 (Sat), 24 (Sun), 25 (Mon), 26 (Tue), 27 (Wed), 28 (Thu), 29 (Fri), 30 (Sat). Wait, but April 30 is Saturday? Wait, earlier I thought April 31 was Saturday, but April only has 30 days. So April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. \n\nSo in April, the weekdays (Monday-Friday) are:\n\nApril 11 (Mon), 12 (Tue), 13 (Wed), 14 (Thu), 15 (Fri), 18 (Mon), 19 (Tue), 20 (Wed), 21 (Thu), 22 (Fri), 23 (Sat), 24 (Sun), 25 (Mon), 26 (Tue), 27 (Wed), 28 (Thu), 29 (Fri), 30 (Sat). Wait, but April 30 is Saturday. So the weekdays in April are from April 11 to April 15 (5 days), then April 18 to 22 (5 days), then April 25 to 29 (5 days). That's 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 weekdays in April. \n\nWait, but April 10 is Sunday, so April 11 is Monday. Then April 11-15 is 5 days (Mon-Fri). Then April 18-22 is another 5 days (Mon-Fri). Then April 25-29 is another 5 days (Mon-Fri). That's 15 weekdays in April. \n\nIn May, starting from May 1 (Sunday), the weekdays are:\n\nMay 2 (Mon), 3 (Tue), 4 (Wed), 5 (Thu), 6 (Fri), 8 (Sun), 9 (Mon), 10 (Tue), 11 (Wed), 12 (Thu), 13 (Fri), 15 (Sun), 16 (Mon), 17 (Tue), 18 (Wed), 19 (Thu),"], [99, "What day of the week was December 20, 2022? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to find out what day of the week December 20, 2022 was. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. If I recall, 2022 was a leap year? Wait, no, 2022 is not a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also by 400. So 2020 was a leap year, 2024 will be, but 2022 is not. So February had 28 days in 2022.\n\nBut maybe I should check a known date. For example, I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me verify that. If I check an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me think about the previous year. December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday, because 2022 ended on Saturday. Then January 1, 2023 is Sunday. So if that's correct, then I can count backwards from there.\n\nSo December 31, 2022 is Saturday. Then December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday, 25 is Sunday, 24 is Saturday, 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday, 21 is Wednesday, 20 is Tuesday. Wait, that would mean December 20, 2022 was a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if my assumption that January 1, 2023 is Sunday is correct. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. July 4, 2022. If I count from July 4, 2022, which is a Monday, then adding days. Let's see, July 4 is Monday. Then July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. Wait, but that would mean August 1, 2022 is a Monday. Then August 1 is Monday, so August 2 is Tuesday, and so on. Then December 20 would be... Let's count the days from July 4 to December 20.\n\nBut maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the fact that December 20, 2022 is 183 days after January 1, 2022. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. January 1, 2022 was a Sunday? Wait, I think that's correct. Wait, I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If that's the case, then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then December 20 would be 20 days before December 31. Let's count backwards. December 31 is Saturday. December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday, 25 is Sunday, 24 is Saturday, 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday, 21 is Wednesday, 20 is Tuesday. So that would make December 20, 2022 a Tuesday. But I need to confirm if January 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So 2022 is one year before, so if 2022 is not a leap year, then December 31, 2022 is one day before January 1, 2023. So if January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then December 31, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, December 20 would be 11 days before December 31. Wait, December 31 minus 11 days is December 20. Let me count: December 31 (Saturday), 30 (Fri), 29 (Thu), 28 (Wed), 27 (Tue), 26 (Mon), 25 (Sun), 24 (Sat), 23 (Fri), 22 (Thu), 21 (Wed), 20 (Tue). So yes, that's 11 days back. So December 20, 2022 is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [99, "Is 2014 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2014 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2014. First, divide 2014 by 4. 4 times 503 is 2012, so 2014 minus 2012 is 2. That means 2014 divided by 4 is 503.5, which isn't a whole number. So 2014 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the rules, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me add 2012 and 2016 to confirm. 2012 is a leap year, then 2016 would be the next one. So 2014 is in between, so it's not a leap year. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [99, "In a year where Sunday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 11. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the weekday of April 11th in a year where January 1st is a Sunday. So I need to figure out what day of the week April 11th falls on, given that January 1st is a Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of days between January 1st and April 11th. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, but since the question is about a specific year where January 1st is a Sunday, maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year unless told otherwise. Wait, but actually, the problem doesn't mention leap years, so maybe I should just proceed with the standard 28 days in February. Wait, but if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. However, since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should check if there's a way to determine that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no, because if it's a leap year, the number of days would change. But since the problem doesn't mention a leap year, perhaps I should assume it's a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1st (Sunday) to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then April 11th is 11 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 11th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 11 is 100 days. Wait, but wait, that's from January 1st to April 11th inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So the number of days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days? Wait, let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is day 0 (Sunday). Then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 30 + 28 = day 58. Then March has 31 days, so March 31st is day 58 + 31 = day 89. Then April 1st is day 90, April 2nd is 91, ..., April 11th is day 90 + 10 = day 100. So April 11th is 100 days after January 1st.\n\nNow, since each week has 7 days, I can divide 100 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks (14*7=98) with a remainder of 2 days. So 100 days later is 14 weeks and 2 days. Since January 1st is a Sunday, adding 14 weeks (which is 98 days) brings us back to Sunday. Then adding 2 more days: Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 days is Tuesday. Therefore, April 11th should be a Tuesday.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days. Then February is 28 days, so 30 + 28 = 58. March is 31 days, so 58 + 31 = 89. Then April 11th is 11 days into April, so 89 + 11 = 100. Yes, that's correct. So 100 days total. 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 2 days after Sunday is Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step for each month. Let's start with January 1st as Sunday.\n\nJanuary 1st: Sunday (day 0)\nJanuary 8th: Sunday (day 7)\nJanuary 15th: Sunday (day 14)\nJanuary 22nd: Sunday (day 21)\nJanuary 29th: Sunday (day 28)\nFebruary 5th: Sunday (day 35)\nFebruary 12th: Sunday (day 42)\nFebruary 19th: Sunday (day 49)\nFebruary 26th: Sunday (day 56)\nMarch 5th: Sunday (day 63)\nMarch 12th: Sunday (day 70)\nMarch 19th: Sunday (day 77)\nMarch 26th: Sunday (day 84)\nApril 2nd: Sunday (day 91)\nApril 9th: Sunday (day 98)\nApril 16th: Sunday (day 105)\n\nWait, so April 2nd is Sunday (day 91). Then April 9th is Sunday (day 98). Then April 16th is Sunday (day 105). So April 11th is 5 days before April 16th. April 16th is Sunday, so April 11th would be 5 days earlier. Let's count backwards: April 16th (Sunday) minus 1 day is Friday (15th), minus 2 days is Thursday (14th), minus 3 days is Wednesday (13th), minus 4 days is Tuesday (12th), minus 5 days is Monday (11th). Wait, that's conflicting with the previous answer. Wait, this suggests that April 11th is a Monday. But earlier calculation said Tuesday. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 11th again. Maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the second method. Let's check the second method again. If April 2nd is Sunday (day 91), then April 9th is Sunday (day 98). Then April 16th is Sunday (day 105). So April 11th is 5 days before April 16th. So April 16th is Sunday. April 15th is Saturday, 14th is Friday, 13th is Thursday, 12th is Wednesday, 11th is Tuesday. Wait, that's different from my previous count. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the previous step. Let me recount:\n\nIf April 16th is Sunday, then:\n\nApril 16th: Sunday\n\nApril 15th: Saturday\n\nApril 14th: Friday\n\nApril 13th: Thursday\n\nApril 12th: Wednesday\n\nApril 11th: Tuesday\n\nSo that would mean April 11th is Tuesday. But earlier when I counted backwards from April 16th, I thought April 11th was Monday. That was a mistake. So the correct answer is Tuesday. So the first calculation was correct. The second method also leads to Tuesday. So the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought April 11th was 5 days before April 16th, but when I counted backwards, I must have miscalculated. So the correct answer is Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the weekday of April 11th is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [99, "Between Tuesday, January 25, 2022 and Tuesday, March 29, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, January 25, 2022, and Tuesday, March 29, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me check the dates. January 25 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think January 25, 2022 was a Tuesday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can count the days or use a calendar. But since I can't look it up, I'll proceed with the given information.\n\nSo the period starts on Tuesday, January 25, 2022, and ends on Tuesday, March 29, 2022. Let me calculate the total number of days between these two dates.\n\nFirst, let's break it down into months. January has 31 days. So from January 25 to January 31 is 31 - 25 = 6 days. Then February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. Then March has 31 days, but we only go up to March 29.\n\nSo total days would be:\n\nJanuary: 31 - 25 + 1 = 7 days (including both start and end dates of January). Wait, wait. Wait, the start date is January 25, so from January 25 to January 31 inclusive is 7 days. Then February has 28 days, and March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days would be 7 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 29 (Mar) = 64 days total?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nFrom January 25 to January 31: that's 7 days (25,26,27,28,29,30,31). Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days is 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 64 days.\n\nNow, out of these 64 days, how many are weekends? Let's figure out how many Saturdays and Sundays there are.\n\nSince the start date is a Tuesday, January 25, 2022. Let's see the days of the week for each month.\n\nJanuary 25 is Tuesday. Then January 26 is Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So in January, the weekends are 29 (Saturday) and 30 (Sunday). That's 2 weekend days in January.\n\nThen February 2022 starts on a Wednesday (since January 31 is a Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday? Wait, wait. Wait, January 31 is a Monday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean that February 1 is a Tuesday. Wait, but if January 25 is Tuesday, then January 26 is Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then February has 28 days. Let's count the weekends in February.\n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. So the weekends in February would be the Saturdays and Sundays. Let's see:\n\nFebruary 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue)... So every 7 days. So in February, the first weekend is 5 (Sat) and 6 (Sun). Then 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Wait, February has 28 days. So the last day is February 28, which is a Monday. So the weekends in February are 5,6,12,13,19,20,26,27. That's 8 weekend days in February.\n\nThen March 1 is a Tuesday (since February 28 is a Monday, March 1 is Tuesday). March 1 is Tuesday, so March 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, etc. The period ends on March 29, which is a Tuesday. Let's check the weekends in March.\n\nMarch 1 is Tuesday. So the weekends in March would be 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Then March 29 is a Tuesday. So the last weekend in March would be March 26 and 27. So that's 8 weekend days in March as well? Wait, March 29 is the end date, which is a Tuesday. So March 26 is Saturday, 27 Sunday. Then March 28 is Monday, 29 Tuesday. So in March, the weekends are 5,6,12,13,19,20,26,27. That's 8 days. So March has 8 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekend days: January 2 + February 8 + March 8 = 18 days.\n\nSo total business days would be total days (64) minus weekend days (18) = 46 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks in the period. Since the total days are 64, that's 9 weeks and 1 day (since 7*9=63, so 64 is 9 weeks and 1 day). But since the start and end dates are both Tuesdays, maybe the number of weeks is 9 weeks and 1 day. But that might not be accurate. Wait, 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day. But if the first day is Tuesday, then the 64th day would be Tuesday again. Because 7*9=63 days later would be the same day of the week. So adding one day would make it Tuesday again. So that's correct.\n\nIn 9 weeks, there are 9*5=45 business days. Then the extra day is Tuesday, which is a business day. So total business days would be 45 +1 = 46. That matches the previous calculation. So that's 46.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because maybe the initial calculation of total days is wrong. Let me check the total days again.\n\nFrom January 25 to January 31 inclusive: 7 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So 7+28+29=64. That's correct. So 64 days total.\n\nSo 64 days. If there are 9 weeks and 1 day, then 9 weeks is 63 days. So 63 days would be 9*5=45 business days. Then the remaining 1 day is Tuesday, which is a business day. So 45+1=46. So that's 46 business days. So the answer should be 46.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the weekend count. Let me check again. January had 2 weekend days, February 8, March 8. Total 18. 64-18=46. So that's the same. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates. Let me try to count the weekends again.\n\nJanuary 25 is Tuesday. So the first weekend in January is January 29 (Saturday) and 30 (Sunday). That's 2 days. Then in February, as February 1 is Tuesday, the first weekend is 5 (Saturday) and 6 (Sunday). Then 12,13,19,20,26,27. That's 6 weekends in February? Wait, 5,6,12,13,19,20,26,27. That's 8 days. So 8 days. Then March 5,6,12,13,19,20,26,27. That's 8 days. So total 2+8+8=18. So 64-18=46. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of business days is 46.", "46"], [99, "If a meeting is scheduled on the last Saturday of December 2022, on which day of the month does it occur?

The question is asking for the date of the last Saturday in December 2022. I need to figure out which Saturday that is. First, I should check what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then counting the days:\n\nDecember 1: Thursday\nDecember 2: Friday\nDecember 3: Saturday.

So the last Saturday would be the 31st? But wait, let me check again. If December 3 is a Saturday, then adding 7 days each time: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. So the 31st is a Saturday. But wait, does December 2022 actually have a 31st? Yes, December has 31 days. So the last Saturday would be the 31st. But wait, I need to make sure that December 31, 2022, was indeed a Saturday.

Write out the full weekday name.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week November 15, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to go back to 2022. Let me check. Wait, maybe I should use a reference date that I know. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, no, maybe I should check another date. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I can figure out how many days are between November 15, 2022 and January 1, 2023, I can count backward.\n\nBut maybe that's complicated. Alternatively, I can use the fact that November 15, 2022 is a certain number of days from a known date. Let me think. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that October 15, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, I think that's right. Let me think. If I can find a date that I know, then I can count the days between that date and November 15, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 15, 2022 is the same as November 15, 2023, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I should use the fact that November 15, 2022 is 15 days into November. Let me think about the days in November. November has 30 days. So November 15 is the 15th day of the month. But how does that help me?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if I know the day of the week for a certain date, I can add or subtract days to find others. For example, if I know that November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday, then I can check if that's correct. Wait, but I need to figure it out.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I can find out how many days are between November 15, 2022 and January 1, 2023, then I can subtract that number from Sunday to find the day of the week for November 15.\n\nLet me calculate the days between November 15, 2022 and January 1, 2023. November has 30 days, so from November 15 to November 30 is 15 days (since 30 - 15 = 15). Then December has 31 days. So total days from November 15 to December 31 is 15 + 31 = 46 days. Then January 1 is the next day. So total days from November 15 to January 1 is 46 days. Wait, but that would mean that November 15 is 46 days before January 1, 2023. Since January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then November 15, 2022 would be 46 days earlier. \n\nNow, since each week has 7 days, I can divide 46 by 7 to find the number of weeks and remaining days. 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks (42 days) with a remainder of 4 days. So 46 days before Sunday would be 4 days before Sunday. Let's count backward: Sunday minus 1 day is Saturday, minus 2 is Friday, minus 3 is Thursday, minus 4 is Wednesday. So November 15, 2022 would be a Wednesday? Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If December 21 is a Wednesday, then November 15 is 16 days earlier (since December 21 minus November 15 is 16 days). Wait, November has 30 days, so November 15 to November 30 is 15 days, then December 1 to December 21 is 21 days. So total from November 15 to December 21 is 15 + 21 = 36 days. Wait, that's not right. Wait, November 15 to November 30 is 15 days (since 30 - 15 = 15). Then December 1 to December 21 is 21 days. So total is 15 + 21 = 36 days. So if December 21 is a Wednesday, then November 15 is 36 days before that. 36 divided by 7 is 5 weeks (35 days) and 1 day. So 36 days before Wednesday would be 1 day before Wednesday, which is Tuesday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. So which one is correct?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then November 15, 2022 is 46 days before that. 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 4 days. So 46 days before Sunday is 4 days before Sunday. So Sunday minus 4 days is Wednesday. But according to the other method, if December 21 is Wednesday, then November 15 is 36 days before, which is 1 day before Wednesday, which is Tuesday. These two results are conflicting. So I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the assumption that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Let me check that. I think that January 1, 2023 was actually a Sunday. Let me confirm. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, I think I need to check the actual days. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. So if I can count the days from July 4 to November 15, 2022, then I can find the day of the week.\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (31 - 4 = 27). Then August has 31 days, September has 30, October has 31, and November 15 is the 15th day of November. So total days from July 4 to November 15 is 27 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 15 (November) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 15 is 134 days. So 134 days from July 4, 2022 (Monday) to November 15, 2022. Now, 134 divided by 7 is 19 weeks and 1 day. So 19 weeks is 133 days, so 134 days is 19 weeks and 1 day. Therefore, November 15, 2022 would be 1 day after Monday, which is Tuesday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. So now I'm confused again.\n\nWait, but if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 134 days would be 19 weeks (133 days) plus 1 day. So 133 days later is the same day, Monday, then adding 1 day would be Tuesday. So according to this, November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday. But earlier calculations gave me Wednesday and Tuesday. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between July 4 and November 15. Let me recalculate that. July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since July 4 is day 0, July 5 is day 1, etc. So from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days). Then August has 31 days, September 30, October 31, and November 15. So total days from July 4 to November 15 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 15 is 134. That's correct. So 134 days. 134 divided by 7 is 19*7=133, remainder 1. So 134 days later is 1 day after Monday, which is Tuesday. So that would mean November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday. But earlier when I thought that December 21 was a Wednesday, and calculated that November 15 is 36 days before, which would be 36/7=5 weeks and 1 day, so 1 day before Wednesday is Tuesday. That matches. So that would mean that November 15 is a Tuesday. But earlier when I calculated from January 1, 2023 being Sunday, I thought it was Wednesday. So that must be wrong. So where is the mistake there?\n\nLet me check again. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then November 15, 2022 is 46 days before that. Let me count 46 days backward from Sunday. Let's do it step by step. 46 days before Sunday. Let's break it down into weeks. 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks (42 days) and 4 days. So 42 days before Sunday is Sunday again (since 6 weeks). Then 4 more days before Sunday would be: Sunday minus 1 day is Saturday, minus 2 is Friday, minus 3 is Thursday, minus 4 is Wednesday. So that would be Wednesday. But according to the other calculations, it's Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the assumptions is wrong.\n\nSo which one is correct? Let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. If that's correct, then November 15 is 16 days earlier (since November 15 to December 21 is 16 days). Wait, November has 30 days, so November 15 to November 30 is 15 days, then December 1 to December 21 is 21 days. So total is 15 + 21 = 36 days. Wait, that's 36 days from November 15 to December 21. So if December 21 is Wednesday, then November 15 is 36 days before that. 36 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 1 day. So 36 days before Wednesday is 1 day before Wednesday, which is Tuesday. So that would mean November 15 is Tuesday. So that's consistent with the other calculation. Therefore, the mistake must be in the assumption that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Let me check that.\n\nWait, if November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday, then January 1, 2023 would be 46 days later. Let's check that. 46 days from Tuesday. 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 4 days. So 6 weeks later is Tuesday again, then 4 days later would be Saturday. So January 1, 2023 would be a Saturday. But I thought it was a Sunday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, my assumption that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday must be wrong. So where is the error here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but according to the calculation above, if November 15 is Tuesday, then January 1 would be Saturday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, one of the calculations is wrong. Let me check another way. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's check what day of the week July 4, 2022 was. If I can confirm that, then I can use that to calculate other dates.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Let me check that. If I can find a reliable source, but since I can't, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. But according to the calculation from November 15 being Tuesday, that would mean that January 1 is Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me check that with another method. For example, if I know that November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday, then December 21, 2022 is 16 days later. 16 days later would be 2 weeks (14 days) and 2 days. So 14 days later is Tuesday again, then 2 days later is Thursday. But I thought December 21 was a Wednesday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, this suggests that November 15 is not a Tuesday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should use a different approach. Let me use the fact that I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If December 21 is Wednesday, then November 15 is 36 days earlier. 36 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 1 day. So 36 days before Wednesday is 1 day before Wednesday, which is Tuesday. So November 15 is Tuesday. Then December 21 is 36 days later. 36 days is 5 weeks and 1 day. So 5 weeks later is Tuesday, plus 1 day is Wednesday. That matches. So that's correct. Therefore, November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday. Therefore, the previous calculation where I thought January 1, 2023 was a Sunday must be wrong. So maybe January 1, 2023 is not a Sunday. Let me check that again.\n\nIf November 15, 2022 is Tuesday, then from November 15 to December 31 is 47 days (November has 30 days, so 30 - 15 = 15 days in November, then December has 31 days, so 15 + 31 = 46 days. Then January 1 is the next day, so 46 days from November 15 is December 31, 2022. Then January 1, 2023 is 1 day after December 31, which is 46 + 1 = 47 days from November 15. So 47 days from Tuesday is 47 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 5 days. So 6 weeks later is Tuesday, plus 5 days is Sunday. So January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. Wait, that matches the initial assumption. But earlier when I calculated from November 15 to January 1 as 46 days, I thought that 46 days before Sunday would be Wednesday. But now, if November 15 is Tuesday, then 46 days later is Sunday. So that's correct. So where was the mistake in the previous calculation?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the first calculation. I said that November 15 is 46 days before January 1, 2023. But if November 15 is Tuesday, then January 1 is 46 days later, which is 46 days from Tuesday. 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 4 days. So 6 weeks later is Tuesday, plus 4 days is Saturday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation where I said that 46 days from November 15 (Tuesday) would be Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. What's the error?\n\nWait, let's count the days between November 15 and January 1. November has 30 days, so from November 15 to November 30 is 15 days. Then December has 31 days. So total days from November 15 to December 31 is 15 + 31 = 46 days. Then January 1 is the next day, so the total days from November 15 to January 1 is 46 + 1 = 47 days. Wait, that's 47 days. So if November 15 is Tuesday, then January 1 is 47 days later. 4"], [99, "Determine the day of the month for the third Thursday in December 2022. Write the total number. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the day of the month for the third Thursday in December 2022. Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Thursday is the 1st. Then the second Thursday would be the 8th, and the third would be the 15th. But wait, maybe I should check again. Let me think. If December 1 is a Thursday, then adding 7 days would be the next Thursday, so 8th, then 15th, 22nd, and 29th. So the third Thursday would be the 15th. But wait, is that right? Let me count again. First Thursday is 1st, second is 8th, third is 15th. Yes, that seems correct. But I should make sure that December 2022 actually has that many Thursdays. December has 31 days, so there are four Thursdays in December. The fourth would be the 22nd, then 29th. Wait, no, if the first is 1st, then 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th. So five Thursdays? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, December has 31 days. Let me check the dates again. If December 1 is a Thursday, then the Thursdays would be 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's five Thursdays. But the question is asking for the third one. So the third would be the 15th. So the answer should be 15. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check. I think December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me verify. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, if December 1 is a Thursday, then December 21 would be 20 days later. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Thursday would be Wednesday. That matches. So that's correct.

Provide the full name of the weekday.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what day of the week it was 58 days ago, given that today is Friday, March 11, 2022. Hmm, I need to figure out how to calculate that.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 58 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks with a remainder of 2 days because 7 times 8 is 56, and 58 minus 56 is 2. So 58 days ago is the same as 8 weeks and 2 days ago. Since 8 weeks is exactly 56 days, subtracting that from 58 leaves 2 days.\n\nNow, if today is Friday, March 11, 2022, then 56 days ago would also be a Friday. Then, subtracting 2 more days from Friday. Let's count: one day before Friday is Thursday, two days before is Wednesday. So 58 days ago should be a Wednesday. Wait, but I need to make sure that the date calculation is correct. Wait, maybe I should check if March 11, 2022 is indeed a Friday. Let me confirm that. Wait, the user said today is Friday, March 11, 2022, so that's given. So I don't need to verify that. So if I go back 58 days, which is 8 weeks and 2 days, then subtracting 2 days from Friday would be Wednesday. So the answer should be Wednesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the days? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. But since we're starting from March 11, going back 58 days, I don't think that affects the calculation because we're not crossing into February. Let me check the exact dates. Let's see, March 11 minus 58 days. Let's count backwards. March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 58 days. Let's subtract 58 days step by step. March 11 minus 1 day is March 10, minus 2 days is March 9, etc. But that's tedious. Alternatively, since 58 days is 8 weeks and 2 days, subtracting 8 weeks (56 days) would take us back to March 11 minus 56 days. March 11 minus 56 days. Let's see, March has 31 days. So March 11 minus 31 days would be February 10, 2022. Then subtract another 25 days (since 56-31=25). Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the date 58 days before March 11, 2022. Let me try that. Let's count backwards. March 11 minus 58 days. Let's break it down. March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 20 days would be February 21, 2022 (since March 11 minus 11 days is February 21, then minus 9 more days is February 12? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe using a calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to rely on the week calculation. Since 58 days is 8 weeks and 2 days, then 58 days ago is 8 weeks before, which is the same day of the week, minus 2 days. So if today is Friday, then 58 days ago is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be Wednesday. I think that's correct. Let me just confirm once more. If I go back 7 days from Friday, it's still Friday. So 56 days ago is Friday. Then 57 days ago is Thursday, 58 days ago is Wednesday. Yes, that's right. So the answer is Wednesday.", "Wednesday"], [99, "Name the day of the week for 10/16/2022. Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 16, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If I recall correctly, 2022 started on a Sunday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Let me check. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me try to recall. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on a Saturday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. So that's correct.\n\nSo if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then I can count backwards to find October 16, 2022. Let's see. Let's figure out how many days are between October 16, 2022 and January 1, 2023. Wait, but maybe it's easier to count forward from October 16, 2022 to January 1, 2023. Alternatively, maybe I can find a known date in 2022 that I know the day of the week for.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. Wait, no, that's what I need to find. Wait, maybe I can check a calendar. But since I can't actually look it up, I need to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is the same as October 16, 2022. Let me think about the days in each month. Let's start from October 16, 2022. Let's count the days from that date to a known date.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. Wait, but I need to verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is the same as October 16, 2022. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAnother way is to use the fact that if I know the day of the week for a certain date, I can add or subtract days to find other dates. For example, if I know that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday, then I can check if that's correct. But I need to find it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I can find how many days are between October 16, 2022 and January 1, 2023, then I can subtract that number of days from Sunday to find the day of the week for October 16, 2022.\n\nLet me calculate the number of days between October 16, 2022 and January 1, 2023. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom October 16 to October 31: October has 31 days. So 31 - 16 = 15 days remaining in October after October 16. So that's 15 days.\n\nThen November has 30 days, December has 31 days. So from October 16 to December 31, 2022 is 15 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 76 days. Then January 1, 2023 is the next day. So total days from October 16 to January 1 is 76 days. Wait, but if October 16 is day 0, then October 17 is day 1, and so on. Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find the number of days between October 16 and January 1, inclusive or exclusive? Wait, if I want to find how many days are between October 16 and January 1, then it's 76 days. Because from October 16 to October 31 is 15 days (since October 16 is day 0, then October 17 is day 1, ..., October 31 is day 15). Then November has 30 days (days 16 to 45), December has 31 days (days 46 to 76). Then January 1 is day 77. Wait, so the number of days between October 16 and January 1 is 77 days? Wait, no. Wait, if October 16 is day 0, then October 17 is day 1, and so on. So the number of days from October 16 to January 1 is 77 days. But if I want to find the difference between the two dates, it's 77 days. So if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then October 16, 2022 would be 77 days before that. So 77 days before Sunday. Since 77 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 0 days. Wait, 7*11=77. So 77 days is exactly 11 weeks. So if January 1 is Sunday, then 77 days before that would also be a Sunday. Wait, that can't be right. Because if you go back 7 days, you get the same day of the week. So if January 1 is Sunday, then October 16 would also be Sunday? But that would mean that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. But I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days from October 16 to January 1, 2023.\n\nOctober has 31 days. So from October 16 to October 31 is 31 - 16 = 15 days. Then November has 30 days, December has 31 days. So total days from October 16 to December 31 is 15 + 30 + 31 = 76 days. Then January 1 is the next day, so that's 77 days in total. So October 16 to January 1 is 77 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then October 16 is 77 days before that. Since 77 divided by 7 is 11 weeks exactly, so 77 days is 11 weeks. Therefore, October 16 would be the same day of the week as January 1, which is Sunday. Therefore, October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. But wait, I think I might be making a mistake here. Because if you go back 7 days, you get the same day. So if January 1 is Sunday, then October 25, 2022 would also be Sunday (since 7 days before January 1 is December 25, 2022, and then 7 days before that is December 18, etc. Wait, maybe I need to check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. Wait, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can check a different approach. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 is the same as October 16, 2022. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is the same as October 16, 2022. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. Wait, but I need to find it. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if I know that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday, then I can check if that's correct. But how? Maybe I can use another method. Let's use Zeller's Congruence. Zeller's Congruence is a formula to calculate the day of the week for any Julian or Gregorian calendar date. The formula is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut note that January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. So for October 16, 2022, the month is 10, so we don't need to adjust. So:\n\nq = 16 (day)\nm = 10 (October)\nYear is 2022, so K = 22 (2022 mod 100)\nJ = 20 (floor(2022 / 100) = 20)\n\nNow plug into the formula:\n\nh = (16 + floor((13*(10 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each part step by step:\n\nFirst, floor((13*(10 + 1))/5) = floor(13*11/5) = floor(143/5) = floor(28.6) = 28\n\nThen floor(22/4) = 5 (since 22 divided by 4 is 5.5, floor is 5)\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all together:\n\n16 + 28 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 16 + 28 is 44, plus 22 is 66, plus 5 is 71, plus 5 is 76, plus 100 is 176.\n\nNow 176 mod 7. Let's divide 176 by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 176 - 175 = 1. So h = 1.\n\nAccording to Zeller's Congruence, h = 1 corresponds to Sunday (since 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday). Therefore, October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. So that's the answer.", "Sunday"], [99, "What day of the week was November 28, 2022?

If I recall, 2022 was a leap year? No, 2022 is not a leap year because 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, so it's not divisible by 4. So February had 28 days. So January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If December 31, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. But how do I know what day December 31, 2022 was?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that.

July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. August has 31 days, so August 1 is Monday, August 8 is Monday, August 15, 22, 29. Then September 1 is Monday. September has 30 days, so September 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. October 1 is Monday. October has 31 days, so October 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, November 5. November 5 is Monday. Then November 12, 19, 26. So November 26 is a Monday. Then November 27 is Tuesday, November 28 is Wednesday. Wait, that would make November 28, 2022 a Wednesday. But I need to check if my assumption that July 4, 2022 was a Monday is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check online... Wait, no, I can't access the internet. So I need to rely on my memory. Let me think again. If I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. So if December 31 is Saturday, then December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday, 28 is Wednesday, 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday. Then November 28... Let's count backwards. Let's see, December has 31 days. So November 28 is 28 days before December 28. Wait, maybe that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, let's count the days from November 28 to December 31. November has 30 days, so from November 28 to November 30 is 2 days. Then December 1 to December 31 is 31 days. So total days from November 28 to December 31 is 2 + 31 = 33 days. If December 31 is a Saturday, then November 28 would be 33 days before that. Since 33 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 5 days. So subtracting 5 days from Saturday. Saturday minus 5 days is Monday. Wait, that would mean November 28 is a Monday? But earlier calculation suggested Wednesday. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that December 31, 2022 is a Saturday is wrong. Let me check again. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. But how do I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday? Let me think. For example, if I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Let me think. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that November 28, 2022 is the same as November 28, 2023, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that I know some other dates. For example, I know that November 11, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's true, then November 18 is Friday, 25 is Friday. Then November 25 is Friday, so November 26 is Saturday, 27 is Sunday, 28 is Monday. Wait, that would make November 28 a Monday. But earlier when I thought July 4 was Monday, I got Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that again. July 4, 2022: if July 4 is Monday, then July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. August 1 is Monday, so August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. September 5 is Monday. September 12 is Monday, September 19 is Monday, September 26 is Monday. October 3 is Monday, October 10 is Monday, October 17 is Monday, October 24 is Monday, October 31 is Monday. November 7 is Monday, November 14 is Monday, November 21 is Monday, November 28 is Monday. So that would make November 28 a Monday. So that's consistent with the previous calculation where December 31 is Saturday, and November 28 is 33 days before, which is 4 weeks and 5 days, so Saturday minus 5 days is Monday. So that seems to check out. Therefore, November 28, 2022 was a Monday.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if July 4, 2022 was a Monday. How can I confirm that? Let me think. If I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then that would be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday. That would make sense. So July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. So that's correct. Therefore, July 4 is Monday. Then following that, November 28 is Monday. So that seems to be correct.", "Monday"], [99, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, August 14, 2022 to Sunday, October 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Write the total number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, August 14, 2022, to Sunday, October 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by breaking it down into weeks and remaining days.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. August 14, 2022 is a Sunday. Then the next Sunday would be August 21, 2022. Then September 1, 2022 is a Thursday. Let me confirm the days of the week for these dates to make sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should list out the dates in weeks. Let's see:\n\nFrom August 14 (Sunday) to August 16 (Tuesday) is three days. Then August 17 (Wednesday) to August 20 (Saturday) is four days. Then August 21 (Sunday) is the next week. Then September 1 (Thursday) is the start of September. Then September 2 (Friday), September 3 (Saturday), September 4 (Sunday), and so on until October 16.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of days from August 14 to October 16 inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nAugust has 31 days. So from August 14 to August 31 is 31 - 14 = 17 days. But since August 14 is included, that's 17 + 1 = 18 days? Wait, no. Wait, if I start on August 14, then August 14 is day 1, August 15 is day 2, etc. So from August 14 to August 31 inclusive is 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days. Then September has 30 days, and October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So total days would be 18 (August) + 30 (September) + 16 (October) = 64 days total.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. August 14 to August 31: 31 - 14 = 17 days, but adding 1 for inclusivity gives 18 days. Then September is 30 days, and October 1-16 is 16 days. So 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days total. So there are 64 days in total from August 14 to October 16 inclusive.\n\nNow, out of these 64 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)? Let's find the number of weekends.\n\nSince August 14 is a Sunday, the next day, August 15 is a Monday. So the first week (August 14-20) includes Sunday (14), Monday (15), Tuesday (16), Wednesday (17), Thursday (18), Friday (19), Saturday (20). Then August 21 is Sunday again.\n\nSo in the first week (August 14-20), there are two weekends: Sunday (14) and Saturday (20). Wait, but August 14 is Sunday, and August 20 is Saturday. So that's two weekend days in that first week.\n\nThen August 21 is Sunday again. So each week after that would have one Sunday and one Saturday. Let's see how many weeks there are in total.\n\nTotal days: 64. Let's divide by 7 to find the number of weeks. 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. Wait, 7*9=63, so 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day. So that would mean 9 full weeks and one extra day.\n\nIn each full week, there are 2 weekend days (Sunday and Saturday). So 9 weeks would have 9*2=18 weekend days. Then the remaining 1 day is the next day after the 9 weeks. Since the first day is Sunday (August 14), the 63rd day would be the same as the first day of the week, which is Sunday. Then the 64th day is the next day, which is Monday. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, if the first day is Sunday (day 1), then day 7 is Saturday (the end of the first week). Then day 8 is Sunday again. So 9 weeks would be 63 days, which would end on Saturday (day 63). Then day 64 is Sunday again. Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous thought. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if August 14 is day 1 (Sunday), then day 7 is August 20 (Saturday). Then day 8 is August 21 (Sunday). So each week is 7 days. So 9 weeks would be 63 days. So day 63 would be the Saturday of the 9th week. Then day 64 is Sunday again. But the total days from August 14 to October 16 is 64 days. So the 64th day is Sunday, October 16. Wait, but that's the end date. So in that case, the 64 days include 9 full weeks (63 days) plus one day (Sunday). So the weekends would be 9*2 (from the full weeks) plus the weekend days in the extra day. But the extra day is Sunday, which is a weekend day. So total weekend days would be 18 + 1 = 19.\n\nWait, but that would mean 19 weekend days. So total business days would be 64 - 19 = 45. But wait, let me check again. Because if the first day is Sunday (day 1), then the first weekend is day 1 (Sunday) and day 7 (Saturday). Then the next week, day 8 (Sunday) and day 14 (Saturday). So each week has two weekend days. So 9 weeks would have 18 weekend days. Then the 64th day is Sunday, which is another weekend day. So total 19 weekend days. Therefore, 64 - 19 = 45 business days. But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of Saturdays and Sundays between the two dates.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's list the dates and count the weekends.\n\nStarting from August 14 (Sunday) to October 16 (Sunday). Let's count the number of Sundays and Saturdays in this period.\n\nFirst, August 14 is a Sunday. Then the next Sundays are August 21, 28, September 4, 11, 18, 25, October 2, 9, 16. Let's count those:\n\nAugust 14, 21, 28 (3 Sundays in August)\nSeptember 4, 11, 18, 25 (4 Sundays in September)\nOctober 2, 9, 16 (3 Sundays in October)\nTotal Sundays: 3 + 4 + 3 = 10 Sundays.\n\nNow Saturdays. The first Saturday after August 14 is August 20. Then August 27, September 3, 10, 17, 24, October 1, 8, 15. Let's count:\n\nAugust 20, 27 (2 Saturdays in August)\nSeptember 3, 10, 17, 24 (4 Saturdays in September)\nOctober 1, 8, 15 (3 Saturdays in October)\nTotal Saturdays: 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 Saturdays.\n\nSo total weekend days are 10 Sundays + 9 Saturdays = 19 days. Therefore, total business days are 64 - 19 = 45.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"inclusive of both dates\". So August 14 is included, which is a Sunday, and October 16 is included, which is a Sunday. So the total days are 64, and weekends are 19. So 64 - 19 = 45 business days. Therefore, the answer should be 45.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of days. Let me verify the total days again.\n\nAugust 14 to August 31: 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days (correct)\nSeptember has 30 days, so 30 days\nOctober 1 to October 16: 16 days\nTotal: 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days. Correct.\n\nSundays: 10, Saturdays: 9. Total 19. 64 - 19 = 45. So the answer is 45.", "45"], [99, "Count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022, and find out what day of the week that falls on. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can divide 70 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that: 70 divided by 7 is 10. So 70 days is exactly 10 weeks. Wait, if that's the case, then subtracting 10 weeks from September 2, 2022, should land me on the same day of the week, right? Because a week is 7 days, so subtracting a multiple of 7 days doesn't change the weekday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me confirm the date. September 2, 2022, is a Friday. If I subtract 7 days, that would be August 26, 2022, which is also a Friday. Then subtract another 7 days, August 19, 2022, also Friday. So every 7 days, the weekday remains the same. Therefore, subtracting 70 days (which is 10 weeks) would still be a Friday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're dealing with September, that's not an issue here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's try that. Starting from September 2, 2022 (Friday), subtract 7 days: August 26, 2022 (Friday). Subtract another 7: August 19 (Friday). Then August 12 (Friday), August 5 (Friday). Then July 29 (Friday). July 22 (Friday). July 15 (Friday). July 8 (Friday). July 1 (Friday). Then June 24 (Friday). Wait, that's 10 weeks, right? Let me count: 7 days each time. So 7 days x 10 = 70 days. So subtracting 70 days would be June 24, 2022. But wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, if I subtract 7 days 10 times, starting from September 2, 2022, the first subtraction is August 26, then August 19, 12, 5, July 29, 22, 15, 8, 1, then June 24. Wait, that's 10 subtractions. So June 24, 2022. But what day is that?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the dates. Let me check. Let's count the days step by step. Let's start from September 2, 2022 (Friday). Let's subtract 7 days each time:\n\n1. September 2 - 7 days = August 26 (Friday)\n2. August 26 - 7 = August 19 (Friday)\n3. August 19 - 7 = August 12 (Friday)\n4. August 12 - 7 = August 5 (Friday)\n5. August 5 - 7 = July 29 (Friday)\n6. July 29 - 7 = July 22 (Friday)\n7. July 22 - 7 = July 15 (Friday)\n8. July 15 - 7 = July 8 (Friday)\n9. July 8 - 7 = July 1 (Friday)\n10. July 1 - 7 = June 24 (Friday)\n\nSo that's 10 weeks, 70 days. So June 24, 2022, is a Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the number of days in each month. Let's see. From September 2, 2022, going back 70 days. Let's break it down:\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So September 2 minus 7 days is August 26. Then August has 31 days. So August 26 minus 7 days is August 19. Then August 19 minus 7 is August 12. August 12 minus 7 is August 5. August 5 minus 7 is July 29. July has 31 days. July 29 minus 7 is July 22. July 22 minus 7 is July 15. July 15 minus 7 is July 8. July 8 minus 7 is July 1. July 1 minus 7 is June 24. So that's 10 times 7 days. So June 24, 2022. Now, what day is June 24, 2022?\n\nWait, but I need to confirm that. Let me think. If September 2 is a Friday, then June 24 would be 70 days earlier. Since 70 is a multiple of 7, the day of the week should be the same. Therefore, June 24, 2022, is also a Friday. Therefore, the answer is Friday.", "Friday"], [99, "In a year where Saturday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 27. Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the weekday of March 27 in a year where January 1st is a Saturday. Hmm, I need to figure out what day of the week March 27 falls on.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of days between January 1st and March 27th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year unless stated otherwise. So February has 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to March 27th would be 31 (January) - 1 (since we start on January 1st) + 28 (February) + 27 (March). Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since day 0 is Jan 1). Then adding February's 28 days, that's 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March, so total days from Jan 1st is 58 + 27 = 85 days. Wait, but wait, maybe I should count the days from Jan 1 to March 27 inclusive? Or exclusive?\n\nWait, the problem says January 1st is Saturday. So if I want to find the day of the week for March 27, I need to count how many days are between January 1st and March 27th, then find the remainder when divided by 7. Because each week has 7 days.\n\nSo let's calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 27th. Let's do it step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. But since we start on January 1st, the number of days from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year), so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 59 + 27 = 86 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, etc. But the problem says January 1st is Saturday. So if I count the number of days from January 1st to March 27th inclusive, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 27 (Mar) = 86 days. But if I want to find how many days after January 1st, March 27th is, then it's 85 days later. Because January 1st is day 0, then day 1 is January 2nd, etc. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of days between January 1st and March 27th. Let's think of it as:\n\nFrom January 1st to January 31st: 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28th is 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 59 + 27 = 86 days. But since January 1st is day 0, then March 27th is 85 days after January 1st. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1st is day 0 (Saturday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Sunday), and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and March 27th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 27 = 30 + 28 + 27 = 85 days. So March 27th is 85 days after January 1st.\n\nNow, to find the weekday, we can take 85 divided by 7 and find the remainder. Because each week has 7 days. The remainder will tell us how many days ahead we are from Saturday.\n\nSo 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (which is 84 days) with a remainder of 1. So 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day. Therefore, March 27th is 1 day after Saturday. Saturday + 1 day is Sunday. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is Saturday, then adding 1 day would be Sunday. So March 27th would be Sunday?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the days step by step. Maybe I made a mistake in the total days.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then January 31st is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to day 30 + 28 = 58. Then March 27th is 27 days into March, so day 58 + 27 = 85. So yes, 85 days after January 1st. So 85 divided by 7 is 12*7=84, remainder 1. So 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Saturday (January 1st) would be Sunday. Therefore, March 27th is Sunday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary 1st is Saturday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Then January 8th is Saturday again, and so on. So January 1st (Saturday), 8th (Saturday), 15th (Saturday), 22nd (Saturday), 29th (Saturday). Then February 5th is Saturday. February has 28 days, so February 28th is 28 days after January 1st. Let's check: January 1st is day 0, January 29th is day 28 (since 29-1=28). Then February 28th is day 28 + 28 = 56? Wait, no. Wait, January 1st is day 0. January 2nd is day 1. So January 29th is day 28. Then February 1st is day 29. February 28th is day 29 + 27 = 56. Then March 1st is day 57. March 27th is day 57 + 26 = 83? Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 29th is day 28. Then February 1st is day 29. February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 29 + 27 = 56. Then March 1st is day 57. March 27th is 27 days after March 1st, so day 57 + 26 = 83? Wait, because March 1st is day 57, March 2nd is 58, ..., March 27th is 57 + 26 = 83. So that's 83 days after January 1st. But earlier I thought it was 85 days. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me check again. If January 1st is day 0, then January 31st is day 30. Then February 28th is day 30 + 28 = 58. Then March 27th is 27 days after February 28th, so day 58 + 27 = 85. But according to the other approach, March 27th is day 83. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the second approach. Let's count again. If January 1st is day 0, then:\n\nJanuary 1st: 0\n\nJanuary 2nd: 1\n\n...\n\nJanuary 31st: 30\n\nFebruary 1st: 31\n\nFebruary 28th: 31 + 27 = 58 (since February has 28 days, so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days, so day 31 + 27 = 58? Wait, no. Wait, if February 1st is day 31, then February 28th is day 31 + 27 = 58. Because 28 days in February, so from day 31 (Feb 1) to day 31 + 27 = 58 (Feb 28). Then March 1st is day 59. Then March 27th is 27 days after March 1st, so day 59 + 26 = 85. Because March 1st is day 59, March 2nd is 60, ..., March 27th is 59 + 26 = 85. So that's correct. So March 27th is day 85. So that's 85 days after January 1st. So 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (84 days) with a remainder of 1. So 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Saturday (January 1st) gives Sunday. Therefore, March 27th is Sunday.\n\nBut earlier when I thought of March 27th as day 83, that was a mistake. So the correct total is 85 days. So the remainder is 1. So the answer should be Sunday.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's count the days step by step for a few months.\n\nJanuary 1st is Saturday. Let's count the days for each month:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Then January 8th is Saturday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Saturday. February has 28 days, so February 28th is 28 days after January 1st. Wait, but January 1st is day 0, so February 28th is day 28 + 28 = 56? Wait, no. Wait, January 1st is day 0. January 29th is day 28. Then February 1st is day 29. February 28th is day 29 + 27 = 56. Then March 1st is day 57. March 27th is day 57 + 26 = 83? Wait, that's conflicting again. Wait, why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the days. Let's take a concrete example. Let's count the days from January 1st to March 27th.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28th is 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 59 + 27 = 86 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then March 27th is day 85. Because day 0 is Jan 1, day 1 is Jan 2, ..., day 85 is March 27. So that's correct. So 85 days after January 1st. So 85 divided by 7 is 12*7=84, remainder 1. So 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Saturday (Jan 1) gives Sunday. Therefore, March 27th is Sunday.\n\nBut why did the other approach give me day 83? Because I think I made a mistake in that approach. Let me check again. If March 1st is day 57, then March 27th is 27 days later. But March 1st is day 57, so March 27th is day 57 + 26 = 83. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. Where is the error here?\n\nWait, if March 1st is day 57, then March 2nd is day 58, March 3rd is 59, ..., March 27th is day 57 + 26 = 83. But according to the other calculation, it's day 85. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the calculation of March 1st. Let's check. January has 31 days, so January 1st is day 0. January 31st is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 30 + 28 = 58. Then March 1st is day 59. So March 1st is day 59. Therefore, March 27th is day 59 + 26 = 85. Because March 1st is day 59, March 27th is 26 days later. So that's 59 + 26 = 85. So that's correct. So the previous calculation where I thought March 1st was day 57 was wrong. So that was the mistake. So March 1st is day 59, not 57. So March 27th is day 85. Therefore, the correct total is 85 days. So 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 1 day. So March 27th is 1 day after Saturday, which is Sunday.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Sunday.", "Sunday"], [99, "On which weekday did October 8, 2022 fall? Provide the full name of the weekday.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 8, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I might remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, if that's the case, then October 8 would be 7 days later, which would also be a Saturday. But that seems too easy. Wait, but if October 1 is a Saturday, then adding 7 days would make October 8 also a Saturday. But that would mean that October 8, 2022 was a Saturday. However, I need to make sure that October 1, 2022 was indeed a Saturday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the days of the week. If I know that a certain date is a specific day, I can count forward or backward. For example, if I know that October 8, 2022 is a Saturday, then October 1 is a Saturday minus 7 days, which is also a Saturday. But I need to confirm that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a perpetual calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or logical calculations. Let me think. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. July 4, 2022: if July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then July 11 would be a Monday as well. Then August 1 would be a Monday plus 21 days (since July has 31 days, so 31-4=27 days in July after July 4. Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, if July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday. Then August 1 would be a Monday plus 31 days (July has 31 days). 31 days later is 3 weeks and 3 days, so August 1 would be a Monday plus 3 days, which is Thursday. Then August 1 is a Thursday. Then August 8 would be a Thursday, and so on. But I'm not sure if July 4 was a Monday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 8, 2022 is the same as October 8, 2023, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year. So February has 28 days. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday minus 365 days. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days later is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then January 1, 2022 is Saturday. \n\nSo if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then let's count the days. Let's see, January has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday again. Then January 15, 22, 29 are also Saturdays. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26 are Saturdays. March 5, 12, 19, 26 are Saturdays. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 are Saturdays. May 7, 14, 21, 28 are Saturdays. June 4, 11, 18, 25 are Saturdays. July 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 are Saturdays. August 6, 13, 20, 27 are Saturdays. September 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 are Saturdays. October 8 is the next Saturday. So October 8, 2022 would be a Saturday. \n\nWait, that seems to align. So according to this calculation, October 8, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to make sure that my initial assumption that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday is correct. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make January 1, 2023 a Sunday. That's correct because 2022 is not a leap year. So that seems right. \n\nTherefore, October 8, 2022 was a Saturday.", "Saturday"], [99, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Tuesday, February 1 to Wednesday, April 20, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the dates. The start date is February 1, 2022, which is a Tuesday. The end date is April 20, 2022, which is a Wednesday. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nWait, I should verify the days of the week for those dates. Let me recall that February 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Then, April 20, 2022, was a Wednesday. Let me confirm that. For example, I know that March 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Then March has 31 days, so March 1 is Tuesday, March 2 is Wednesday, etc. April 1, 2022, would be a Saturday. Then April 20 would be 19 days later.

Wait, that doesn't match the initial statement. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let me check the actual calendar for 2022. Alternatively, I can use the fact that February 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nFrom February 1 (Tuesday) to April 20 (Wednesday). Let's break it down into months.\n\nFebruary 2022: February has 28 days in 2022 (since 2022 is not a leap year). So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. But since the start date is February 1, which is included, and the end date is April 20, which is included. So the total days would be:\n\nFebruary: 28 days (from Feb 1 to Feb 28 inclusive)\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 20 days (from April 1 to April 20 inclusive)\n\nWait, but that would be 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. But wait, that's if we include all days from Feb 1 to April 20. But wait, the start date is Feb 1, and the end date is April 20. So the total number of days between those two dates is 79 days? Let me check that again. \n\nWait, from Feb 1 to Feb 28 is 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 28 + 31 = 59 days up to March 31. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total is 59 + 20 = 79 days. So total days between Feb 1 and April 20 inclusive is 79 days. \n\nBut wait, if I calculate the difference between the two dates, using a date calculator, maybe I can confirm. Let me think. For example, if I take February 1, 2022, and add 79 days, does that get me to April 20? Let's see. February has 28 days, so adding 27 days to February 1 would take me to March 1 (since 28-1=27 days left in February). Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take me to April 1. Then adding 19 days more would take me to April 20. So 27 + 31 + 19 = 77 days? Wait, that's conflicting with the previous total. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. \n\nAlternatively, the number of days between two dates inclusive can be calculated as (end date - start date + 1). So if I can find the number of days between Feb 1 and April 20, inclusive, that's the total days. Let me check using another method. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that February 1, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nFrom Feb 1 (Tuesday) to April 20 (Wednesday). Let's count the number of weeks and days. \n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from Feb 1 to Feb 28 is 28 days. That's exactly 4 weeks (28 days), so Feb 28 is a Tuesday again. Then March has 31 days. March 1 is a Wednesday. March 1 is Wednesday, March 2 is Thursday, March 3 is Friday, March 4 is Saturday, March 5 is Sunday, March 6 is Monday, and so on. Then April 1 is a Saturday.

Wait, but the original problem says that April 20 is a Wednesday. That contradicts this. So maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual calendar. Let me think. Let me check the day of the week for April 20, 2022. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. So January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, etc. Then February 1, 2022, would be 31 days later. Since January has 31 days, so 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 1 is Saturday, adding 3 days would be Tuesday. So February 1, 2022, is a Tuesday. That's correct. \n\nNow, March 1, 2022, is 28 days after February 1 (since February has 28 days in 2022). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Tuesday. Wait, but earlier I thought March 1 was a Wednesday. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, if February 1 is a Tuesday, then February 2 is Wednesday, and so on. February 28 is a Tuesday (since 28 days is 4 weeks). Then March 1 is a Wednesday. Wait, that's correct. So March 1 is a Wednesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 2 is Thursday, March 3 is Friday, March 4 is Saturday, March 5 is Sunday, March 6 is Monday, March 7 is Tuesday, and so on. \n\nSo April 1, 2022, is 31 days after March 1. March has 31 days. So 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 1 is Wednesday, adding 3 days would be Saturday. So April 1 is a Saturday. Then April 2 is Sunday, April 3 is Monday, April 4 is Tuesday, April 5 is Wednesday, April 6 is Thursday, April 7 is Friday, April 8 is Saturday, April 9 is Sunday, April 10 is Monday, April 11 is Tuesday, April 12 is Wednesday, April 13 is Thursday, April 14 is Friday, April 15 is Saturday, April 16 is Sunday, April 17 is Monday, April 18 is Tuesday, April 19 is Wednesday, April 20 is Thursday. \n\nWait, so April 20 is a Thursday, not a Wednesday as stated in the problem. But the problem says that the end date is Wednesday, April 20. That's conflicting. So maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect? Or maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check again. \n\nWait, if March 1 is a Wednesday, then March 8 is also a Wednesday, March 15, March 22, March 29. Then April 5 is a Wednesday. Then April 12 is Wednesday, April 19 is Wednesday. So April 19 is Wednesday. Then April 20 is Thursday. So the problem says that April 20 is a Wednesday. That's conflicting. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I made a mistake in the day calculations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check again. Let me check the actual calendar for 2022. \n\nLooking up the calendar for 2022, April 20, 2022, was indeed a Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. So where is the mistake here? \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for March 1. Let me check again. If February 1 is a Tuesday, then February 28 is also a Tuesday. Then March 1 is a Wednesday. That's correct. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 8 is Wednesday, March 15 is Wednesday, March 22 is Wednesday, March 29 is Wednesday. Then April 5 is Wednesday. April 12 is Wednesday, April 19 is Wednesday. So April 19 is Wednesday, and April 20 is Thursday. But according to the problem, April 20 is a Wednesday. So that's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is incorrect? Or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the day calculation. Let me check using another method. \n\nLet me use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, ..., January 7 is Friday, January 8 is Saturday. Then February 1 is 31 days after January 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 1 is Saturday, adding 3 days is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Correct. \n\nThen February 28 is 28 days later, which is 4 weeks, so also Tuesday. March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. March 8 is Wednesday, March 15 is Wednesday, March 22 is Wednesday, March 29 is Wednesday. Then April 5 is Wednesday. April 12 is Wednesday, April 19 is Wednesday. So April 19 is Wednesday, April 20 is Thursday. Therefore, the problem statement must have an error. But the user says that the end date is Wednesday, April 20. So maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the day calculation. Let me check using an online calendar. \n\nWait, I can't access the internet, but I can use another method. Let me check the number of days between February 1 and April 20. \n\nFebruary 1 to February 28: 28 days. March has 31 days. April 1 to April 20: 20 days. Total is 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. So the total number of days between February 1 and April 20 inclusive is 79 days. \n\nNow, if the start date is Tuesday, and the end date is Wednesday, then the total days would be 79. But according to my previous calculation, April 20 is a Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check again. Let me think. \n\nIf April 20 is a Wednesday, then April 19 is a Tuesday. Then April 19 is Tuesday. Then April 18 is Monday, April 17 is Sunday, April 16 is Saturday. So April 1 is Saturday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 8 is Wednesday, March 15 is Wednesday, March 22 is Wednesday, March 29 is Wednesday. Then April 5 is Wednesday. April 12 is Wednesday, April 19 is Wednesday. So April 19 is Wednesday, April 20 is Thursday. Therefore, the problem statement must have an error. \n\nBut the user says that the end date is Wednesday, April 20. So maybe the problem is correct, and I need to proceed with that. Alternatively, maybe the start date is different. Wait, the user says the start date is Tuesday, February 1. Let me check that again. \n\nIf February 1 is Tuesday, then February 2 is Wednesday, and so on. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Then March 8 is Wednesday, March 15 is Wednesday, March 22 is Wednesday, March 29 is Wednesday. Then April 5 is Wednesday. April 12 is Wednesday, April 19 is Wednesday. So April 19 is Wednesday, April 20 is Thursday. Therefore, the problem statement must have a mistake. \n\nBut since the user says that the end date is Wednesday, April 20, I need to proceed with that. Maybe the problem is correct, and I need to adjust my calculations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in the day calculation. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me count the number of weekdays between February 1 (Tuesday) and April 20 (Wednesday). \n\nFirst, let's list the dates and their days of the week. \n\nFebruary 1: Tuesday (start date)\nFebruary 2: Wednesday\nFebruary 3: Thursday\nFebruary 4: Friday\nFebruary 5: Saturday\nFebruary 6: Sunday\nFebruary 7: Monday\nFebruary 8: Tuesday\n... and so on. \n\nBut this would take too long. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of weeks and days. \n\nTotal days between February 1 and April 20 inclusive is 79 days. \n\nNow, if the start date is Tuesday, and the end date is Wednesday, then the total days would be 79. \n\nNow, in 79 days, how many weeks and extra days are there? 79 divided by 7 is 11 weeks (77 days) and 2 days. So 11 weeks and 2 days. \n\nIn 11 weeks, there are 11 * 5 = 55 weekdays (since each week has 5 weekdays). Then, the remaining 2 days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So adding those two days, total weekdays would be 55 + 2 = 57. \n\nBut wait, if the start date is Tuesday and the end date is Wednesday, then the two extra days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So that would be 55 + 2 = 57 weekdays. \n\nBut according to the previous calculation, April 20 is a Thursday, so that would be conflicting. However, the problem states that the end date is Wednesday. So maybe the problem is correct, and the answer is 57. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total days is different. Let me check again. \n\nIf the start date is February 1 (Tuesday) and the end date is April 20 (Wednesday), then the total number of days is 79. \n\nBut if the end date is Wednesday, then the total days would be 79. \n\nBut if the start date is Tuesday and the end date is Wednesday, then the number of days between them is 79. \n\nBut if the start date is Tuesday, and the end date is Wednesday, then the number of weekdays would be 57. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of weekends. \n\nIn 79 days, there are 11 weeks (77 days) and 2 days. Each week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). So 11 weeks have 22 weekend days. The remaining 2 days are Tuesday and Wednesday, which are weekdays. So total weekdays would be 79 - 22 = 57. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 57. \n\nBut I need to make sure that the start and end dates are correct. Since the problem states that the end date is Wednesday, April 20, I have to go with that. So the answer is 57.", "57"], [99, "Name the day of the week for 05/21/2022.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know the day of the week for. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is a certain number of days away from a known date. Let's see. Let's take July 4, 2022 as a reference. July 4 is 21 days after May 21. Wait, May has 31 days, so May 21 to May 31 is 10 days (since 31-21=10). Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days to May 21 would take me to June 21. Then July 4 is 13 days after June 21 (June 21 to June 30 is 10 days, then July 1 to July 4 is 4 days, total 14 days? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me do it step by step.\n\nMay 21 to May 31: 31 - 21 = 10 days. Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days would take me to June 21. Then from June 21 to July 4 is 13 days (June 21 to June 30 is 10 days, then July 1 to July 4 is 4 days, total 14 days? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, June 21 plus 10 days is June 30. Then July 1 is 1 day, July 2 is 2, July 3 is 3, July 4 is 4. So from June 21 to July 4 is 10 + 4 = 14 days. So May 21 to July 4 is 10 (May) + 30 (June) + 14 (July) = 54 days? Wait, no. Wait, May 21 to May 31 is 10 days. Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days would be June 21. Then from June 21 to July 4 is 14 days. So total days from May 21 to July 4 is 10 + 30 + 14 = 54 days? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, May 21 to May 31 is 10 days (including May 21?), no, wait. If you go from May 21 to May 22, that's one day. So May 21 to May 31 is 10 days (since 31-21=10, but if you include both start and end, it's 11 days? Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should use the formula: number of days between two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's think about the day of the week. If I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards. Let's see. July 4 is Monday. July 3 is Sunday, July 2 is Saturday, July 1 is Friday. Then June 30 is Thursday. June 29 is Wednesday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 27 is Monday. Then June 27 is Monday. Then May 21 is how many days before June 27? Let's calculate. From May 21 to June 27: May has 31 days, so May 21 to May 31 is 10 days (since 31-21=10, but if you include May 21, it's 11 days? Wait, no. If you start on May 21, then May 22 is +1 day, so May 21 to May 31 is 10 days later. Then June 1 to June 27 is 27 days. So total days from May 21 to June 27 is 10 + 27 = 37 days. So if June 27 is Monday, then May 21 is 37 days before that. Now, since each week has 7 days, 37 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 2 days. So 37 days before Monday would be 5 weeks (35 days) before, which is Monday again, then minus 2 days would be Saturday. Wait, so if June 27 is Monday, then May 21 is 37 days earlier. 37 divided by 7 is 5*7=35, remainder 2. So subtract 2 days from Monday: Monday minus 1 day is Sunday, minus 2 days is Saturday. So May 21, 2022 would be a Saturday? But I need to confirm this because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another known date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If May 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then May 21 would be 20 days later. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday plus 6 days is Saturday. That matches the previous result. So that would mean May 21, 2022 is a Saturday. But I need to confirm if May 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check with another method. For example, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then January has 31 days, so January 1 is Saturday, January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year), so February 28 is a Tuesday (since February 5 is Saturday, adding 23 days: 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So February 5 + 23 days is February 28, which is Saturday + 2 days = Monday? Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me do it step by step. January 1 is Saturday. January 1 + 7 days is January 8 (Saturday). January 15 (Saturday), January 22 (Saturday), January 29 (Saturday). Then February 5 is Saturday. Then February 5 + 7 days is February 12 (Saturday), February 19 (Saturday), February 26 (Saturday). Then March 5 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday. Then March 12 is Saturday, March 19, March 26, April 2, April 9, April 16, April 23, April 30. May 7 is Saturday. Then May 1 is 6 days before May 7. So May 7 is Saturday, May 6 is Friday, May 5 is Thursday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 2 is Monday, May 1 is Sunday. So yes, May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Therefore, May 21 is 20 days later. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. Therefore, May 21, 2022 is a Saturday.

Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2028 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2028 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2028 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2028 minus 2000 is 28. 28 divided by 4 is 7. So 500 + 7 is 507. That means 2028 divided by 4 is 507 with no remainder. So that's good, it's divisible by 4.\n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 2028 divided by 100 is 20.28, which isn't a whole number. So it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition (divisible by 400) doesn't apply here. \n\nSince it's divisible by 4 and not a century year, according to the rules, 2028 should be a leap year. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 2028 divided by 4 is indeed 507, and since it's not a century year, the leap year rules apply. Yep, that seems right.

For example, I know that August 15, 2022, was a Monday. So if August 15 is a Monday, then August 14 would be a Sunday. Therefore, the start date in the question must be incorrect. Wait, but the question says the start date is Monday, August 14. That can't be right. So maybe there's a mistake in the question? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dates are correct, but I need to check again. Let me think. Let's take a different approach. Let's check the days of the week for those dates. Let me recall that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then, I can count the days step by step. But that might take too long. Alternatively, I can use the fact that August 15, 2022, was a Monday.

If I remember correctly, August 15, 2022, was a Monday. So August 14 would be a Sunday. Therefore, the start date in the question is incorrect. But the question says the start date is Monday, August 14. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe the user meant August 15 as the start date?

So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the dates are correct, and I'm miscalculating. Let me try to calculate the day of the week for August 14, 2022. Let's take a known date. For example, July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then, July has 31 days. So July 1 is Friday, July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. Then August 5 is Friday. Then August 5 is Friday, so August 6 is Saturday, August 7 is Sunday, August 8 is Monday. Wait, that would mean August 8 is a Monday. Then August 15 would be a Monday as well. So August 15 is a Monday. Therefore, August 14 is a Sunday. Therefore, the start date in the question is incorrect. The start date should be Sunday, August 14, and the end date is Monday, August 15. But the question says the start date is Monday, August 14. That's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. But assuming the question is correct, perhaps I need to proceed. If the start date is Monday, August 14, and the end date is Monday, August 15, then the period is from Monday to the next Monday, which is two days. But that would mean that the start date is Monday, August 14, and the end date is Monday, August 15. But that's only two days. So in that case, there are two Mondays: August 14 and August 15. But that would mean the answer is 2. However, if the start date is actually Sunday, August 14, then the Mondays would be August 14 (if that's a Monday) and August 15. But according to my previous calculation, August 14 is a Sunday. Therefore, the correct answer would be 1 Monday (August 15). But the question says the start date is Monday, August 14. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the start date to be Sunday, August 14, and the end date to be Monday, August 15. In that case, the Mondays would be August 15. So the answer would be 1. But the question says the start date is Monday. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the question. However, since the user is asking for the answer, I need to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again. Let's take August 15, 2022, as Monday. Then August 14 is Sunday. So if the start date is Sunday, August 14, and the end date is Monday, August 15, then there is one Monday (August 15). But the question says the start date is Monday, August 14. Therefore, if the start date is Monday, August 14, then the end date would be August 15, which is a Monday. So the period is from Monday to Monday, which is two days. Therefore, there are two Mondays. But that would mean that August 14 and August 15 are both Mondays.

Therefore, the start date in the question is incorrect. But the question says the start date is Monday, August 14. Therefore, there's a mistake. However, if I proceed with the given dates, assuming that August 14 is a Monday, then August 15 would be a Tuesday. Therefore, the period from Monday, August 14, to Monday, August 15 would be only one day (August 14), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If the start date is Monday, August 14, and the end date is Monday, August 15, then the period is from August 14 to August 15, inclusive. That's two days. So if August 14 is a Monday, then August 15 would be a Tuesday. Therefore, there is only one Monday in that period (August 14). Therefore, the answer would be 1. But this is based on the assumption that August 14 is a Monday, which contradicts my previous calculation. \n\nThis is confusing. I think the key here is to verify the actual days. Since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me try to recall that August 15, 2022, was a Monday. Therefore, August 14 is a Sunday. Therefore, the start date in the question is incorrect. However, if the user insists that the start date is Monday, August 14, then perhaps there's a mistake in the question. But assuming that the dates are correct as given, then the period from Monday, August 14, to Monday, August 15, would include two days: Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, only one Monday (August 14). Therefore, the answer is 1. But this is based on the assumption that August 14 is a Monday, which may not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. But since the question is given as is, I need to answer based on that.

Let's think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If July 1 is Friday, then July 8 is also Friday, July 15, 22, 29. Then August 5 would be a Friday as well. Then August 5 is Friday, so August 6 is Saturday, 7 Sunday, 8 Monday, 9 Tuesday, 10 Wednesday, 11 Thursday, 12 Friday, 13 Saturday, 14 Sunday, 15 Monday. Wait, that would mean August 15 is a Monday. So that matches the earlier thought. Then August 27 would be 12 days later.

So total 22 days. 22 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 1 day. So if August 5 is Friday, adding 22 days would be Friday plus 1 day, which is Saturday. So August 27 would be Saturday.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 21st, then determine what day that lands on.\n\nFirst, let me count the days. From January 1st to January 21st is 20 days later, right? Because if January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, and so on. So 21 minus 1 is 20 days. Wait, but when you count the days between two dates, sometimes it's inclusive or exclusive. But in this case, since we're starting on January 1st, which is day 1, then January 21st is 20 days after that. So that's 20 days.\n\nNow, each week has 7 days. So I need to divide 20 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 7 times 2 is 14, and 7 times 3 is 21. So 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks with a remainder of 6 days. Because 14 days is 2 weeks, and 20 minus 14 is 6. So that means 20 days later is 2 weeks and 6 days.\n\nSince January 1st is a Sunday, adding 2 weeks (which is 14 days) would still be a Sunday. Then, adding the remaining 6 days. Let's count those days. Starting from Sunday:\n\n1 day later is Monday (1),\n2 days later is Tuesday (2),\n3 days later is Wednesday (3),\n4 days later is Thursday (4),\n5 days later is Friday (5),\n6 days later is Saturday (6).\n\nSo adding 6 days to Sunday would land on Saturday.

Let's find the day of the week for August 31. Since August 7 is Sunday, adding 24 days (3 weeks) would be August 28 (Sunday). Then August 29 is Monday, August 30 Tuesday, August 31 Wednesday. So August 31 is a Wednesday. Then September 1 is Thursday. September has 30 days. So September 30 is a Friday (since 30 days later: 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days.

October 2 is Sunday. Oh, that matches the user's statement. So October 2 is Sunday. So that's correct.\n\nSo the period is from July 31 (Sunday) to October 2 (Sunday). Now, I need to count the number of weekdays (Monday-Friday) in this period.\n\nLet me break it down month by month.\n\nFirst, July: only July 31 is included. That's a Sunday, which is a weekend. So no weekdays in July except maybe if there are more days, but since the start is July 31, which is the last day of July, there's only one day in July, which is a Sunday. So 0 weekdays in July.\n\nThen August: August 1 to August 31. Let's count the number of days in August. 31 days. Now, August 1 is Monday. So the first day is Monday (weekdays), and the last day is Wednesday (August 31). So how many weekdays are there in August?\n\nFrom August 1 (Monday) to August 31 (Wednesday). Let's calculate the number of days. 31 days total. Let's see how many weekends are in August. Since August 1 is Monday, the first weekend is August 6 (Saturday) and August 7 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is August 13, 14, etc. So each weekend is 2 days. Let's calculate the number of weekends in August.\n\nTotal days in August: 31. Number of weeks is 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. So 4 weeks and 3 days. So in 4 weeks, there are 4 weekends (each with 2 days), so 8 days. Then the remaining 3 days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So the total weekends in August are 8 days. Therefore, the number of weekdays in August is 31 - 8 = 23 days. Wait, but wait, the first day is Monday, so the first 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) are weekdays. Then the next 28 days (4 weeks) have 20 weekdays (since each week has 5 weekdays). Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since August 1 is Monday, the first day is a weekday. The last day is Wednesday. So the number of weekdays in August is the number of days from Monday to Wednesday, plus the number of weekdays in the remaining days. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of weekends and subtract from total days.\n\nTotal days in August: 31. Number of weekends: 4 weeks (28 days) have 4 weekends (8 days), and the remaining 3 days (August 29, 30, 31) are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Wait, no. Wait, August 29 is Thursday (since August 28 is Sunday, 29 is Monday? Wait, earlier I thought August 31 is Wednesday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, August 1 is Monday. August 7 is Sunday. August 8 is Monday. So August 28 is Sunday, August 29 is Monday, August 30 is Tuesday, August 31 is Wednesday. So the last three days of August are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So in the 31 days of August, the weekends are the 4 weeks (28 days) which include 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays (8 days), and then the remaining 3 days (August 29-31) are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So no weekends in those three days. Therefore, total weekends in August are 8 days. Therefore, weekdays in August are 31 - 8 = 23 days. So that's 23 weekdays in August.\n\nThen September: September 1 is Thursday. September has 30 days. So the days go from Thursday to Friday (September 30). Let's calculate the number of weekends in September. September 1 is Thursday. The first weekend is September 4 (Saturday) and 5 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is September 11, 12, etc. So each week has 2 weekend days. September has 30 days. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks (28 days) plus 2 days (Thursday and Friday). So the weekends in September are 4 weeks * 2 days = 8 days. The remaining two days (September 29 and 30) are Thursday and Friday, which are weekdays. So total weekends in September are 8 days. Therefore, weekdays in September are 30 - 8 = 22 days.\n\nThen October: October 1 is Saturday, October 2 is Sunday. The period ends on October 2. So October 1 is Saturday (weekend), October 2 is Sunday (weekend). So there are no weekdays in October. So 0 weekdays in October.\n\nSo total weekdays from July 31 to October 2 would be 0 (July) + 23 (August) + 22 (September) + 0 (October) = 45 days. Wait, but wait, the start date is July 31 (Sunday) and the end date is October 2 (Sunday). So we need to include both dates. But in July, only July 31 is included, which is a Sunday. So that's correct. August has 23 weekdays. September has 22. October has 0. So total 23 + 22 = 45. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for August or September.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between July 31 and October 2.\n\nJuly 31 is Sunday. So the next day is August 1 (Monday). Let's list the days:\n\nJuly 31: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 1: Monday (weekday)\nAugust 2: Tuesday (weekday)\nAugust 3: Wednesday (weekday)\nAugust 4: Thursday (weekday)\nAugust 5: Friday (weekday)\nAugust 6: Saturday (weekend)\nAugust 7: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 8: Monday (weekday)\n... and so on until October 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of weeks between the two dates and then adjust for the remaining days.\n\nBut since the start and end dates are both Sundays, the total number of days between them is (October 2 - July 31) + 1. Let me calculate the number of days between July 31 and October 2 inclusive.\n\nJuly has 31 days, so from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September has 30 days, and October 2 is 2 days. So total days: 31 (July 31 to August 31) + 30 (September) + 2 (October 1 and 2) = 31 + 30 + 2 = 63 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, July 31 to August 31 is 31 days (since July 31 is day 1, August 31 is day 31). Then September has 30 days, so from August 31 to September 30 is 30 days. Then October 1 and 2 are 2 days. So total days from July 31 to October 2 inclusive is 31 (July) + 30 (August) + 2 (September and October)? Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is the first day. Then August has 31 days, so from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September has 30 days, so from August 31 to September 30 is 30 days. Then October 1 and 2 are 2 days. So total days from July 31 to October 2 is 31 + 30 + 2 = 63 days. Wait, but that would mean that the total number of days is 63. But if July 31 is day 1, then August 31 is day 31, September 30 is day 61, and October 2 is day 63. So that's correct. So total days is 63.\n\nNow, since the start and end dates are both Sundays, and the total number of days is 63, which is 9 weeks (63 / 7 = 9). So 9 weeks. In each week, there are 5 weekdays. So 9 * 5 = 45 weekdays. Therefore, the answer is 45. That matches the previous calculation. So that's the answer.", "45"], [99, "How many Tuesdays are there from Saturday, October 29, 2022 to Sunday, October 30, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

So I need to figure out the days of the week for those dates and count the Tuesdays.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week October 29, 2022, was. The user mentioned it's a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If October 29 is a Saturday, then October 30 would be a Sunday. So the period we're looking at is from Saturday the 29th to Sunday the 30th. \n\nNow, the question is, how many Tuesdays are in this two-day period? Well, if the first day is a Saturday, then the next day is Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. Neither of these is a Tuesday. Therefore, there are no Tuesdays in this range. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me think. If October 29 is a Saturday, then adding one day (October 30) is Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. So the days in between are only those two. So there's no Tuesday in there. Therefore, the answer should be zero.\n\nBut maybe I should verify the actual days. Let me think about the calendar. For example, if I check an online calendar or use a date calculator. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me recall that October 29, 2022, was indeed a Saturday. So October 30 would be a Sunday. Therefore, the two days are Saturday and Sunday. So there are no Tuesdays in that period. Therefore, the answer is 0.", "0"], [99, "Between Saturday, April 9, 2022 and Friday, July 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Friday occur?

First, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many Fridays are in there.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just count the Fridays directly. But how? Let me think. Maybe I can start by checking the day of the week for April 9, 2022. The problem says it's a Saturday. So April 9 is a Saturday. Then April 10 would be a Sunday, and so on. Let me confirm that. If April 9 is a Saturday, then April 10 is Sunday, April 11 is Monday, 12 Tuesday, 13 Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday. So April 15 is a Friday. That's the first Friday in the period.\n\nNow, I need to find all the Fridays from April 15 up to July 1, 2022. Let me figure out how many weeks and extra days there are in this period. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but since the start and end dates are specific, maybe that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can break down the months. Let's see:\n\nFirst, April: from April 9 to April 30. Then May (31 days), then June (30 days), and July 1 is the end date.\n\nWait, the period is from April 9 to July 1, inclusive. So April 9 is included, and July 1 is included. Let me calculate the total number of days in this period.\n\nFirst, April has 30 days. From April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have from day 9 to day 30 inclusive, that's 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. But wait, April 9 is the first day, so April 9 is day 1, April 10 is day 2, etc. So from April 9 to April 30 is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. So total days would be 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, the period is from April 9 to July 1 inclusive. So April 9 to April 30 is 22 days (since 30 - 9 + 1 = 22). Then May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. Wait, but if you add 22 + 31 + 30 + 1, that's 84 days. But that seems like a lot. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let's take April 9 to April 30: April has 30 days. So from the 9th to the 30th inclusive is 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 22 + 31 = 53. Then June has 30 days, so 53 + 30 = 83. Then July 1 is one day, so total is 84 days. So the total number of days between April 9 and July 1 inclusive is 84 days. Wait, but 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks. So that would mean exactly 12 Fridays? But that can't be right because the start date is a Saturday. So if the total days are 84, which is exactly 12 weeks, then the first day is Saturday, so the first Friday would be the 15th day (since April 9 is Saturday, then the next Friday is April 15, which is 6 days later. Wait, but 84 days is 12 weeks. So if the period starts on a Saturday, then the next day is Sunday, and so on. So the 1st day is Saturday, the 8th day is Saturday again, etc. So in 12 weeks, the number of Fridays would be 12, but since the first day is Saturday, the first Friday is the 6th day (April 15), and then every 7 days after that. So in 84 days, there would be 12 Fridays. But wait, if the total days are 84, then the last day is July 1, which is a Friday. Because 84 days later from April 9 would be July 1. So if April 9 is Saturday, then adding 84 days (12 weeks) would bring us to the same day of the week, which is Saturday again. Wait, but that contradicts the problem statement which says that July 1 is a Friday. Wait, that can't be. So there's a mistake here. Let me check the actual days.\n\nWait, maybe my calculation of the total days is wrong. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check what day of the week July 1, 2022 was. Wait, I can check online, but since I can't, I need to calculate it. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 9, 2022 is a Saturday. Let me check the days step by step.\n\nApril 9 is Saturday. Then April 10 is Sunday, 11 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 13 Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday. So April 15 is Friday. Then April 16 is Saturday, and so on. Let's count the number of days from April 9 to July 1.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 22 days (as before). Then May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. So total is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days. But if April 9 is Saturday, then adding 84 days would be 12 weeks later, so same day of the week. So July 1 would be Saturday. But the problem says that July 1 is a Friday. That's a contradiction. Therefore, my calculation of the total days must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that the period is from Saturday, April 9, 2022, to Friday, July 1, 2022, inclusive. So the end date is Friday, July 1. So if April 9 is Saturday, then July 1 is Friday. Let me check how many days between April 9 and July 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of days between April 9 and July 1. Let's do that step by step.\n\nApril 9 to April 30: 30 - 9 = 21 days, plus 1 day (inclusive) is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. So total is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days. But if April 9 is Saturday, then adding 84 days would be 12 weeks later, which would be Saturday again. But the problem says that July 1 is Friday. Therefore, there's a mistake here. So maybe my initial assumption that April 9 is Saturday is wrong? Wait, the problem says that the period starts on Saturday, April 9, 2022. So that's given. Therefore, there must be an error in my calculation of the total days. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the end date is July 1, which is a Friday, so the total number of days is not 84. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the number of days between April 9 and July 1, inclusive. Let me use another approach. Let's count the days from April 9 to July 1.\n\nApril 9 to April 30: 22 days (as before). Then May has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to May 31. Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days brings us to June 30. Then July 1 is one day. So total is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days. But if April 9 is Saturday, then July 1 should be Saturday. But the problem says it's Friday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which means that my initial assumption that April 9 is Saturday is wrong? Or maybe the problem is in the way I'm counting the days?\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual day of the week for April 9, 2022. Let me think. I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, let's count the days for April 9. Let's see:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31 days. April has 30 days.\n\nSo from January 1 to April 9:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (31 days from Jan 1 to Jan 31)\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril 9: 9 days\n\nTotal days from Jan 1 to April 9: 31 + 28 + 31 + 9 = 99 days. Wait, but that's from Jan 1 to April 9 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if I add 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 9 (April 9), that would be 31 + 28 = 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 9 is 99. So April 9 is the 99th day of the year. Now, since January 1 is a Saturday, the 99th day would be what day of the week?\n\nWell, 99 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 1 day. So 14 weeks is 98 days, so the 98th day is a Saturday. Then the 99th day is Sunday. Wait, but the problem says that April 9 is a Saturday. That contradicts this. Therefore, my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. So I need to check that.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual day of the week for January 1, 2022. Let me recall. I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But according to some sources, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but if that's the case, then the 99th day would be Sunday. But the problem says April 9 is Saturday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So maybe the problem is incorrect? Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let me check the day of the week for April 9, 2022. Let's use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. If March 1 is Monday, then March 8 is Monday, March 15 is Monday, March 22 is Monday, March 29 is Monday. Then April 5 is Monday. So April 5 is Monday. Then April 6 is Tuesday, April 7 Wednesday, April 8 Thursday, April 9 Friday. Wait, that would make April 9 a Friday. But the problem says it's a Saturday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there's a mistake here. So maybe my assumption that March 1 is Monday is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I need to check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that April 9 is a Saturday. Let me check that. If April 9 is Saturday, then April 15 is Friday (since April 9 is Saturday, April 10 is Sunday, 11 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 13 Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday). So April 15 is Friday. Then May 1 is the next day, which is Saturday. Wait, but if April 15 is Friday, then April 16 is Saturday. So May 1 is 26 days after April 15. Wait, April has 30 days, so from April 15 to April 30 is 16 days (30 - 15 = 15 days, plus 1 day is 16 days). Then May 1 is 16 days after April 15. So 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days. So if April 15 is Friday, then adding 16 days would be Friday + 2 days = Sunday. So May 1 is a Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, and so on. Then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. Then June 5 is Sunday. June 12 is Sunday, June 19 is Sunday, June 26 is Sunday. July 3 is Sunday. So July 1 is 2 days before Sunday, which is Friday. So that matches the problem's statement that July 1 is a Friday. Therefore, April 9 is a Saturday, and July 1 is a Friday. So that's correct. Therefore, my previous calculation of the total days between April 9 and July 1 inclusive is 84 days. But according to this, July 1 is Friday, which is 84 days after April 9. So if April 9 is Saturday, then adding 84 days (12 weeks) would be Saturday again. But according to the above, July 1 is Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the total days.\n\nWait, maybe I'm counting the days incorrectly. Let me check again. From April 9 to April 30: 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. Then May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. So total is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days. But according to the day of the week calculation, April 9 is Saturday, and July 1 is Friday. So that would mean that 84 days later is Friday, which is 84 days after Saturday. But 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 12 weeks later should be the same day of the week. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my calculation of the total days must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the period is from April 9 to July 1 inclusive, but when I calculated the days, I added 22 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July 1) = 84. But maybe that's not correct. Let me check the actual number of days between April 9 and July 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the number of days between two dates. Let me think. The number of days from April 9 to July 1 inclusive is equal to (July 1 - April 9) + 1. So if I can find the number of days between April 9 and July 1, then add 1.\n\nBut how to calculate that? Let's break it down:\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 = 21 days, plus 1 day (April 9) is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July 1 is 1 day. So total is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days. But according to the day of the week calculation, that's not possible. Therefore, there must be an error in the day of the week calculation. Wait, but earlier I thought that April 9 is Saturday, and July 1 is Friday. But according to the day count, adding 84 days to April 9 would bring us to July 1, which should be Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, July 1 is Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the day of the week calculation.\n\nLet me recheck the day of the week for April 9. If April 9 is Saturday, then April 15 is Friday (as before). Then May 1 is 16 days after April 15. 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days. So April 15 (Friday) + 2 days is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. June 5 is Sunday, June 12 is Sunday, June 19 is Sunday, June 26 is Sunday. July 3 is Sunday. Therefore, July 1 is two days before Sunday, which is Friday. So that's correct. So July 1 is Friday. But according to the day count, April 9 to July 1 is 84 days. So if April 9 is Saturday, then adding 84 days (12 weeks) should be Saturday again. But according to the day of the week calculation, it's Friday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, my calculation of the number"], [99, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check if the dates are correct. Wait, the start date is October 24, 2022, which is a Monday. The end date is January 16, 2022, which is also a Monday. But wait, January 16, 2022, is actually before October 24, 2022. That can't be right. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the question? Because January 16 is earlier than October 24. So maybe the end date is supposed to be later? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual dates.\n\nWait, October 24, 2022, is in the fall, and January 16, 2022, is in the winter. But 2022 is a non-leap year. Let me confirm the actual dates. Wait, October 24, 2022, is a Monday. Then, January 16, 2022, is a Monday as well. But that would mean the period is from a later date to an earlier date, which doesn't make sense. So maybe the end date is supposed to be January 16, 2023? Or maybe the user intended the dates to be in reverse? Because otherwise, the start date is after the end date. That would make the calculation impossible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual calendar. Let me think: October 24, 2022, is a Monday. Then, the next year, January 16, 2023, is a Monday. But the question says January 16, 2022. So that's a problem. Because 2022's January 16 is earlier than October 24. Therefore, the period from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, would be going backward in time. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question. Maybe the end date is supposed to be January 16, 2023? Or maybe the start date is supposed to be earlier? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023, but made a typo. Because otherwise, the question is invalid. Let me check the actual dates again. Let me confirm the day of the week for January 16, 2022. Let me think: January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So January 16, 2022, would be 15 days later. 15 days later: 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So January 1 (Saturday) + 15 days is January 16, which would be a Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with the user's statement that January 16, 2022, is a Monday. So maybe the user is wrong. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe I should use an online calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't access external resources, I need to calculate it manually. Let's try again. January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday. Then, January 3 is a Monday. So January 3 + 13 days is January 16. 13 days later. 13 divided by 7 is 1 week and 6 days. So January 3 (Monday) + 6 days is January 9 (Monday), then January 16 would be Monday again? Wait, no. Wait, January 3 is Monday. Adding 7 days is January 10 (Monday). Adding another 7 days is January 17 (Monday). So January 16 would be Sunday. Therefore, the user's statement that January 16, 2022, is a Monday is incorrect. Therefore, there's a mistake in the question. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the end date to be January 16, 2023. Let me check that. January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. So January 1 is Sunday, January 2 is Monday. Then, January 16 would be 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So January 16, 2023, would be a Monday. That matches the user's statement. Therefore, it's possible that the end date is supposed to be January 16, 2023, but the user wrote 2022 by mistake. \n\nAssuming that the end date is January 16, 2023, then the period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023, inclusive. Now, I need to calculate the number of business days between these two dates. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days between the two dates, then subtract the weekends. \n\nBut first, let's confirm the dates. October 24, 2022, is a Monday. January 16, 2023, is a Monday. So the period is from Monday, October 24, 2022, to Monday, January 16, 2023. \n\nNow, let's break this down into months. \n\nFrom October 24, 2022, to December 31, 2022, and then from January 1, 2023, to January 16, 2023. \n\nFirst, calculate the days in each month. \n\nOctober has 31 days. So from October 24 to October 31: 31 - 24 = 7 days (including October 24). Wait, but if we include both start and end dates, then October 24 is day 1, and October 31 is day 8. Wait, but the total days from October 24 to October 31 inclusive is 8 days. \n\nThen November has 30 days. December has 31 days. \n\nSo from October 24 to December 31: 8 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 69 days. \n\nThen from January 1 to January 16, 2023: 16 days. \n\nTotal days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023, inclusive is 69 + 16 = 85 days. \n\nNow, we need to subtract the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period. \n\nBut since the start date is a Monday, and the end date is a Monday, the total number of days is 85. Let's check if that's correct. \n\nWait, let's verify the total days again. \n\nOctober 24 to October 31: 8 days (including both ends). \n\nNovember: 30 days. \n\nDecember: 31 days. \n\nJanuary 1 to January 16: 16 days. \n\nTotal: 8 + 30 + 31 + 16 = 85 days. Yes. \n\nNow, how many weekends are in these 85 days? \n\nSince the start date is a Monday, the first day is Monday. Let's count the number of weekends. \n\nEach week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). \n\nBut since the total number of days is 85, which is 12 weeks and 1 day (12*7=84, 85-84=1). \n\nSo 12 weeks would have 12*2 = 24 weekend days. Then, the remaining 1 day is a Monday (since the first day is Monday). So no additional weekend days. \n\nTherefore, total weekend days are 24. \n\nTherefore, business days would be 85 - 24 = 61. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because the first day is Monday, and the last day is Monday. So the total days are 85. Let's check the number of weekends. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in each month. \n\nLet me try that approach. \n\nFirst, October 24, 2022, is a Monday. So October 24 is Monday. \n\nOctober 24 (Mon), 25 (Tue), 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri), 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon). \n\nSo in October, the weekends are October 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun). That's 2 days. \n\nThen November: November 1 is Tuesday (since October 31 is Monday, November 1 is Tuesday). \n\nNovember has 30 days. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays. \n\nNovember 1 is Tuesday. So the first Saturday is November 4 (Saturday), then 11, 18, 25. That's 4 Saturdays. Sundays would be November 5, 12, 19, 26. That's 4 Sundays. So total 8 weekend days in November. \n\nDecember: December 1 is Thursday (since November 30 is Wednesday, December 1 is Thursday). \n\nDecember has 31 days. Let's count the weekends. \n\nFirst Saturday is December 2 (Saturday), then 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5 Saturdays. Sundays are December 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. That's 5 Sundays. Total 10 weekend days in December. \n\nJanuary 1, 2023, is Monday (as per the user's statement). So January 1 is Monday, and the last day is January 16, which is Monday. \n\nJanuary 1 (Mon), 2 (Tue), 3 (Wed), 4 (Thu), 5 (Fri), 6 (Sat), 7 (Sun), 8 (Mon), 9 (Tue), 10 (Wed), 11 (Thu), 12 (Fri), 13 (Sat), 14 (Sun), 15 (Mon), 16 (Tue). Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, if January 1 is Monday, then January 1 is Monday, January 2 is Tuesday, ..., January 7 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Monday. So January 16 would be 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So January 16 is Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. But the user said January 16 is a Monday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, this suggests that my initial assumption that January 16, 2023, is a Monday is incorrect. Let me check again. \n\nIf January 1, 2023, is a Sunday, then January 1 is Sunday, January 2 is Monday. Then January 16 would be 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 15 days is Sunday + 1 day = Monday. So January 16 would be Monday. But if January 1 is Sunday, then January 1 is Sunday, and January 16 is Monday. But earlier, I thought that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. Let me check that. \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the actual day of the week for January 1, 2023. \n\nI know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023, would be a Sunday. Therefore, January 1, 2023, is a Sunday. Therefore, January 16, 2023, would be 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 1 day is Monday. Therefore, January 16, 2023, is a Monday. So that's correct. \n\nBut when I tried to count the days in January, I thought that January 1 is Monday, but that's wrong. It's Sunday. So January 1 is Sunday, January 2 is Monday, and so on. Therefore, January 16 is Monday. \n\nSo in January, from January 1 (Sunday) to January 16 (Monday), the weekends are Saturday (January 7) and Sunday (January 8), then Saturday (January 14) and Sunday (January 15). So that's 4 weekend days. \n\nWait, let's count again. \n\nJanuary 1 is Sunday. \n\nWeekend days in January: \n\n- January 7 (Saturday), 8 (Sunday) \n\n- January 14 (Saturday), 15 (Sunday) \n\nSo that's 4 weekend days. \n\nSo in January, from January 1 to January 16, there are 4 weekend days. \n\nSo total weekend days in the entire period: \n\nOctober: 2 \n\nNovember: 8 \n\nDecember: 10 \n\nJanuary: 4 \n\nTotal: 2 + 8 + 10 + 4 = 24 weekend days. \n\nTherefore, total business days are 85 - 24 = 61. \n\nBut wait, the original question said the end date is January 16, 2022, which is a Monday. But that's not possible because January 16, 2022, is a Sunday. So there's a mistake in the question. However, assuming that the end date is January 16, 2023, the answer is 61. \n\nBut the user might have intended the end date to be January 16, 2022, but that's a Sunday. So if the user wants to include that date, but it's a Sunday, then the business days would be different. However, the user said the end date is a Monday. Therefore, the correct end date must be January 16, 2023. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 61.", "61"], [99, "On which weekday did October 1, 2022 fall? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022 fell on. Let me think. I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but how do I confirm that? Maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. If I can count the days between October 1, 2022 and January 1, 2023, that might help. Let's see. From October 1 to October 31 is 31 days. Then November has 30 days, December has 31 days, and January 1 is the next day. So total days from October 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 is 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 92 days. Wait, but that's from October 1 to December 31, which is 92 days. Then January 1 is the next day, so 93 days total. But if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then October 1, 2022 would be 92 days before that. Let me check how many weeks and days that is. 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Sunday, subtracting 1 day would be Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Alternatively, maybe I can check another known date. For example, I remember that October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, but that's two years earlier. Wait, 2020 was a leap year, so February had 29 days. But that might not affect October. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think of another approach. If I know that October 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then October 8, 15, 22, 29 would also be Saturdays. Let me check if that makes sense. For example, if I look up a calendar for 2022, but since I can't actually look it up, I have to rely on my calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year, so the days of the week shift by one each year. Wait, but 2022 is not a leap year, so the next year, 2023, would have the same day of the week for the same date? Wait, no. Wait, if 2022 is not a leap year, then the number of days in 2022 is 365, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So, the same date in the next year would be one day later in the week. So if October 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then October 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. But I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, so that aligns. So that seems to check out. Therefore, my conclusion is that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday.", "Saturday"], [99, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Wednesday, September 21 to Wednesday, November 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Respond with just the number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Saturdays fall between Wednesday, September 21, 2022, and Wednesday, November 30, 2022, inclusive. Hmm, first, I should figure out the dates involved and then check each Saturday in that range.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The start date is September 21, 2022, which is a Wednesday. The end date is November 30, 2022, also a Wednesday. So the period is from one Wednesday to another Wednesday, which is exactly 12 weeks and 6 days? Wait, no. Wait, let me check the actual number of days between those dates.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7 to find the number of weeks, then adjust for any extra days. But since the start and end dates are both Wednesdays, the total number of days should be a multiple of 7? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, September 21 is a Wednesday. Let's count the days from September 21 to November 30. Let's break it down:\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (including the start date). Then October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. So total days from September 21 to November 30 inclusive would be 10 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 30 (Nov) = 71 days. Wait, but wait, if September 21 is day 1, then September 22 is day 2, etc. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (since 30-21=9, plus 1 for inclusive). Then October is 31 days, November is 30 days. So total days is 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. So the total period is 71 days.\n\nNow, since the start date is a Wednesday, and the end date is also a Wednesday, the total number of days is 71. Let me check if 71 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 1 day. Because 7*10=70, so 71 days is 10 weeks and 1 day. So that means there are 10 full weeks, and one extra day. Since the start date is a Wednesday, the next day is Thursday, and so on. So in 10 weeks, there are 10 Saturdays. Then the extra day is the 71st day, which is a Wednesday again. So that day is not a Saturday. Therefore, the total number of Saturdays would be 10.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because if the start date is a Wednesday, then the first Saturday would be September 24, 2022. Then each week after that. Let me count the number of Saturdays in each month.\n\nSeptember: From September 21 (Wednesday) to September 30. The Saturdays would be September 24 and September 25? Wait, no. Wait, September 21 is Wednesday. So September 24 is Saturday (21 + 3 days). Then September 24 is Saturday, then October 1 is Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, September 24 is Saturday. Then the next Saturday is October 1, then October 8, 15, 22, 29. Then November 5, 12, 19, 26. Let me count them.\n\nSo in September: 24 (1st Saturday). Then October has 5 Saturdays (1, 8, 15, 22, 29). November has 4 Saturdays (5, 12, 19, 26). Wait, November 30 is the end date, which is a Wednesday. So November 26 is a Saturday, then November 27 is Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday. So November has 4 Saturdays. So total is 1 + 5 + 4 = 10 Saturdays. So that matches the earlier calculation of 10 weeks. So the answer is 10.", "10"], [99, "In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. I need to figure out what day of the week April 3rd falls on, given that January 1st is a Tuesday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. Since January 1st is a Tuesday, January 1st is day 0 (or maybe day 1?), but I need to count the days from January 1st to April 3rd. Wait, if I start counting from January 1st as day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. But maybe it's easier to count the number of days between the two dates. \n\nSo, from January 1st to April 3rd, how many days is that? Let's calculate:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, etc. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of days after January 1st. So, if I want to find the day of the week for April 3rd, I need to find how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd, then take that number modulo 7 to find the offset from Tuesday.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total days:\n\nJanuary: 31 days. But since we start on January 1st, the number of days from January 1st to the end of January is 31 days. But if we're going up to April 3rd, we need to add February and March as well.\n\nSo:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (including January 1st)\nFebruary: 28 or 29 days? Wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"in a year where Tuesday is January 1st\". It doesn't mention leap years. But since the problem is about a specific date (April 3rd), maybe it's not a leap year? Or maybe it's possible that it's a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year. But maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but maybe the problem is in a specific year where January 1st is a Tuesday, and the user is to calculate based on that. But since the problem doesn't mention leap years, perhaps we can assume it's a non-leap year. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"in a year where Tuesday is January 1st\". So the year could be any year, but the key is that January 1st is a Tuesday. So, if the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check both possibilities? Or maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd would be different. So maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. But how can I know? Wait, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless of leap year. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption. So, assuming it's a non-leap year, February has 28 days, March has 31 days. So, from January 1st to April 3rd:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 30 days after Jan 1, but if we count the days between Jan 1 and April 3, inclusive, then it's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd is:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March has 31 days, and April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on January 1st, then the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd is (31 - 1) + 28 + 31 + 3? Wait, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is:\n\nFrom January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 31 (days in March) + 3 (days in April up to the 3rd). Wait, but that would be 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. But that's including all the days from January 1st to April 3rd. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then April 3rd is day 93? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31, and so on. So the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if you count from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive, the total number of days is (31 + 28 + 31 + 3) = 93 days. But if you start counting from January 1st as day 1, then April 3rd would be day 93. But if you start counting from January 1st as day 0, then April 3rd is day 92. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of it as the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd, not including January 1st. Wait, the problem is that if January 1st is Tuesday, then the next day, January 2nd is Wednesday, etc. So the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is the number of days after January 1st. So, for example, if I want to find the day of the week for April 3rd, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd, then take that number modulo 7. Because each week has 7 days, so the day of the week will cycle every 7 days.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd. Let's do it step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days to get to February 28th. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days to get to March 31st. Then April 3rd is 3 days after March 31st. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 3 is 92. So 92 days after January 1st. Therefore, April 3rd is 92 days after January 1st.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Tuesday, we need to find what day of the week 92 days later is. Since each week has 7 days, we can divide 92 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell us how many days ahead we are from Tuesday.\n\nSo 92 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7*13 is 91, so 92 is 7*13 + 1. So the remainder is 1. Therefore, 92 days later is 1 day after Tuesday. So Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday. Therefore, April 3rd would be a Wednesday?\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, if January 1st is Tuesday, then January 1st + 1 day is Tuesday + 1 day = Wednesday (January 2nd). So if 92 days later is 1 day after Tuesday, then April 3rd is Wednesday. But let me check again. Wait, 92 days later. Let me check the calculation again. Because if January 1st is day 0 (Tuesday), then day 1 is January 2nd (Wednesday), day 7 is January 8th (Tuesday again). So the day of the week is (day number) mod 7. So if day number is 0, it's Tuesday. Then day 1 is Wednesday, day 2 is Thursday, day 3 is Friday, day 4 is Saturday, day 5 is Sunday, day 6 is Monday, day 7 is Tuesday again. So the formula is: (day number) mod 7. If the remainder is 0, it's Tuesday. If remainder is 1, Wednesday, etc.\n\nSo 92 days after January 1st is day 92. So 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 92 mod 7 is 1. Therefore, day 92 is 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. So April 3rd is Wednesday. But wait, that seems too easy. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days.\n\nWait, let me recount the days between January 1st and April 3rd. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March has 31 days, and April 3rd is 3 days. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. Wait, but that would be including January 1st. Wait, no. Wait, if you start on January 1st, then the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 93 days. But if you want the number of days after January 1st, then it's 92 days. Because January 1st is day 0, then day 1 is January 2nd, and so on. So if April 3rd is the 93rd day of the year, then the number of days after January 1st is 92. Therefore, 92 days later. So 92 mod 7 is 1. So that would be 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. So April 3rd is Wednesday. But wait, maybe I should check with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1st as Tuesday. Then:\n\nJanuary 1st: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 8th: Tuesday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15th: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 22nd: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 29th: Tuesday\n\nThen February 5th: Tuesday (since January 29th + 7 days is February 5th)\n\nFebruary 12th: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 19th: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 26th: Tuesday\n\nMarch 5th: Tuesday\n\nMarch 12th: Tuesday\n\nMarch 19th: Tuesday\n\nMarch 26th: Tuesday\n\nApril 2nd: Tuesday (March 26th + 7 days is April 2nd)\n\nThen April 3rd is one day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, April 3rd is Wednesday. So the answer should be Wednesday.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's count the number of days in each month:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\n\nFebruary: 28 days (assuming non-leap year)\n\nMarch: 31 days\n\nApril: 3 days (up to the 3rd)\n\nTotal days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. But if January 1st is day 1, then April 3rd is day 93. But if January 1st is day 0, then April 3rd is day 92. So the number of days after January 1st is 92. So 92 days later. 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 1 day after Tuesday is Wednesday. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the method of counting the days step by step, as I did earlier, and found that April 2nd is Tuesday, so April 3rd is Wednesday. That seems correct. Therefore, the answer is Wednesday.", "Wednesday"], [99, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Thursday, June 30 to Tuesday, September 6, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Saturdays fall between Thursday, June 30, 2022, and Tuesday, September 6, 2022, inclusive. Hmm, first, I should figure out the dates involved and then check which Saturdays are in that range.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The start date is June 30, 2022, which is a Thursday. The end date is September 6, 2022, which is a Tuesday. So the period spans from June 30 to September 6, including both days.\n\nNow, I need to find all the Saturdays in this period. Let me start by figuring out the first Saturday after June 30. Since June 30 is a Thursday, the next day is Friday, June 31 (which is a Friday), then Saturday, July 1. So July 1, 2022, is a Saturday. That's the first Saturday in the range.\n\nNow, I need to count all the Saturdays from July 1 up to September 6. Let me break this down into months. July, August, and September.\n\nFirst, July 2022. July has 31 days. July 1 is a Saturday. Then each week has one Saturday. So July has 4 weeks and 3 days. Wait, July 1 is Saturday, then July 8, 15, 22, 29 are Saturdays. Then the next one would be August 5. Wait, July has 31 days. Let me check:\n\nJuly 1 (Sat), 8 (Sat), 15 (Sat), 22 (Sat), 29 (Sat). That's five Saturdays in July. Because July 29 is the fifth Saturday. Then August 5 would be the next one. Let me check: July 31 is a Sunday (since July 29 is Saturday, 30 is Sunday, 31 is Monday? Wait, no. Wait, July 1 is Saturday. July 1 + 7 days is July 8 (Sat). Then July 15 (Sat), 22 (Sat), 29 (Sat). Then August 5 is the next Saturday. Wait, July 31 is a Monday? Let me check that again. July 1 is Saturday. July 7 is Saturday. July 14 is Saturday. July 21 is Saturday. July 28 is Saturday. Then July 29 is Sunday, 30 is Monday, 31 is Tuesday. So July 31 is Tuesday. So August 1 is Wednesday. Then August 5 is a Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, August 1 is Wednesday. Then August 2 is Thursday, 3 is Friday, 4 is Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, August 1 is Wednesday. So August 1 (Wed), 2 (Thu), 3 (Fri), 4 (Sat). So August 4 is Saturday. Then August 11, 18, 25 are Saturdays. Then September 1 is a Wednesday? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a calendar or calculate the days step by step. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days and figure out how many Saturdays fall into each month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between June 30 and September 6, then divide by 7 and adjust for the remainder. But that might not be accurate because the start and end dates might not align with the week.\n\nAlternatively, since I know the start date is Thursday, June 30, and the end date is Tuesday, September 6, I can list all the Saturdays in between.\n\nLet me start by listing the dates:\n\nFirst Saturday is July 1, 2022.\n\nThen each subsequent Saturday is 7 days later. So July 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's five Saturdays in July.\n\nThen August 5, 12, 19, 26. That's four Saturdays in August.\n\nThen September 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Wait, but the end date is September 6. So September 2 is a Saturday, then September 9 is the next one, but September 6 is before that. So in September, only September 2 is a Saturday. Wait, but September 6 is Tuesday. So September 2 is a Saturday. Then September 9 would be the next one, but that's after September 6. So only one Saturday in September.\n\nSo total Saturdays would be 5 (July) + 4 (August) + 1 (September) = 10?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me check each month's Saturdays.\n\nJuly 2022:\n\nJuly 1 (Sat), 8, 15, 22, 29. That's five Saturdays.\n\nAugust 2022:\n\nAugust 5 (Sat), 12, 19, 26. That's four Saturdays.\n\nSeptember 2022:\n\nSeptember 2 (Sat), then September 9 is the next one. But September 6 is the end date, so only September 2 is included. So that's one Saturday.\n\nTotal: 5 + 4 + 1 = 10.\n\nBut wait, let me check if September 2 is indeed within the date range. The start date is June 30, which is included, and the end date is September 6. So September 2 is between June 30 and September 6, so yes. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates. Let me check the actual days for each date.\n\nBut since I don't have a calendar here, I need to rely on calculations. Let me check the days again.\n\nJune 30, 2022 is a Thursday. Then July 1 is a Friday? Wait, no. Wait, June 30 is Thursday. Then July 1 is Friday. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, if June 30 is Thursday, then July 1 is Friday. So the first Saturday would be July 2? Wait, that's a mistake I made earlier. Oh no! I think I messed up the initial calculation.\n\nWait, this is critical. Let me re-examine this. If June 30 is a Thursday, then July 1 is Friday. So the first Saturday after June 30 would be July 2. So that changes everything. So my previous calculation was wrong. So I need to correct that.\n\nSo the start date is June 30, 2022 (Thursday). Then July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday. So the first Saturday in the range is July 2. Then the next ones would be July 9, 16, 23, 30. Then August 6, 13, 20, 27. Then September 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. But the end date is September 6, so September 3 is included, but September 10 is after September 6. So in September, only September 3 is a Saturday.\n\nSo let's recalculate:\n\nJuly 2022: July 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five Saturdays.\n\nAugust 2022: August 6, 13, 20, 27. That's four Saturdays.\n\nSeptember 2022: September 3 is a Saturday. Then September 10 is next, which is after September 6. So only one Saturday in September.\n\nTotal: 5 + 4 + 1 = 10. Wait, same number as before. But the first Saturday is July 2 instead of July 1. But that's because June 30 is Thursday, so July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday. So the first Saturday is July 2. But then the count is still five in July. Let me check how many days are in July. July has 31 days. So July 2 is Saturday, then adding 7 days each time: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five Saturdays. Then August 6 is the next one. So that's correct.\n\nSo the total is 5 + 4 + 1 = 10. But wait, the end date is September 6. So September 3 is a Saturday, which is within the range. So that's correct. So the answer is 10?\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me count the dates step by step.\n\nStart date: June 30 (Thu), end date: September 6 (Tue).\n\nFirst Saturday is July 2 (Sat). Then:\n\nJuly 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (five Saturdays in July).\n\nAugust 6, 13, 20, 27 (four in August).\n\nSeptember 3 (Sat) is the next one. September 6 is Tuesday, so September 3 is included. So that's one in September.\n\nTotal: 5 + 4 + 1 = 10.\n\nBut wait, what about the end date? The end date is September 6. So September 3 is before that. So yes, included. So total is 10.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the start date is included. The start date is June 30, which is a Thursday. So the first Saturday is July 2. So the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the total number of days between June 30 and September 6, then divide by 7 and adjust. Let's try that.\n\nJune 30 to July 31 is 31 days (June 30 is day 0, July 1 is day 1, ..., July 31 is day 31). Then August has 31 days, and September 1 to September 6 is 6 days. So total days from June 30 to September 6 inclusive is 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 6 (September) = 68 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, June 30 to July 31 is 31 days (since June 30 is day 0, July 1 is day 1, July 31 is day 31). Then August has 31 days, so from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September 1 to September 6 is 6 days. So total days from June 30 to September 6 inclusive is 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 6 (September) = 68 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Because June 30 to July 31 is 31 days (since July has 31 days). Then August is 31 days, and September 1-6 is 6 days. So total is 31 + 31 + 6 = 68 days. But if I calculate the number of days between June 30 and September 6 inclusive, it's 68 days. Now, the number of Saturdays would be the total days divided by 7, rounded up or down depending on the start and end days.\n\nBut since the first day is Thursday (June 30), and the last day is Tuesday (September 6), the number of Saturdays would be the number of times Saturday occurs in that period.\n\nAlternatively, since the first Saturday is July 2 (day 2), and the last Saturday is September 3 (day 68 - 67 = 1? Wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since the first Saturday is July 2 (day 2), and the last Saturday is September 3 (day 68 - 67 = 1? Wait, maybe I need to calculate the number of days from June 30 to September 6 inclusive. Let me check that again.\n\nJune 30 is day 0. July 1 is day 1, July 2 is day 2, ..., July 31 is day 31. August 1 is day 32, August 31 is day 62. September 1 is day 63, September 6 is day 68. So total of 69 days? Wait, because from June 30 to September 6 inclusive is 69 days. Wait, June 30 is day 0, July 31 is day 31, August 31 is day 62, September 6 is day 68. So the total number of days is 69. Because 68 - 0 + 1 = 69 days. So 69 days in total.\n\nNow, the first day is Thursday (June 30), and the last day is Tuesday (September 6). So the days of the week for each day can be calculated. The first day is Thursday (day 0), then day 1 is Friday, day 2 is Saturday, day 3 is Sunday, day 4 is Monday, day 5 is Tuesday, day 6 is Wednesday, day 7 is Thursday again.\n\nSo the number of Saturdays would be the number of times day 2 occurs in the 69 days. Since the first day is Thursday (day 0), the first Saturday is day 2. Then each subsequent Saturday is day 2 + 7n, where n is 0,1,2,...\n\nSo the Saturdays are at days 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51, 58, 65. Let's check how many that is.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nDay 2: July 2 (Sat)\n\nDay 9: July 9 (Sat)\n\nDay 16: July 16 (Sat)\n\nDay 23: July 23 (Sat)\n\nDay 30: July 30 (Sat)\n\nDay 37: August 6 (Sat)\n\nDay 44: August 13 (Sat)\n\nDay 51: August 20 (Sat)\n\nDay 58: August 27 (Sat)\n\nDay 65: September 3 (Sat)\n\nThen the next one would be day 72, which is September 10, which is beyond the end date (September 6). So that's 10 Saturdays in total. So the answer is 10.\n\nYes, that matches the previous count. So the correct answer is 10.", "10"], [99, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, July 17, 2022 to Tuesday, August 23, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Provide the count as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, July 17, 2022, to Tuesday, August 23, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates. Then, subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. July 17, 2022 is a Sunday. The end date is August 23, 2022, which is a Tuesday. So the period starts on a Sunday and ends on a Tuesday.\n\nI need to calculate the total days between these two dates. Let me break it down into months. July has 31 days, so from July 17 to July 31 is 15 days (including July 17). Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total days would be 15 + 23 = 38 days. Wait, but wait, if I include both start and end dates, that's correct? Let me check again. From July 17 to July 31 inclusive: July 17 is day 1, July 18 is day 2, ..., July 31 is day 15 (since 31-17+1=15). Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total is 15 + 23 = 38 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 38 days.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of those 38 days are weekends. Let's list out the days of the week for each date.\n\nStarting with July 17, 2022, which is a Sunday. Then July 18 is Monday, July 19 Tuesday, July 20 Wednesday, July 21 Thursday, July 22 Friday, July 23 Saturday, July 24 Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo the first week (July 17-23) includes Sunday (17), Monday (18), Tuesday (19), Wednesday (20), Thursday (21), Friday (22), Saturday (23). So in this first week, there are 2 weekend days: Sunday (17) and Saturday (23).\n\nThen July 24 is Sunday again. July 25 is Monday, and so on. Let's see how many weeks there are in total. Let me count the number of weeks and days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in the period.\n\nLet me list the dates:\n\nFrom July 17 (Sunday) to August 23 (Tuesday). Let's find all the Sundays and Saturdays in this period.\n\nFirst, July 17 is a Sunday. Then the next Sundays would be July 24, August 7, August 14, August 21. Then August 28 would be the next Sunday, but that's beyond August 23. So in the period, Sundays are July 17, 24, 7, 14, 21. Wait, wait, let me check:\n\nJuly 17 (Sunday), then adding 7 days: July 24 (Sunday), then August 7 (Sunday), August 14 (Sunday), August 21 (Sunday). Then August 28 would be the next one, but that's after August 23. So that's 5 Sundays in total.\n\nNow Saturdays: July 17 is Sunday, so the previous Saturday is July 16. Then the next Saturdays would be July 23 (Saturday), August 6 (Saturday), August 13 (Saturday), August 20 (Saturday), and August 27 (Saturday). But August 27 is after August 23, so in the period, the Saturdays are July 23, August 6, 13, 20. That's 4 Saturdays.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check each date:\n\nJuly 17 is Sunday. So July 16 is Saturday. But July 16 is before July 17, so it's not included in the period. The period starts on July 17. So the first Saturday in the period is July 23 (since July 17 is Sunday, July 23 is Saturday). Then August 6, 13, 20. So that's 4 Saturdays.\n\nSo total weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in the period are 5 Sundays + 4 Saturdays = 9 days.\n\nTherefore, the total business days would be total days (38) minus weekends (9) = 29 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of Sundays and Saturdays.\n\nLet me list all the dates from July 17 to August 23 and check each day's weekday.\n\nJuly 17: Sunday (included)\nJuly 18: Monday\nJuly 19: Tuesday\nJuly 20: Wednesday\nJuly 21: Thursday\nJuly 22: Friday\nJuly 23: Saturday\nJuly 24: Sunday\nJuly 25: Monday\nJuly 26: Tuesday\nJuly 27: Wednesday\nJuly 28: Thursday\nJuly 29: Friday\nJuly 30: Saturday\nJuly 31: Sunday\nAugust 1: Monday\nAugust 2: Tuesday\nAugust 3: Wednesday\nAugust 4: Thursday\nAugust 5: Friday\nAugust 6: Saturday\nAugust 7: Sunday\nAugust 8: Monday\nAugust 9: Tuesday\nAugust 10: Wednesday\nAugust 11: Thursday\nAugust 12: Friday\nAugust 13: Saturday\nAugust 14: Sunday\nAugust 15: Monday\nAugust 16: Tuesday\nAugust 17: Wednesday\nAugust 18: Thursday\nAugust 19: Friday\nAugust 20: Saturday\nAugust 21: Sunday\nAugust 22: Monday\nAugust 23: Tuesday\n\nNow, let's count the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this list.\n\nSundays: July 17, 24, 31, August 7, 14, 21. Wait, that's 6 Sundays. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 5. Wait, July 31 is a Sunday. Then August 7, 14, 21. So that's 5 Sundays? Wait, July 17, 24, 31 (three Sundays in July), then August 7, 14, 21 (three Sundays in August). That's 6 Sundays total. But in the period from July 17 to August 23, August 21 is included. So July 17, 24, 31 (three Sundays in July), and August 7, 14, 21 (three Sundays in August). But August 21 is within the period (August 23 is the end date). So that's 6 Sundays. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 5. So I must have made a mistake there.\n\nSimilarly, Saturdays: July 23, 30 (July 23 is Saturday, July 30 is Saturday), then August 6, 13, 20. So that's 5 Saturdays. Wait, July 23, 30 (two in July), then August 6, 13, 20 (three in August). So total 5 Saturdays.\n\nSo total weekends are 6 Sundays + 5 Saturdays = 11 days. Therefore, total business days would be 38 total days minus 11 weekends = 27 business days. But wait, this contradicts my previous count. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, let me recount the total days. From July 17 to August 23 inclusive. Let me check the number of days again. July has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total is 15 + 23 = 38 days. That's correct.\n\nNow, in the list above, the dates from July 17 to August 23 are 38 days. Let me count the number of Sundays and Saturdays in that list.\n\nSundays: July 17, 24, 31 (three Sundays in July), August 7, 14, 21 (three Sundays in August). That's 6 Sundays. But August 21 is included, and August 23 is the end date. So that's correct.\n\nSaturdays: July 23, 30 (two in July), August 6, 13, 20 (three in August). That's 5 Saturdays. So total weekends are 6 + 5 = 11. Therefore, business days are 38 - 11 = 27.\n\nBut wait, when I listed the days, let me check each day:\n\nJuly 17: Sunday (weekend)\nJuly 18: Monday (business)\nJuly 19: Tuesday (business)\nJuly 20: Wednesday (business)\nJuly 21: Thursday (business)\nJuly 22: Friday (business)\nJuly 23: Saturday (weekend)\nJuly 24: Sunday (weekend)\nJuly 25: Monday (business)\nJuly 26: Tuesday (business)\nJuly 27: Wednesday (business)\nJuly 28: Thursday (business)\nJuly 29: Friday (business)\nJuly 30: Saturday (weekend)\nJuly 31: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 1: Monday (business)\nAugust 2: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 3: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 4: Thursday (business)\nAugust 5: Friday (business)\nAugust 6: Saturday (weekend)\nAugust 7: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 8: Monday (business)\nAugust 9: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 10: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 11: Thursday (business)\nAugust 12: Friday (business)\nAugust 13: Saturday (weekend)\nAugust 14: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 15: Monday (business)\nAugust 16: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 17: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 18: Thursday (business)\nAugust 19: Friday (business)\nAugust 20: Saturday (weekend)\nAugust 21: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 22: Monday (business)\nAugust 23: Tuesday (weekend? Wait, August 23 is Tuesday. Wait, in the list above, August 23 is Tuesday. So that's a business day. Wait, but in my previous count, I thought August 23 is Tuesday, which is a business day. So in the list above, the weekends are the ones marked as Saturday or Sunday. So August 23 is Tuesday, which is business. So in the list above, the weekends are:\n\nSundays: 17, 24, 31, 7, 14, 21 (6 days)\nSaturdays: 23, 30, 6, 13, 20 (5 days)\nTotal 11 weekend days.\n\nSo business days are 38 - 11 = 27.

First, I should check what day of the week May 18, 2022, was. Wait, the problem says that the start date is Wednesday, May 18, 2022. So that's a Wednesday. Then I need to count all the Tuesdays from that date up to and including June 3, 2022.\n\nLet me start by listing the dates and days. Since May 18 is a Wednesday, then May 19 is Thursday, May 20 is Friday, May 21 is Saturday, May 22 is Sunday, May 23 is Monday, May 24 is Tuesday. So the first Tuesday in this period is May 24, 2022. Then the next Tuesdays would be every 7 days after that. Let me check how many weeks are in the period from May 18 to June 3.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days between May 18 and June 3, inclusive. May has 31 days, so from May 18 to May 31 is 14 days (including May 18). Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total days is 14 + 3 = 17 days. Wait, but wait, if we include both start and end dates, then May 18 is day 1, and June 3 is day 17. So the total number of days is 17.\n\nBut let me confirm that. Let's count the days step by step. May 18 is day 1. Then May 19 is day 2, ..., May 24 is day 8 (since 18 + 6 days is 24). Then May 25 is day 9, and so on. Wait, maybe it's easier to just count the days between the two dates. Alternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 18 is a Wednesday.

Wait, maybe I should check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the number of weekends. Let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days from April 24 to June 24 inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30 is 30 - 24 + 1 = 7 days. Wait, April 24 is day 1, April 25 is day 2, ..., April 30 is day 7. Then May has 31 days, so May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days would be 7 (April) + 31 (May) + 24 (June) = 62 days. Wait, but that's from April 24 to June 24 inclusive? Let me check again.\n\nWait, April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (including both ends). Then May has 31 days, so adding that. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. So total days between April 24 and June 24 inclusive is 62 days.\n\nNow, how many of those are weekends? Weekends are Sundays and Saturdays. Let's count the number of Sundays and Saturdays in this period.\n\nStarting from April 24, which is a Sunday. So April 24 is Sunday, April 25 is Monday, ..., April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. So in April, there are two Sundays: April 24 and April 30. Wait, April 24 is Sunday, then the next Sunday is April 30? Wait, April 24 is Sunday, then April 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. Wait, so April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. So in April, there's only one Sunday (April 24) and one Saturday (April 30). Then May has 31 days. May 1 is Sunday, so May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 are Sundays. That's five Sundays. Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 are Saturdays. So five Saturdays in May. Then June 1 is Wednesday, so June 1 is Wednesday, so the first Saturday in June is June 2 (since June 1 is Wednesday, June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday. Wait, no. Wait, June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 (Wed), 2 (Thu), 3 (Fri), 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun). So the first Saturday in June is June 4. Then the next Saturdays are June 11, 18, 25. So that's four Saturdays in June. Wait, June 4, 11, 18, 25. That's four Saturdays. Then June 24 is a Friday. So in June, there are four Saturdays. So total Saturdays in the period: April 30 (1), May 2,9,16,23,30 (5), and June 4,11,18,25 (4). So total Saturdays: 1 + 5 + 4 = 10. Sundays: April 24 (1), May 1,8,15,22,29 (5), and June 5,12,19,26 (4). Wait, June 5 is Sunday. So that's 1 + 5 + 4 = 10 Sundays. So total weekends are 10 Saturdays + 10 Sundays = 20 days. So total weekdays would be total days (62) minus weekends (20) = 42 days. Wait, but wait, let me check again. Because if the total days are 62, and weekends are 20, then 62 - 20 = 42. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me recount.\n\nApril 24 is Sunday. April 30 is Saturday. So in April, there are two Sundays? Wait, April 24 is Sunday, then the next Sunday is May 1. So April has only one Sunday (24th). Then May has Sundays on 1,8,15,22,29. That's five Sundays. Then June has Sundays on 5,12,19,26. That's four Sundays. So total Sundays: 1 + 5 + 4 = 10. Saturdays: April 30 is Saturday. Then May has Saturdays on 2,9,16,23,30. That's five. Then June has Saturdays on 4,11,18,25. That's four. So total Saturdays: 1 + 5 + 4 = 10. So total weekends are 10 + 10 = 20. So 62 total days minus 20 weekends equals 42 weekdays. But wait, the start date is April 24 (Sunday) and end date is June 24 (Friday). So the end date is a Friday. So the last day is a weekday. So that should be correct. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between those dates.\n\nStarting from April 24 (Sunday), the next day is April 25 (Monday). So April 25 is Monday. Then April 26 is Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, etc. So in April, the weekdays are April 25 (Mon) to April 29 (Fri), that's 5 days. Then May has 31 days. May 1 is Sunday, so May 2 is Monday. So in May, there are 31 days. The number of weekdays in May would be 31 - 2 (Saturdays and Sundays). Wait, but how many weekends are in May? May has 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays, as we counted before. So 5 + 5 = 10 weekends. So 31 - 10 = 21 weekdays in May. Then June 1 is Wednesday. June 24 is Friday. So June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. Let's count the weekdays in June. June 1 is Wednesday, 2 Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday, 7 Tuesday, 8 Wednesday, etc. So from June 1 to June 24, the weekends are Saturday (4th, 11th, 18th, 25th) but June 25 is beyond the end date. So in June, the weekends are 4th, 11th, 18th. That's three Saturdays. Sundays are 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. But June 26 is beyond the end date (June 24). So Sundays in June are 5th, 12th, 19th. That's three Sundays. So total weekends in June are 3 + 3 = 6. So total weekdays in June would be 24 days - 6 weekends = 18 weekdays. So total weekdays would be April (5) + May (21) + June (18) = 5 + 21 + 18 = 44. Wait, but this contradicts the previous answer of 42. So there's a mistake here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm. Let me check again. The first approach said total days 62, minus 20 weekends = 42. The second approach says 5 + 21 + 18 = 44. There's a discrepancy here. So I need to find where I went wrong.\n\nLet me check the total days again. April 24 to June 24 inclusive. April has 30 days. From April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (including both). May has 31 days. June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. That's correct.\n\nNow, in the second approach, April has 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri from 25th to 29th). May has 21 weekdays. June has 18 weekdays. Total 44. But according to the first approach, 62 - 20 = 42. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second approach is wrong. Let me check the number of weekdays in May. May has 31 days. If there are 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays, that's 10 weekends. So 31 - 10 = 21 weekdays. That seems correct. Then June has 24 days. If there are 3 Saturdays and 3 Sundays, that's 6 weekends. So 24 - 6 = 18 weekdays. So 5 + 21 + 18 = 44. But according to the first approach, 62 - 20 = 42. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the first approach's count of weekends is wrong. Let me recount the weekends.\n\nApril: 1 Sunday (24th) and 1 Saturday (30th). So 2 weekends.\n\nMay: 5 Sundays (1,8,15,22,29) and 5 Saturdays (2,9,16,23,30). So 10 weekends.\n\nJune: 4 Saturdays (4,11,18,25) and 4 Sundays (5,12,19,26). But June 25 is beyond the end date (June 24). So in June, the Sundays are 5,12,19. That's 3 Sundays. The Saturdays are 4,11,18. That's 3 Saturdays. So total weekends in June are 3 + 3 = 6. So total weekends in the entire period: 2 (April) + 10 (May) + 6 (June) = 18. So total weekends are 18. Then total days is 62, so 62 - 18 = 44 weekdays. So that matches the second approach. So the first approach must have made a mistake in counting the weekends. Earlier, I thought there were 10 Saturdays and 10 Sundays, but that was wrong. Because in June, the Sundays are only 3 (5,12,19) and Saturdays are 3 (4,11,18). So total weekends are 2 + 10 + 6 = 18. So 62 - 18 = 44. Therefore, the correct answer is 44.\n\nBut wait, why did I think earlier that there were 10 Sundays and 10 Saturdays? Because I thought June had 4 Sundays, but that's incorrect. June 26 is beyond the end date (June 24), so only 3 Sundays in June. Similarly, June 25 is Saturday, which is beyond the end date. So in June, only 3 Saturdays. So the correct count is 2 (April) + 10 (May) + 6 (June) = 18 weekends. So 62 - 18 = 44 weekdays. Therefore, the answer should be 44.\n\nBut let me check with another method. Let's list the dates.\n\nApril 24 (Sunday) is the start. Let's count the weekdays from April 24 to June 24.\n\nApril 24: Sunday (not weekday)\nApril 25: Monday (1)\nApril 26: Tuesday (2)\nApril 27: Wednesday (3)\nApril 28: Thursday (4)\nApril 29: Friday (5)\nApril 30: Saturday (not)\nMay 1: Sunday (not)\nMay 2: Monday (6)\nMay 3: Tuesday (7)\nMay 4: Wednesday (8)\nMay 5: Thursday (9)\nMay 6: Friday (10)\nMay 7: Saturday (not)\nMay 8: Sunday (not)\nMay 9: Monday (11)\nMay 10: Tuesday (12)\nMay 11: Wednesday (13)\nMay 12: Thursday (14)\nMay 13: Friday (15)\nMay 14: Saturday (not)\nMay 15: Sunday (not)\nMay 16: Monday (16)\nMay 17: Tuesday (17)\nMay 18: Wednesday (18)\nMay 19: Thursday (19)\nMay 20: Friday (20)\nMay 21: Saturday (not)\nMay 22: Sunday (not)\nMay 23: Monday (21)\nMay 24: Tuesday (22)\nMay 25: Wednesday (23)\nMay 26: Thursday (24)\nMay 27: Friday (25)\nMay 28: Saturday (not)\nMay 29: Sunday (not)\nMay 30: Monday (26)\nMay 31: Tuesday (27)\nJune 1: Wednesday (28)\nJune 2: Thursday (29)\nJune 3: Friday (30)\nJune 4: Saturday (not)\nJune 5: Sunday (not)\nJune 6: Monday (31)\nJune 7: Tuesday (32)\nJune 8: Wednesday (33)\nJune 9: Thursday (34)\nJune 10: Friday (35)\nJune 11: Saturday (not)\nJune 12: Sunday (not)\nJune 13: Monday (36)\nJune 14: Tuesday (37)\nJune 15: Wednesday (38)\nJune 16: Thursday (39)\nJune 17: Friday (40)\nJune 18: Saturday (not)\nJune 19: Sunday (not)\nJune 20: Monday (41)\nJune 21: Tuesday (42)\nJune 22: Wednesday (43)\nJune 23: Thursday (44)\nJune 24: Friday (45)\n\nWait, but according to this count, there are 45 weekdays. But that contradicts the previous answer of 44. So now I'm confused. Where is the mistake here?\n\nLet me recount the count step by step. Starting from April 24 (Sunday) as day 0, but the count starts from April 25 as Monday (1). Let me list each day and check if it's a weekday.\n\nApril 24: Sunday (not)\nApril 25: Monday (1)\nApril 26: Tuesday (2)\nApril 27: Wednesday (3)\nApril 28: Thursday (4)\nApril 29: Friday (5)\nApril 30: Saturday (not)\nMay 1: Sunday (not)\nMay 2: Monday (6)\nMay 3: Tuesday (7)\nMay 4: Wednesday (8)\nMay 5: Thursday (9)\nMay 6: Friday (10)\nMay 7: Saturday (not)\nMay 8: Sunday (not)\nMay 9: Monday (11)\nMay 10: Tuesday (12)\nMay 11: Wednesday (13)\nMay 12: Thursday (14)\nMay 13: Friday (15)\nMay 14: Saturday (not)\nMay 15: Sunday (not)\nMay 16: Monday (16)\nMay 17: Tuesday (17)\nMay 18: Wednesday (18)\nMay 19: Thursday (19)\nMay 20: Friday (20)\nMay 21: Saturday (not)\nMay 22: Sunday (not)\nMay 23: Monday (21)\nMay 24: Tuesday (22)\nMay 25: Wednesday (23)\nMay 26: Thursday (24)\nMay 27: Friday (25)\nMay 28: Saturday (not)\nMay 29: Sunday (not)\nMay 30: Monday (26)\nMay 31: Tuesday (27)\nJune 1: Wednesday (28)\nJune 2: Thursday (29)\nJune 3: Friday (30)\nJune 4: Saturday (not)\nJune 5: Sunday (not)"], [99, "If today is Wednesday, March 30, 2022, what day of the week was it 2 days ago?

So I need to count backwards two days from Wednesday.\n\nStarting from today, which is Wednesday. One day ago would be Tuesday, right? Because if today is Wednesday, then yesterday was Tuesday. Then two days ago would be Monday. Let me double-check that. If I go back one day from Wednesday, that's Tuesday. Back another day, that's Monday. Yeah, that seems correct. So two days ago was a Monday. I think that's the answer.", "Monday"], [99, "If today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022, what day of the week was it 56 days ago? Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what day of the week it was 56 days ago, given that today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 56 days to determine the day of the week.\n\nFirst, I know that a week has 7 days. So if I divide 56 by 7, that should give me the number of weeks. Let me do that calculation: 56 divided by 7 is exactly 8. So 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. Since 8 weeks is 56 days, that means 56 days ago would be the same day of the week as today. Wait, but that can't be right because if you go back 7 days, it's the same day, so going back 56 days, which is 8 times 7, should also be the same day. So if today is Tuesday, then 56 days ago would also be a Tuesday? But wait, maybe I need to check if there's any leap year or something affecting the days? Wait, February 8, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let me think again. If I subtract 56 days, which is exactly 8 weeks, then the day of the week should be the same. So the answer should be Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should verify this with a different approach. Let me count backwards step by step. Let's take 56 days and break it down. For example, 7 days before February 8, 2022, would be February 1, 2022, which is a Monday. Then 14 days before would be January 25, 2022, which is also a Monday. Continuing this pattern, each 7-day interval would be the same day. So 21 days before would be January 18, 2022, Monday. 28 days before would be January 11, 2022, Monday. 35 days before would be January 4, 2022, Monday. 42 days before would be December 27, 2021, Monday. 49 days before would be December 20, 2021, Monday. 56 days before would be December 13, 2021. Wait, but if I check December 13, 2021, what day was that? Let me think. Wait, maybe I should check a calendar. But since I don't have a calendar here, maybe I can use another method. Alternatively, since 56 days is exactly 8 weeks, then regardless of the actual dates, the day of the week should be the same. So if today is Tuesday, then 56 days ago would also be Tuesday. But maybe I made a mistake in assuming that 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. Let me check: 7 days is a week, so 7*8=56. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be Tuesday. But wait, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me check with another approach. Let's take today as Tuesday, February 8, 2022. Let's subtract 56 days. Let's break it down into months. February has 28 days in 2022 (since 2022 is not a leap year). So February 8 minus 28 days would be January 8, 2022. Wait, but that's only 28 days. Wait, 56 days would be two months. Let me think. From February 8, subtract 28 days to get January 8, 2022. Then subtract another 28 days to get December 8, 2021. Wait, but that's 56 days. So December 8, 2021. Now, what day of the week was December 8, 2021? If I can figure that out, it should be the same as Tuesday. But how? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if I go back 56 days, which is 8 weeks, then the day of the week is the same. So regardless of the actual date, the day of the week should be Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [99, "Tell me whether 1999 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1999 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 1999. First, divide 1999 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 499 is 1996, so 1999 minus 1996 is 3. That means 1999 divided by 4 is 499.75, which isn't a whole number. So 1999 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should check if it's a century year. Century years are every 100 years, like 1900, 2000, etc. 1999 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So even if it were divisible by 4, which it isn't, the second condition wouldn't apply. But since it's not divisible by 4 at all, the answer is no. So 1999 is not a leap year.", "No"], [99, "How many Tuesdays are there from Sunday, September 18, 2022 to Tuesday, November 15, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Write the total number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many Tuesdays there are between September 18, 2022 (Sunday) and November 15, 2022 (Tuesday), inclusive. Hmm. Alright, first, maybe I should check what day of the week each of these dates is. Wait, the problem already says that September 18 is a Sunday and November 15 is a Tuesday. So that's given. So I don't need to calculate that myself.\n\nSo the task is to count all the Tuesdays from the start date (Sunday, Sep 18) up to the end date (Tuesday, Nov 15), including both dates. Let me think. Since the start date is a Sunday, the first Tuesday after that would be September 20, 2022. Then each subsequent Tuesday would be 7 days later. But I need to make sure that I don't miss any Tuesdays in between and also include the last one, which is November 15.\n\nWait, but the end date is a Tuesday. So that's one of the Tuesdays. So I need to count all Tuesdays from September 20 (the first one after the start date) up to November 15, inclusive.\n\nLet me break it down by months. Let's start with September. September 18 is Sunday. So September 20 is Tuesday. Then September 27 is the next Tuesday. Then October 4, 11, 18, 25. Then November 1, 8, 15. Let me list them all out.\n\nFirst, September: 20, 27. That's two Tuesdays. Then October: 4, 11, 18, 25. That's four Tuesdays. Then November: 1, 8, 15. That's three Tuesdays. So adding them up: 2 + 4 + 3 = 9. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nWait, September 20 is the first Tuesday. Then adding 7 days: 27. Then October 4 (27 +7=34, which is October 4). Then 11, 18, 25. That's four in October. Then November 1 (25 +7=32, which is November 1), 8, 15. So that's three in November. So total is 2+4+3=9. But wait, the start date is September 18 (Sunday), so the first Tuesday is September 20. The end date is November 15 (Tuesday). So that's included. So 9 Tuesdays in total?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check the actual dates. Let me confirm each month's Tuesdays.\n\nSeptember 2022: Let's check. September 18 is Sunday. So 19 is Monday, 20 is Tuesday. Correct. Then 27 is the next Tuesday. So that's two in September.\n\nOctober 2022: October 4 is a Tuesday. Then 11, 18, 25. That's four Tuesdays.\n\nNovember 2022: November 1 is a Tuesday. Then 8, 15. So three Tuesdays. So total is 2+4+3=9. So the answer should be 9?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's any other Tuesday in between. For example, maybe the first Tuesday is September 20, and the last is November 15. Let me count the number of weeks between those dates. Let's calculate the total number of days between September 18 and November 15, inclusive. But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since I already listed them, maybe that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks between the two dates. Let's see. From September 18 (Sunday) to November 15 (Tuesday). Let's calculate the total days. September has 30 days. So from September 18 to September 30 is 12 days (including September 18). Then October has 31 days, and November 15 is 15 days. So total days from September 18 to November 15 inclusive is 12 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 15 (Nov) = 58 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you include both start and end dates, then the total days would be (Sep 18 to Sep 30) is 13 days (since 30-18+1=13?), wait no. Wait, September 18 is day 1. Then September 19 is day 2, ..., September 30 is day 13. Then October has 31 days, so October 1 is day 14, October 31 is day 14 + 30 = day 44. Then November 1 is day 45, and November 15 is day 45 + 14 = day 59. Wait, but that's if I count each day. But maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of Tuesdays by checking how many weeks there are between the two dates.\n\nBut since the start date is a Sunday, and the end date is a Tuesday, the total number of days between them is (November 15 - September 18) + 1. Let me calculate the actual number of days. Let's see:\n\nSeptember 18 to September 30: 30 - 18 = 12 days, plus 1 day (inclusive) is 13 days.\n\nOctober has 31 days.\n\nNovember 1 to November 15 is 15 days.\n\nTotal days: 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. So from September 18 to November 15 inclusive is 59 days.\n\nNow, since the first day is a Sunday, the number of Tuesdays would be the number of times Tuesday occurs in that period. Since each week has one Tuesday, the number of Tuesdays would be the number of weeks plus one if the period includes a Tuesday. But since the first day is Sunday, the first Tuesday is day 3 (Sep 20). Then each week after that. So total number of Tuesdays would be floor((59 - 3)/7) + 1? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the first Tuesday is day 3 (Sep 20), and the last day is day 59 (Nov 15). Let's calculate how many Tuesdays there are. The first Tuesday is day 3, then day 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59. Let me count those:\n\n3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59. That's 9 Tuesdays. So that matches the previous count.

So January 1st is a Monday. Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think we can assume it's a non-leap year, so 28 days. Then March 3rd is the third day of March.\n\nSo from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding that to 30 gives 58 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days after February 28th, so total days from January 1st would be 58 + 3 = 61 days.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check that again. If January 1st is day 1 (Monday), then January 2nd is day 2 (Tuesday), and so on. But when calculating the number of days between two dates, sometimes it's easier to count the days from the start date. So from January 1st to March 3rd, how many days is that?\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is the starting point). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 30 (January) + 28 (February) + 3 (March) = 61 days. Wait, but that would be 61 days after January 1st. But if January 1st is day 0, then day 61 would be March 3rd. But since the problem says January 1st is a Monday, then each day after that adds one day of the week.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd. Let me count again. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days after February 28th. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 30 + 28 + 3 = 61 days. But if January 1st is day 0 (Monday), then day 1 is January 2nd (Tuesday), and so on. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of days passed since January 1st. So if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So March 3rd would be day 61. Then, since each week has 7 days, I can divide 61 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead of Monday March 3rd is.\n\nWait, but if January 1st is Monday, then adding 61 days would be 61 days later. Let me calculate 61 divided by 7. 7*8=56, so 61-56=5. So 5 days after Monday. Monday + 5 days is Saturday. Wait, but that would mean March 3rd is a Saturday? But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1st as Monday. Then January 8th is also a Monday (7 days later). January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is a Monday. So March 5th is Monday. Then March 3rd is two days before March 5th. So March 5th is Monday, so March 4th is Sunday, March 3rd is Saturday. So that would be Saturday. So that matches the previous calculation. So the answer is Saturday.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If March 5th is Monday, then March 3rd is two days before, which is Saturday. So that seems correct. So the answer should be Saturday. But let me make sure that the number of days between January 1st and March 5th is correct. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 5th is 5 days after February 28th, so 58 + 5 = 63 days. So 63 days from January 1st. 63 divided by 7 is 9 weeks exactly, so 63 days later is also a Monday. So that's correct. Therefore, March 5th is Monday. So March 3rd is two days before, which is Saturday. So the answer is Saturday.", "Saturday"], [99, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Tuesday, October 11 to Thursday, October 20, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between Tuesday, October 11 and Thursday, October 20, 2022, inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the dates involved. Let me check the dates. The start date is October 11, 2022, which is a Tuesday. The end date is October 20, 2022, which is a Thursday. \n\nNow, I need to list all the dates from October 11 to October 20 and count the weekdays. Let me start by listing each day:\n\nOctober 11: Tuesday (weekday)\nOctober 12: Wednesday (weekday)\nOctober 13: Thursday (weekday)\nOctober 14: Friday (weekday)\nOctober 15: Saturday (weekend)\nOctober 16: Sunday (weekend)\nOctober 17: Monday (weekday)\nOctober 18: Tuesday (weekday)\nOctober 19: Wednesday (weekday)\nOctober 20: Thursday (weekday)\n\nNow, let's count the weekdays.

Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any. From 11 to 20, that's 10 days total. The weekends are 15 and 16, so two days. So 10 - 2 = 8 weekdays. That matches. So the answer should be 8.", "8"], [99, "In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 11. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, what day of the week is March 11th? And I need to answer with the full weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 11th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is the starting point). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question just says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So I need to assume it's a common year unless told otherwise. But wait, if January 1st is a Wednesday, then depending on the year, February could have 28 or 29 days. But since the problem doesn't mention a leap year, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year. Let me check that. Wait, but if the year is not a leap year, then February has 28 days. But if it is a leap year, then 29. However, the problem doesn't specify. Wait, but maybe the key is that if January 1st is a Wednesday, then the year could be a leap year or not. But how do I know? Wait, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Or maybe I need to check both possibilities? Wait, but maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Let me think. Let's assume it's a non-leap year first. So January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 1st is 30 + 28 = 58 days after January 1st. Then March 11th is 58 + 10 = 68 days after January 1st. Wait, no. Wait, January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So March 11th is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 11 (days in March) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days between January 1st and March 11th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 11 = 30 + 28 + 11 = 69 days? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me think again. If January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31. February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59. March 11th is day 59 + 10 = day 69. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 69 days. Wait, but if I count from January 1st (inclusive) to March 11th (inclusive), that's 69 days. But if I want to find the number of days between January 1st and March 11th, not including January 1st, then it's 68 days. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, if January 1st is a Wednesday, then adding 68 days would give the day of the week. Wait, but how does that work? Because each week has 7 days. So 68 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder gives the number of days ahead. So 68 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 5 days (since 7*9=63, 68-63=5). So adding 5 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 5 days is Monday? Wait, Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday, +5 is Monday. So March 11th would be a Monday? But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. So from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. Then March 1st to March 11th is 11 days. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 31 + 28 + 11 = 70 days. Wait, but that's including both January 1st and March 11th. So if I want to find how many days after January 1st March 11th is, it's 70 - 1 = 69 days. So 69 days later. Then 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 6 days (since 7*9=63, 69-63=6). So adding 6 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday? Wait, Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 Friday, +3 Saturday, +4 Sunday, +5 Monday, +6 Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday. But earlier I thought 68 days, which would be 5 days. So which is correct? Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. If January 1st is day 0 (Wednesday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Thursday), and so on. So March 11th is day 69. So the number of days after January 1st is 69 days. So 69 divided by 7 is 9*7=63, remainder 6. So 6 days after Wednesday. So Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me count again. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. So from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. Then March 1st to March 11th is 11 days. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 31 + 28 + 11 = 70 days. But that includes both the start and end dates. So the number of days between January 1st and March 11th is 70 - 1 = 69 days. So 69 days after January 1st. So 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Wednesday. January 8th is also Wednesday (7 days later). January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Wait, March 11th is 6 days after March 5th. So March 5th is a Wednesday (since March 5th is 28 days after January 1st (28 days is 4 weeks, so same day). Wait, January 1st is Wednesday. Then February 28th is 28 days later, which is 4 weeks, so also Wednesday. Then March 5th is 1 day after February 28th, so Thursday. Then March 5th is Thursday. Then March 6th is Friday, 7th Saturday, 8th Sunday, 9th Monday, 10th Tuesday, 11th Wednesday. Wait, that would make March 11th a Wednesday. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So where is the mistake here? Let me check again. If January 1st is Wednesday. Then February 28th is 28 days later. 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks, so same day. So February 28th is Wednesday. Then March 1st is Thursday. March 2nd is Friday, March 3rd Saturday, March 4th Sunday, March 5th Monday, March 6th Tuesday, March 7th Wednesday. Wait, so March 5th is Monday. Then March 11th is 6 days later. So March 5th is Monday, March 6th Tuesday, 7th Wednesday, 8th Thursday, 9th Friday, 10th Saturday, 11th Sunday. Wait, that would make March 11th a Sunday. But that's conflicting with the previous calculation. So now I'm confused. Which is correct? Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Wednesday. Let's count the days in January. January has 31 days. So January 1st is day 0 (Wednesday). Then January 8th is day 7 (Wednesday). January 15th is day 14 (Wednesday). January 22nd is day 21 (Wednesday). January 29th is day 28 (Wednesday). Then February 5th is day 29 (Thursday). February 12th is day 36 (Thursday). February 19th is day 43 (Thursday). February 26th is day 50 (Thursday). Then March 5th is day 51 (Friday). Wait, because February 26th is day 50 (Thursday), March 1st is day 51 (Friday). Then March 5th is day 55 (Friday + 4 days = Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, March 1st is Friday. March 2nd is Saturday, March 3rd is Sunday, March 4th is Monday, March 5th is Tuesday. So March 5th is Tuesday. Then March 6th is Wednesday, 7th Thursday, 8th Friday, 9th Saturday, 10th Sunday, 11th Monday. Wait, so March 11th is Monday. But that contradicts the previous step where I thought March 5th was Monday. So where is the error here? Let me check again. If January 1st is Wednesday. Then January 1st is day 0. January 8th is day 7 (Wednesday). January 15th is day 14 (Wednesday). January 22nd is day 21 (Wednesday). January 29th is day 28 (Wednesday). Then February 5th is day 29 (Thursday). February 12th is day 36 (Thursday). February 19th is day 43 (Thursday). February 26th is day 50 (Thursday). Then March 1st is day 51 (Friday). March 2nd is day 52 (Saturday). March 3rd is day 53 (Sunday). March 4th is day 54 (Monday). March 5th is day 55 (Tuesday). March 6th is day 56 (Wednesday). March 7th is day 57 (Thursday). March 8th is day 58 (Friday). March 9th is day 59 (Saturday). March 10th is day 60 (Sunday). March 11th is day 61 (Monday). So according to this, March 11th is Monday. But earlier when I calculated 69 days later, which is 69 mod 7 = 6, so Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But according to this step-by-step count, it's Monday. So there's a discrepancy here. Where is the mistake? Let me check the total days again. From January 1st to March 11th: January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so from February 1st to February 28th is 28 days. Then March 1st to March 11th is 11 days. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 31 + 28 + 11 = 70 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then March 11th is day 69. Wait, because day 0 is January 1st, day 1 is January 2nd, ..., day 69 is March 11th. So 69 days after January 1st. 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks (63 days) and 6 days. So 6 days after Wednesday. Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step count, it's Monday. So which is correct? There's a contradiction here. Let me check the step-by-step count again. If March 11th is day 61, then 61 days after January 1st. Wait, but according to the previous count, March 11th is day 61. But that would mean that the total days from January 1st to March 11th is 61 days. But that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the days. Let me recount. January 1st is day 0. January 2nd is day 1. January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31. February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. March 1st is day 59. March 11th is day 59 + 10 = day 69. So March 11th is day 69. So that's 69 days after January 1st. So 69 divided by 7 is 9*7=63, remainder 6. So 6 days after Wednesday. Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step count, March 11th is day 61. Wait, that must be a mistake in the step-by-step count. Let me check again. Let's list the days step by step. January 1st: day 0 (Wednesday). January 8th: day 7 (Wednesday). January 15th: day 14 (Wednesday). January 22nd: day 21 (Wednesday). January 29th: day 28 (Wednesday). February 5th: day 29 (Thursday). February 12th: day 36 (Thursday). February 19th: day 43 (Thursday). February 26th: day 50 (Thursday). March 1st: day 51 (Friday). March 2nd: day 52 (Saturday). March 3rd: day 53 (Sunday). March 4th: day 54 (Monday). March 5th: day 55 (Tuesday). March 6th: day 56 (Wednesday). March 7th: day 57 (Thursday). March 8th: day 58 (Friday). March 9th: day 59 (Saturday). March 10th: day 60 (Sunday). March 11th: day 61 (Monday). Wait, so according to this, March 11th is day 61. But according to the other calculation, it should be day 69. So there's a discrepancy of 8 days. Where is the mistake here? Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake in the step-by-step count. Because if February 28th is day 58, then March 1st is day 59. So March 1st is day 59. Then March 11th is day 59 + 10 = day 69. But in the step-by-step count, I listed March 11th as day 61. That must be wrong. Let me check again. Let's count from March 1st as day 59. March 1st is day 59 (Friday). March 2nd is day 60 (Saturday). March 3rd is day 61 (Sunday). March 4th is day 62 (Monday). March 5th is day 63 (Tuesday). March 6th is day 64 (Wednesday). March 7th is day 65 (Thursday). March 8th is day 66 (Friday). March 9th is day 67 (Saturday). March 10th is day 68 (Sunday). March 11th is day 69 (Monday). Oh! So I must have made a mistake in the previous step-by-step count. So March 11th is day 69, which is Monday. So that aligns with the first calculation. So the correct answer is Monday. But earlier when I thought that March 11th was day 61, that was a mistake. So the correct day is Monday. Therefore, the answer should be Monday. But wait, according to the first calculation, 69 days after Wednesday is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step count, it's Monday. So why the discrepancy? Because 69 divided by 7 is 9*7=63, remainder 6. So 6 days after Wednesday. Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step count, it's Monday. So there's a contradiction. Wait, what's 69 mod 7? Let me calculate 7*9=63, 69-63=6. So 6 days. So Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the Sundays would be on the 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 24th. Wait, let me count again.

But wait, I need to make sure that December 2022 actually has that. Let me check the actual calendar for December 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can calculate it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think. If December 1, 2022, was a Thursday, then December 31, 2022, would be a Saturday. Because December has 31 days. Let's count from December 1 (Thursday) to December 31. 31 days later. Since 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Thursday would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. Wait, that would make December 31 a Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, if December 1 is Thursday, then December 8 is also Thursday. Then December 15, 22, 29. Then December 30 is Friday, 31 is Saturday. So yes, December 31 is a Saturday. So that's correct. So the Sundays in December would be on the 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer should be 25. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again. Maybe I should verify the day of the week for December 1, 2022. Alternatively, I can use another method. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 1 would be 20 days earlier.

Then the Sundays would be 4, 11, 18, 25. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer is 25. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can check the number of Sundays in December. December has 31 days. If the first Sunday is the 4th, then the last Sunday would be the 25th, because 25 + 7 = 32, which is beyond 31. So that's correct. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th.

Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I might remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year. So February had 28 days. Let me think. If I can find a date in 2022 that I know the day of the week for, I can count forward or backward. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 11 is also a Monday, July 18, July 25, August 1, August 8, etc. Then August 1 is a Monday. Then August 1 is Monday, so August 1 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday, so August 8 is Monday, August 15, 22, 29. Then September 5 is Monday. Then September 5 is Monday, so September 12, 19, 26. Then October 3 is Monday. So October 3 is Monday. Therefore, October 1 would be three days before that. So October 1 would be Friday? Wait, because October 3 is Monday, so October 2 is Sunday, October 1 is Saturday. Wait, that would make October 1, 2022 a Saturday. But I need to confirm if July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the day of the week for January 1, 2022. If I can figure that out, then I can count forward. For example, I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, if I can count the number of days from January 1 to October 1, 2022, I can find the day of the week.\n\nLet's calculate the number of days from January 1 to October 1. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since we start on day 1). Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and then October 1 is the first day of October. Wait, but we need to count from January 1 to October 1. So let's add up the days:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (but since we start on January 1, the days from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. But if we are counting from January 1 to October 1, we need to add the days of each month up to September. Wait, no. Wait, October 1 is the first day of October, so the number of days from January 1 to October 1 is the sum of the days in each month from January to September, plus 1 day (for October 1). Wait, no. Wait, if you start on January 1, then the number of days from January 1 to October 1 is the sum of the days in each month from January to September, and then October 1 is the next day. Wait, no. Wait, if you have January 1 as day 1, then January 2 is day 2, ..., January 31 is day 31. Then February 1 is day 32, and so on. So to get to October 1, you need to add the days of each month from January to September. Let me calculate that:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\n\nAdding these up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 30 (Jun) = 181\n181 + 31 (Jul) = 212\n212 + 31 (Aug) = 243\n243 + 30 (Sep) = 273\n\nSo from January 1 to September 30 is 273 days. Then October 1 is the next day, so 274 days from January 1. Wait, but if January 1 is day 1, then October 1 is day 274. So the number of days between January 1 and October 1 is 273 days (from Jan 1 to Sep 30) plus 1 day (Oct 1) is 274 days total. But since we need to find the day of the week, we can take 273 days from January 1 (which is a Saturday) and add 1 day for October 1. Wait, but if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 273 days would be the same as adding 273 mod 7 days. Because 7 days a week. So 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks exactly. So 273 days is exactly 39 weeks, so October 1 would be the same day as January 1, which is Saturday. Wait, but that can't be right because if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 273 days (which is 39 weeks) would still be Saturday. But that would mean October 1 is a Saturday. But earlier when I thought about July 4 being Monday, I thought October 1 was Saturday. But I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but if July 4 is a Monday, then let's check that. Let's count from July 4. July has 31 days, so July 4 is Monday. Then July 11 is Monday, July 18, July 25. August 1 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. August 8, 15, 22, 29. September 5 is Monday. September 12, 19, 26. October 3 is Monday. So October 3 is Monday. Then October 1 is two days before that. So October 1 would be Saturday. That matches the previous calculation. So that would mean October 1, 2022 is a Saturday. But wait, I thought earlier that July 4 was a Monday. Let me check that again. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday. Let me check that. July 1, 2022: if July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Thursday? Wait, no. Wait, July 4 is Monday. July 1 is three days before that. So July 1 would be Friday (since July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday). Wait, that's correct. So July 1 is Friday. Then, if July 1 is Friday, then January 1, 2022 would be... Let's see. From January 1 to July 1 is 182 days (since January has 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 1). Wait, 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59, +31 (Mar) = 90, +30 (Apr) = 120, +31 (May) = 151, +30 (June) = 181, then July 1 is 182 days. So 182 days from January 1 is July 1. If July 1 is Friday, then 182 days is 26 weeks (182/7=26). So 26 weeks is exactly 26 weeks, so January 1 would be the same day as July 1, which is Friday. But earlier I thought January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. That's a contradiction. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that July 4 is a Monday is wrong. Let me check again. If July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday. But if that's the case, then January 1 would be Friday. But I thought earlier that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let's use the fact that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, if January 1 is Saturday, then July 1 is 182 days later. 182 divided by 7 is 26 weeks exactly. So July 1 would also be a Saturday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where July 1 was Friday. So there's a mistake here. Where is the error?\n\nAh, wait, if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then adding 182 days (which is 26 weeks) would still be Saturday. So July 1, 2022 would be Saturday. Then July 4 would be Wednesday. Because July 1 is Saturday, July 2 is Sunday, July 3 is Monday, July 4 is Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous assumption that July 4 was Monday. So that suggests that my earlier assumption that July 4 was Monday was wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in that reasoning. So where is the error?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. For example, I know that October 1, 2022 is a Saturday. But how can I confirm that? Let me check with another method. Let's use the fact that January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, let's count the days from January 1 to October 1. As calculated earlier, that's 273 days (from Jan 1 to Sep 30) plus 1 day (Oct 1) is 274 days. 274 divided by 7 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So 274 days is 39 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 274 days would be Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, if January 1 is day 1 (Saturday), then day 274 is October 1. So 274 days later. Since 274 divided by 7 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So 39 weeks is 273 days, so day 273 is Saturday (same as day 1), then day 274 is Sunday. So that would mean October 1 is Sunday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought October 1 was Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days from January 1 to October 1. Let me recalculate that. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February has 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30. So adding those up:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\n\nSo from January 1 to September 30 is 273 days. Then October 1 is the next day, so 274 days from January 1. So 274 days later. Since 274 divided by 7 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Saturday, then October 1 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. But earlier, when I thought July 4 was Monday, that led me to think October 1 was Saturday. But that must have been wrong. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another known date. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If December 25 is Sunday, then November 25 is also a Sunday. Then October 25 is a Sunday. Then October 25 is Sunday. So October 25 is Sunday. Then October 25 is Sunday, so October 24 is Saturday, October 23 is Friday, October 22 is Thursday, October 21 is Wednesday, October 20 is Tuesday, October 19 is Monday, October 18 is Sunday. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, if October 25 is Sunday, then October 25 minus 24 days is October 1. So 24 days before October 25 is October 1. 24 days is 3 weeks and 3 days. So if October 25 is Sunday, then October 1 is Sunday minus 3 days, which is Thursday. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So now I'm really confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that October 1, 2022 is a Saturday. But how can I confirm that? Let me check with another approach. Let's use the fact that January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, let's count the days for each month:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (so January 1 is Saturday, January 8 is Saturday, etc.)\nFebruary: 28 days (so February 1 is Saturday, February 8, etc.)\nMarch: 31 days (March 1 is Saturday)\nApril: 30 days (April 1 is Saturday)\nMay: 31 days (May 1 is Saturday)\nJune: 30 days (June 1 is Saturday)\nJuly: 31 days (July 1 is Saturday)\nAugust: 31 days (August 1 is Saturday)\nSeptember: 30 days (September 1 is Saturday)\nOctober 1 is the next day after September 30. So September 30 is a Friday (since September 1 is Saturday, September 30 is 29 days later. 29 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 1 day. So September 1 is Saturday, September 8 is Saturday, September 15, 22, 29. So September 29 is Saturday, September 30 is Sunday. Wait, that would mean October 1 is Monday. But that contradicts previous calculations. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should use a different method. Let me check the actual day of the week for October 1, 2022. Wait, I think I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, I can use the fact that October 1, 2022 is the first day of the month. Let me think about the days of the week for the months. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then let's count the days for each month:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so January 1 is Saturday. Then February 1 is Saturday (since 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days, so January 1 + 31 days is February 1, which is Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, if January 1 is"], [99, "Count forward 80 days from Wednesday, July 6, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 80 days after Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Hmm, first, I should probably figure out the date 80 days later, then determine the weekday. But maybe there's a way to calculate the weekday without knowing the exact date? Let me think.\n\nI remember that each week has 7 days, so if I divide 80 by 7, the remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is. Let me do that calculation. 80 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 3 days. Because 7 times 11 is 77, and 80 minus 77 is 3. So, 3 days after Wednesday.\n\nStarting from Wednesday, adding 1 day would be Thursday, 2 days is Friday, and 3 days is Saturday. So, the weekday should be Saturday. Wait, but I should make sure that the date calculation is correct. Maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the days? Wait, July 6, 2022, is a Wednesday. Let me confirm that. Let me think, July 6, 2022. Let me check if I can count the days correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me verify the remainder again. 80 divided by 7 is 11*7=77, remainder 3. So adding 3 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday. So the answer should be Saturday. But wait, maybe I should check if the 80 days are all in the same month or not. Wait, July 6 plus 80 days. Let me try to count the days step by step.\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 6, adding 25 days would take me to July 31 (since 31-6=25). Then 80-25=55 days left. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 80 days from July 6. Let me break it down. July has 31 days. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days (31-6=25). Then August has 31 days, September has 30, October 31, etc. Wait, maybe I should count the days step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should use another approach. Let me think. If I start on July 6, 2022, which is a Wednesday. Let me count 80 days forward. Let's see:\n\nFirst, July has 31 days. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days (since 31-6=25). Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take me to August 31. That's 25 + 31 = 56 days. Then September has 30 days, so adding 30 days would take me to September 30, which is 56 + 30 = 86 days. Wait, but I need 80 days. So 56 days is July 31 plus August 31. Wait, no, 25 days in July (from July 6 to July 31), then 31 days in August (July 31 to August 31 is 31 days). So 25 + 31 = 56 days. Then September has 30 days. So 56 + 30 = 86 days. So 80 days would be 56 + 24 days into September. So 24 days into September is September 24. Wait, but that's 56 + 24 = 80 days. So the date would be September 24, 2022. Now, I need to check what day of the week that is.\n\nBut wait, if July 6 is a Wednesday, then adding 25 days (to July 31) would be 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday. So July 31, 2022, is a Sunday. Then adding 31 days (August) would take me to August 31, which is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So August 31, 2022, is a Wednesday. Then adding 24 days (to reach September 24) would be 24 days. 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. Therefore, September 24, 2022, is a Saturday. So that matches my initial calculation of adding 3 days to Wednesday. So the answer is Saturday.", "Saturday"], [99, "If a meeting is scheduled on the second Thursday of May 2022, on which day of the month does it occur? Reply with the numerical value. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out on which date the second Thursday of May 2022 falls. Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first week of May would start on Sunday, May 1. So the first Thursday of May would be May 4th, right? Because May 1 is Sunday, so adding three days gets to Thursday. Then the second Thursday would be the next week, so May 11th. Wait, but wait, maybe I should check again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nMay 1, 2022: Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday? Wait, that would mean the first Thursday is May 5th. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount. If May 1 is Sunday, then:\n\nMay 1: Sunday\nMay 2: Monday\nMay 3: Tuesday\nMay 4: Wednesday\nMay 5: Thursday. Oh right! So the first Thursday is May 5th. Then the second Thursday would be May 12th. Wait, but that's the second week. Wait, but the question says the second Thursday. So first Thursday is May 5, second is May 12. But wait, maybe I need to check the actual calendar for May 2022 to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think. If May 1 is Sunday, then the first Thursday is May 5, then the next Thursday is May 12, then May 19, and May 26. So the second Thursday would be May 12. But wait, is May 1 really a Sunday? Let me check. I think I might have confused the dates. Wait, I remember that in 2022, May 1 was a Sunday. Let me confirm with another approach. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then February 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. March 1 was a Tuesday. April 1 was a Friday. Then May 1 would be a Sunday. Yes, that's correct. So May 1 is Sunday. Therefore, the first Thursday is May 5, the second is May 12. So the answer should be 12. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the days of the week for May 2022.

So the second Thursday is May 12. Therefore, the answer is 12.", "12"], [99, "What day of the week was June 15, 2022? Provide the full name of the weekday.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 15, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, I could use a known date and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think. For example, I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding one day to Friday would make January 1, 2022 a Saturday. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me verify. Wait, 2021 started on a Friday, so 2022 would start on a Saturday? Because 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So yes, if 2021 started on Friday, then 2022 starts on Saturday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday.\n\nNow, I need to find June 15, 2022. Let's count the days from January 1 to June 15. Let's break it down month by month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days in 2022 (since it's not a leap year). March has 31 days, April has 30, May has 31, and June 15 is the 15th day of June.\n\nSo total days from January 1 to June 15 would be:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 31 days\nJune: 15 days\n\nWait, but if we're starting from January 1, then adding up the days up to June 15 would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 15 (June) = let's calculate that.\n\n31 + 28 is 59. 59 + 31 is 90. 90 + 30 is 120. 120 + 31 is 151. Then 151 + 15 is 166 days. So June 15 is 166 days after January 1, 2022.\n\nNow, since January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, adding 166 days to that date will give me the day of the week. But since each week has 7 days, I can divide 166 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the date is from Saturday.\n\nLet me compute 166 divided by 7. 7*23 is 161, so 166 - 161 is 5. So the remainder is 5. That means June 15 is 5 days after Saturday. Let's count:\n\nSaturday + 1 day is Sunday (1)\nSunday + 1 day is Monday (2)\nMonday + 1 day is Tuesday (3)\nTuesday + 1 day is Wednesday (4)\nWednesday + 1 day is Thursday (5)\n\nSo June 15, 2022 should be a Thursday. Wait, but I need to make sure that my calculation of the number of days is correct. Let me check again.\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February is 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 15. So adding those up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 15 (June) = 166. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 166 days. 166 divided by 7 is 23 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Saturday. Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. Therefore, June 15, 2022 was a Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another method. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if June 15 is 16 days before July 1. Let me check. June has 30 days, so June 15 + 15 days is June 30. Then July 1 is 1 day after June 30. So if July 1 is a Friday, then June 30 is a Thursday. Then June 15 would be 15 days before June 30. Let's count backwards. June 30 is Thursday. June 23 is Thursday (15 days before). Then June 15 is 8 days before June 23. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm confused here.\n\nWait, if July 1 is Friday, then June 30 is Thursday. Then June 23 is Thursday (since 30-23=7 days, so 7 days before June 30 is June 23, which is also a Thursday). Then June 16 would be a Thursday. So June 15 would be three days before that. Wait, June 16 is Thursday, so June 15 is Wednesday? That contradicts my previous conclusion. Hmm, so now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that July 1, 2022 is a Friday is wrong. Let me check. If I know that June 15 is Thursday, then July 1 would be 16 days later. 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. So July 1 would be a Saturday. But that contradicts my previous thought. So maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check an actual calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to find another way. Let me try again.\n\nLet me use another approach. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then let's count the days from January 1 to May 1.\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February 28 days, March 31, April 30. So up to April 30 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 = 120 days. Then May 1 is 121 days after January 1. 121 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 2 days. So January 1 is Saturday, adding 2 days would be Monday. So May 1, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. So maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use an online source or a different method. But since I can't do that, I need to be careful. Let me try to use another known date. For example, I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then June 15 would be 14 days later. 14 days is exactly 2 weeks, so June 15 would also be a Wednesday. But that contradicts my previous conclusion of Thursday. So now I'm really confused.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the correct day for June 1, 2022. Let me think. If May 1, 2022 was a Monday, then May has 31 days. So May 1 is Monday, May 8 is Monday, May 15 is Monday, May 22 is Monday, May 29 is Monday. Then June 1 is the next day, which would be Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean June 1 is Tuesday. Then June 15 would be 14 days later, which is Tuesday again. But that contradicts the previous thought that June 15 is Thursday. So now I'm really confused. Where is the mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that again. If I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start one day later, which would be Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. That seems correct. Then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is a Tuesday (since 28 days is 4 weeks, so same as February 5, which is Saturday. Wait, no. Wait, if February 5 is Saturday, then February 12 is Saturday, 19, 26. Then March 5 is Saturday. March has 31 days, so March 5 is Saturday, March 12, 19, 26, April 2 is Saturday. April 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7 is Saturday. May 14, 21, 28. June 4 is Saturday. Then June 15 is 11 days after June 4. 11 days is 1 week and 4 days. So June 4 is Saturday, June 11 is Saturday, June 18 is Saturday. So June 15 is 3 days before June 18, which would be Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting again. So according to this, June 15 would be Wednesday. But earlier calculations said Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I need to find a different approach. Let me use the fact that I know that July 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, if June 15 is 16 days before July 1, then 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days. So if July 1 is Saturday, then June 15 would be Saturday minus 2 days, which is Thursday. That matches the first calculation. So that would mean June 15 is Thursday. But earlier when I thought June 1 was Tuesday, then June 15 would be Tuesday + 14 days, which is Tuesday again. But that contradicts. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if July 1 is Saturday, then June 15 is 16 days before. Let me count backwards. July 1 is Saturday. June 24 is Saturday (16 days before July 1 is June 24). Then June 17 is Saturday. June 15 is two days before June 17, which is Thursday. So that's correct. So June 15 is Thursday. Therefore, the correct answer is Thursday. So why did the other approach give me conflicting results? Because I must have made a mistake in that approach.\n\nLet me check again. If June 15 is Thursday, then June 1 is 14 days before, which is Thursday minus 14 days. 14 days is 2 weeks, so June 1 is also Thursday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous thought that June 1 was Tuesday. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, if June 15 is Thursday, then June 1 is 14 days earlier. 14 days is exactly two weeks, so June 1 would also be Thursday. But earlier, when I thought that May 1 was Monday, then May 29 was Monday, then June 5 would be Monday. Wait, that would mean June 5 is Monday. Then June 1 is 4 days before June 5, which would be Friday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion that June 1 is Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that July 1 is Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. If June 15 is Thursday, then July 1 is 16 days later. 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. So July 1 is Saturday. That seems correct. So if July 1 is Saturday, then June 1 is 16 days before July 1, which is 16 days before Saturday. 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days. So June 1 would be Saturday minus 2 days, which is Thursday. So June 1 is Thursday. Then June 5 is Monday (since 4 days after Thursday is Monday). Wait, June 1 is Thursday, June 2 is Friday, June 3 is Saturday, June 4 is Sunday, June 5 is Monday. So that's correct. Then June 5 is Monday. Then June 15 is 10 days later. 10 days is 1 week and 3 days. So Monday + 3 days is Thursday. So June 15 is Thursday. That matches. So that's correct. Therefore, the correct answer is Thursday.\n\nEarlier confusion was due to miscalculating the days between May 1 and June 1. So the correct day is Thursday.", "Thursday"]]}
