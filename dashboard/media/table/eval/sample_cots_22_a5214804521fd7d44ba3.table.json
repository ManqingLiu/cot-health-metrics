Give the count numerically. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out the first Wednesday of May 2022. Hmm, first, I should check what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the days would go like this: May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday would be the 4th. But wait, maybe I should double-check because sometimes my memory can be off. Alternatively, I can think of other ways to verify. For example, if I know that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday, then adding three days would get me to Wednesday. So 1 + 3 = 4. That would make May 4 a Wednesday. But maybe I should check another date. Let's say, for example, May 5, 2022, was a Thursday. That seems right. So if May 4 is Wednesday, then that's the first one. But wait, what if the month starts on a different day? Wait, no, I think my initial assumption is correct. Let me think again. If May 1 is Sunday, then the first Wednesday is the 4th. So the answer should be 4. But I need to make sure that there isn't a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I can check an online calendar or use a different method. But since I can't access external resources, I have to rely on my knowledge. Another way: if I know that May 2022 has 31 days, and if the first Wednesday is the 4th, then the next ones would be 11th, 18th, 25th. That seems plausible. So yes, the first Wednesday is the 4th. Therefore, the answer is 4.", "4"], [74, "Between Tuesday, November 8, 2022 and Friday, December 16, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Answer with a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, November 8, 2022, and Friday, December 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) that fall within that period.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total days. November 8 is a Tuesday. Let me check the dates step by step.\n\nFrom November 8 to December 16. Let's break it down by months. November has 30 days, so from November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 = 22 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to add 1? Wait, no. If I count from November 8 to November 30 inclusive, that's 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. But then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. So total days would be 23 + 16 = 39 days. Wait, but maybe I should check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use a calendar or calculate the number of days between the two dates. But since I don't have a calendar here, I need to compute it manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that November 8 is a Tuesday. Let me check the days of the week for each month.\n\nFirst, November 8 is Tuesday. Let's count the days in November. November has 30 days. So November 8 is Tuesday. Then November 9 is Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday, 13 Sunday, 14 Monday, 15 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 17 Thursday, 18 Friday, 19 Saturday, 20 Sunday, 21 Monday, 22 Tuesday, 23 Wednesday, 24 Thursday, 25 Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday.\n\nSo from November 8 to November 30 inclusive: Let's count how many days that is. November 8 is day 1. Then November 9 is day 2, ..., up to November 30. The number of days is 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Now, in those 23 days, how many weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are there?\n\nLooking at the days:\n\nNovember 8 is Tuesday. Then the next Saturday is November 12 (Saturday), then Sunday 13. Then next Saturday is 19, Sunday 20. Then Saturday 26, Sunday 27. Then Saturday 3rd of December (but wait, December starts on the 1st. Wait, November 30 is Wednesday. So November 30 is Wednesday. Then December 1 is Thursday, 2 Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, etc.\n\nSo in November, the weekends are:\n\nNovember 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Wait, but November 30 is Wednesday, so the last weekend in November would be November 26 (Sat) and 27 (Sun). Then December 1 is Thursday. So in November, from November 8 to November 30, the weekends are:\n\nNovember 12, 13, 19, 20, 26, 27. That's 6 weekend days. Wait, but November 8 is Tuesday, so the first weekend in the period is November 12 (Saturday) and 13 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is 19 and 20, then 26 and 27. So that's 3 weekends, 2 days each, so 6 days total. So in November, between November 8 and November 30, there are 6 weekend days.\n\nThen December 1 to December 16. Let's check the days. December 1 is Thursday, 2 Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, 6 Tuesday, 7 Wednesday, 8 Thursday, 9 Friday, 10 Saturday, 11 Sunday, 12 Monday, 13 Tuesday, 14 Wednesday, 15 Thursday, 16 Friday.\n\nSo from December 1 to December 16, that's 16 days. The weekends here are December 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun). So that's 4 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period (November 8 to December 16) are 6 (November) + 4 (December) = 10 weekend days.\n\nTotal days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive is 23 (November) + 16 (December) = 39 days. Then subtract the 10 weekend days, so 39 - 10 = 29 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the days. Let me verify the total days again.\n\nFrom November 8 to November 30: 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. 23 + 16 = 39 days total. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the weekends in November: November 12, 13, 19, 20, 26, 27. That's 6 days. In December, December 3, 4, 10, 11. That's 4 days. Total 10. So 39 - 10 = 29 business days. So the answer should be 29.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by counting the business days directly. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tuesday) to December 16 (Friday). Let's count each week.\n\nFirst, November 8 is Tuesday. Let's count the days:\n\nWeek 1: November 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun). So business days here are 8-11 (4 days) and 12 is Sat, 13 is Sun. So 4 business days in the first week.\n\nWait, but the period starts on November 8, so the first week includes November 8-13. But the first week's business days are Tuesday to Friday (4 days). Then the next week is November 14 (Monday) to November 19 (Saturday). Business days here are Monday to Friday (5 days). Then November 20 (Saturday) to November 25 (Thursday). Business days are Monday to Friday (5 days). Then November 26 (Saturday) to November 30 (Wednesday). Business days are Monday to Wednesday (3 days). Then December 1 (Thursday) to December 4 (Sunday). Business days are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, December 1 is Thursday, 2 Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday. So business days are Thursday and Friday (2 days). Then December 5 (Monday) to December 8 (Thursday): 4 days. Then December 9 (Friday) to December 16 (Friday). Wait, December 9 is Friday, 10 Saturday, 11 Sunday, 12 Monday, 13 Tuesday, 14 Wednesday, 15 Thursday, 16 Friday. So business days from December 9 to 16: 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri). So business days are 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. That's 6 days.\n\nWait, maybe I need to break it down step by step.\n\nLet me list all the dates and check which are business days.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tue) to December 16 (Fri):\n\nNovember 8 (Tue) - business\n9 (Wed) - business\n10 (Thu) - business\n11 (Fri) - business\n12 (Sat) - not\n13 (Sun) - not\n14 (Mon) - business\n15 (Tue) - business\n16 (Wed) - business\n17 (Thu) - business\n18 (Fri) - business\n19 (Sat) - not\n20 (Sun) - not\n21 (Mon) - business\n22 (Tue) - business\n23 (Wed) - business\n24 (Thu) - business\n25 (Fri) - business\n26 (Sat) - not\n27 (Sun) - not\n28 (Mon) - business\n29 (Tue) - business\n30 (Wed) - business\nDecember 1 (Thu) - business\n2 (Fri) - business\n3 (Sat) - not\n4 (Sun) - not\n5 (Mon) - business\n6 (Tue) - business\n7 (Wed) - business\n8 (Thu) - business\n9 (Fri) - business\n10 (Sat) - not\n11 (Sun) - not\n12 (Mon) - business\n13 (Tue) - business\n14 (Wed) - business\n15 (Thu) - business\n16 (Fri) - business\n\nNow, let's count all the business days.

Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1940 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1940 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1940 divided by 4. 4 times 485 is 1940, right? So 4 x 485 = 1940. That means 1940 is divisible by 4. So that's the first condition satisfied.\n\nNext, I need to check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. So 1940 divided by 100 is 19.4. Wait, that's not a whole number. So 1940 is not a century year. Therefore, the second condition about being divisible by 400 doesn't apply here because it's not a century year.\n\nSince 1940 is divisible by 4 and not a century year, it should be a leap year. Let me double-check. The rule is: if divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also by 400. Since 1940 isn't divisible by 100, it's a leap year. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be Yes.", "Yes"], [74, "Determine the day of the month for the second Tuesday in November 2022. Give the count numerically.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Tuesday would be the 1st. Then the second Tuesday would be the 8th. But wait, maybe I should check again. Let me think. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then adding 7 days would make the next Tuesday the 8th. So the second Tuesday would be the 8th. But wait, maybe I should verify this with another method. Alternatively, I can check the actual calendar for November 2022. Let me try to recall or figure out the days. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't access that, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think again. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then the first Tuesday is the 1st, the second is the 8th, third is 15th, fourth is 22nd, and fifth is 29th. So the second Tuesday would be the 8th. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another way. For example, if I know that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. Then November 1 is a Tuesday, so 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri). That seems correct. So the second Tuesday would be the 8th. Therefore, the answer should be 8. But wait, the question says to answer with -1 if the ordinal doesn't exist.

Alright, so first, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 10th. Well, from the 1st to the 10th is 9 days later, right? Because if you count from the 1st to the 2nd is one day, so adding 9 days to the 1st would get you to the 10th.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Saturday, I need to count 9 days forward. But wait, days of the week cycle every 7 days. So maybe I can divide 9 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 9 divided by 7 is 1 week with a remainder of 2 days. So that means 9 days later is the same as 1 week (which brings us back to Saturday) plus 2 more days.\n\nStarting from Saturday, adding one day would be Sunday, then adding another day would be Monday. So January 10th should be a Monday. Let me double-check that. If January 1 is Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, January 4 is Tuesday, January 5 is Wednesday, January 6 is Thursday, January 7 is Friday, January 8 is Saturday, January 9 is Sunday, and January 10 is Monday.

Hmm, first, I should figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 51 days because weeks are 7 days, so dividing 51 by 7 will give me the number of weeks and the remainder will be the extra days. Let me do that calculation.\n\n51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks with a remainder of 2 days. Because 7 times 7 is 49, and 51 minus 49 is 2. So, 51 days later is the same as 7 weeks and 2 days later. Since 7 weeks is exactly a week, the weekday will be the same as the starting day, which is Friday. Then adding 2 days to Friday. Friday plus one day is Saturday, plus another day is Sunday. So, 51 days later should be a Sunday. Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, November 11, 2022, is a Friday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think I remember that November 11, 2022, was a Friday. Let me check that again. Wait, maybe I should count the days step by step to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or some other method. But since I can't look it up, I have to rely on my calculations. So, if I start on Friday, November 11, adding 7 days would be November 18, which is also a Friday. Then adding another 7 days, November 25, Friday again. Then December 2, 2022, Friday. Then December 9, Friday. Then December 16, Friday. Then December 23, Friday. Then December 30, Friday. Wait, that's 7 weeks, so 49 days. Then adding 2 more days: December 30 (Friday) + 1 day is December 31, Saturday. Then +1 day is January 1, 2023, which is Sunday. So that matches my previous calculation.

So I need to figure out what day of the week March 14th falls on, given that January 1st is Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 14th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think we can assume it's a common year with 28 days. Then March 14th is 14 days into March.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. If January 1st is Sunday, then January 1st is day 0. So January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So to get to March 14th, I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 14th, then find the remainder when divided by 7 to determine the weekday.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 14th is 14 days into March, so total days from January 1st to March 14th is 58 + 14 = 72 days. Wait, but wait, that's not right. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is day 0, January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31. February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59, March 14th is day 59 + 13 = day 72. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 72 days. But since January 1st is Sunday, we need to find what day of the week 72 days later is.\n\nBut wait, since each week has 7 days, we can take 72 divided by 7 and find the remainder. 7*10=70, so 72-70=2. So 72 days later is 2 days after Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 days is Tuesday. So March 14th would be a Tuesday?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to day 30 + 28 = 58. Then March 14th is 14 days after February 28th. So day 58 + 14 = day 72. So 72 days after January 1st. Now, 72 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 2 days. So 10 weeks later is the same day, Sunday, plus 2 days is Tuesday. So March 14th is Tuesday. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1st as Sunday. Then January 8th is also Sunday (7 days later). January 15th is Sunday, January 22nd, January 29th. Then February 5th is Sunday. February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is Sunday. March 12th is Sunday. So March 12th is Sunday.

Let's do the division: 2098 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2098 minus 2000 is 98. 98 divided by 4 is 24.5. So 2098 divided by 4 is 524.5. Since it's not a whole number, that means 2098 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that division. Let me add 4 to 2096, which is a leap year. 2096 + 4 is 2100. So 2096 is a leap year, then 2097 is not, 2098 is not, 2099 is not, and 2100 is a century year. So 2098 is not divisible by 4, so it's definitely not a leap year. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, February 6 to Friday, March 4, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates. \n\nStarting on February 6, 2022, which is a Sunday. The end date is March 4, 2022, which is a Friday. \n\nLet me list out the dates from February 6 to March 4 and count the weekdays. But that might take too long. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and subtract the weekends.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days between February 6 and March 4, inclusive. \n\nFebruary 2022 has 28 days because 2022 is not a leap year. So from February 6 to February 28 is 28 - 6 = 22 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to add 1? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nIf I start on February 6, that's day 1. Then February 7 is day 2, and so on. So from February 6 to February 28 inclusive, how many days? February 6 to February 28 is 28 - 6 + 1 = 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total days from February 6 to March 4 inclusive is 23 + 4 = 27 days. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let's count the days in February. February 6 to February 28: 28 - 6 = 22 days, but adding 1 for the inclusive count gives 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total is 23 + 4 = 27 days. So total days between the two dates is 27 days. \n\nNow, how many of those are weekends? Let's see. The start date is Sunday, February 6. So the first day is Sunday. Then the next day, February 7 is Monday. So the weekends in this period would be Sundays and Saturdays. \n\nLet me list the dates and check which are weekends. \n\nFebruary 6: Sunday (included)\nFebruary 7: Monday\nFebruary 8: Tuesday\nFebruary 9: Wednesday\nFebruary 10: Thursday\nFebruary 11: Friday\nFebruary 12: Saturday\nFebruary 13: Sunday\nFebruary 14: Monday\nFebruary 15: Tuesday\nFebruary 16: Wednesday\nFebruary 17: Thursday\nFebruary 18: Friday\nFebruary 19: Saturday\nFebruary 20: Sunday\nFebruary 21: Monday\nFebruary 22: Tuesday\nFebruary 23: Wednesday\nFebruary 24: Thursday\nFebruary 25: Friday\nFebruary 26: Saturday\nFebruary 27: Sunday\nFebruary 28: Monday\nMarch 1: Tuesday\nMarch 2: Wednesday\nMarch 3: Thursday\nMarch 4: Friday\n\nNow, let's count the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this list. \n\nSundays: February 6, 13, 20, 27. That's 4 Sundays. \n\nSaturdays: February 12, 19, 26. That's 3 Saturdays. \n\nTotal weekends: 4 + 3 = 7 days. \n\nSo total weekdays would be total days (27) minus weekends (7) = 20 weekdays. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the weekdays directly. \n\nFrom the list above, the weekdays are all days except the Saturdays and Sundays. Let's count them:\n\nFebruary 6 (Sunday) is excluded. Then:\n\nFebruary 7 (Mon) - yes\n8 (Tue) - yes\n9 (Wed) - yes\n10 (Thu) - yes\n11 (Fri) - yes\n12 (Sat) - no\n13 (Sun) - no\n14 (Mon) - yes\n15 (Tue) - yes\n16 (Wed) - yes\n17 (Thu) - yes\n18 (Fri) - yes\n19 (Sat) - no\n20 (Sun) - no\n21 (Mon) - yes\n22 (Tue) - yes\n23 (Wed) - yes\n24 (Thu) - yes\n25 (Fri) - yes\n26 (Sat) - no\n27 (Sun) - no\n28 (Mon) - yes\nMarch 1 (Tue) - yes\n2 (Wed) - yes\n3 (Thu) - yes\n4 (Fri) - yes\n\nNow, let's count these. Let's go step by step:\n\nFrom February 7 to February 11: 5 days (Mon-Fri)\nThen February 14-18: 5 days (Mon-Fri)\nFebruary 21-25: 5 days (Mon-Fri)\nFebruary 28: 1 day (Mon)\nMarch 1-4: 4 days (Tue-Fri)\n\nSo that's 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 20 days. \n\nYes, that matches the previous calculation.

So first, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those days are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates or find the first and last day of the week in that range. Let me start by checking what day of the week June 12, 2022 was. The problem says it's a Sunday. So June 12 is Sunday. Then June 13 is Monday. So the first Monday in the period is June 13.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many Mondays are there until July 28. Let me figure out the total number of days between June 12 and July 28, inclusive. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, June has 30 days. So from June 12 to June 30, that's 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you include both start and end dates, the formula is end - start + 1. So June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then July has 31 days, but we need up to July 28. So July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total days from June 12 to July 28 inclusive is 19 + 28 = 47 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, June 12 to June 30 is 19 days (since June 12 is day 1, June 13 is day 2, ..., June 30 is day 19). Then July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total is 19 + 28 = 47 days. So the total number of days is 47.\n\nNow, if there are 47 days in total, how many Mondays are there? Well, since the first day is Sunday (June 12), the next day is Monday (June 13). So the first Monday is day 2. Then every 7 days after that. So the Mondays would be on days 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51... Wait, but the total days are only 47. So let's list them:\n\nStarting from June 13 (Monday) as day 1, then adding 7 days each time. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the first Monday being day 1 (June 13), then day 8 (June 20), day 15 (June 27), day 22 (July 4), day 29 (July 11), day 36 (July 18), day 43 (July 25). Then the next one would be day 50 (August 1), which is outside the range. So how many Mondays are there?\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. June 13\n2. June 20\n3. June 27\n4. July 4\n5. July 11\n6. July 18\n7. July 25\n\nThat's 7 Mondays. Wait, but let me check if July 25 is within the range. The end date is July 28. Yes, July 25 is included. So that's 7 Mondays. But wait, let me check the total days again. If the total days are 47, then 47 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 5 days. So there should be 6 full weeks (42 days) plus 5 days. Since the first day is Sunday, the first 42 days would include 6 Mondays (since the first day is Sunday, the first Monday is day 2, then day 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44. Wait, 44 is within 42 days? Wait, 42 days would be 6 weeks. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, since the first day is Sunday (June 12), then the next day is Monday (June 13). So the first Monday is day 1 (June 13), then day 8 (June 20), day 15 (June 27), day 22 (July 4), day 29 (July 11), day 36 (July 18), day 43 (July 25). Then day 50 would be August 1. So in the 47 days, the last Monday is July 25 (day 43). Then the next one is day 50, which is outside. So that's 7 Mondays. But wait, let me check the dates again.\n\nJune 13 is Monday. Then adding 7 days: June 20, 27. Then July 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 7 Mondays. So that's correct. So the answer should be 7. But wait, let me check if July 25 is within the range.

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me start by checking the dates. January 24, 2022 is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think January 24, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me check that. Well, if I remember correctly, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So adding 23 days to that would be January 24. Let's count: 23 days later. Since 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday plus 2 days is Monday. Yes, that's correct. So January 24 is a Monday.\n\nNow, the end date is March 22, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let me check that. Let's see, March 22, 2022. If I know that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then March 22 would be 21 days later. 21 days is exactly 3 weeks, so March 22 would also be a Tuesday. Wait, but that might not be correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or some method to count the days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days from January 24 to March 22 inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 24 to January 31 is 31 - 24 + 1 = 8 days (including both start and end). Wait, no. Wait, if you have from day X to day Y inclusive, the number of days is Y - X + 1. So January 24 to January 31 is 31 - 24 + 1 = 8 days. Then February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. So total days would be 8 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 22 (Mar) = 58 days. Wait, but that's the total number of days from January 24 to March 22 inclusive. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, January 24 to January 31: 31 - 24 = 7 days, plus 1 day (inclusive) is 8 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. So 8 + 28 + 22 = 58 days total. So there are 58 days in total between those two dates, inclusive.\n\nNow, out of these 58 days, how many are weekends? Let's find the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nSince January 24 is a Monday, the next day, January 25 is Tuesday, and so on. Let's see the first week: January 24 (Monday) to January 28 (Friday). Then January 29 is Saturday, January 30 is Sunday, January 31 is Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday, and so on.\n\nSo in the first week (Jan 24-28), there are 5 business days (Mon-Fri). Then the next days: Jan 29 (Sat), Jan 30 (Sun), Jan 31 (Mon). So in the first week, the weekends are Jan 29 and 30. Then in February, each week has 2 weekends (Sat and Sun). Then March 1 is a Tuesday, so March 1 is Tuesday, March 2 is Wednesday, March 3 is Thursday, March 4 is Friday, March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo to find the number of weekends, we can calculate how many full weeks there are in the total days and then add the remaining days.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in the period.\n\nAlternatively, since the total days are 58, and each week has 2 weekend days (Sat and Sun), the number of weekends would be (number of weeks) * 2, plus any extra days that are weekends.\n\nBut first, let's find how many weeks and extra days are in 58 days. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 2 days. Because 8*7=56, so 58-56=2 days. So there are 8 full weeks and 2 extra days.\n\nIn each full week, there are 2 weekend days. So 8 weeks * 2 = 16 weekend days. Then the remaining 2 days are the next two days after the 56th day. Since the first day is a Monday (Jan 24), the 56th day would be 56 days later. Let's see: 56 days is exactly 8 weeks, so the 56th day would be a Monday again (since each week starts on Monday). Then the 57th day is Tuesday, and the 58th day is Wednesday. So the extra two days are Tuesday and Wednesday. These are both business days, so no weekends here. Therefore, total weekend days are 16.\n\nTherefore, the number of business days is total days (58) minus weekend days (16) = 42.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because if the first day is Monday, then the first week (days 1-7) would be Mon to Sun. Wait, but the first day is Monday, so the first week is Jan 24 (Mon) to Jan 30 (Sun). Wait, but that's 7 days. Then the next week would be Jan 31 (Mon) to Feb 6 (Sun), and so on. Wait, but the total days are 58. So 58 days would be 8 weeks (56 days) plus 2 days. So the 56 days would be 8 weeks, and the 57th and 58th days would be the next two days after the 56th day. Since the 56th day is a Monday (as 56 is 8 weeks), then day 57 is Tuesday, day 58 is Wednesday. So those two days are business days. Therefore, the weekends are only in the 8 weeks, which is 16 days. So total business days would be 58 - 16 = 42. But wait, that seems low. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me recount the days from Jan 24 to March 22 inclusive.\n\nJanuary 24 to January 31: 8 days (as before). Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. So 8 + 28 + 22 = 58 days. That's correct.\n\nBut let's check another way. Let's use an online calendar or a date calculator. Wait, since I can't do that, I need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of weekends in each month.\n\nStarting with January. January 24 is Monday. The first weekend in January would be January 29 (Saturday) and 30 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is February 5 (Saturday) and 6 (Sunday), then February 12, 13; 19, 20; 26, 27. Then March 4, 5; 11, 12; 18, 19; 25, 26. Wait, but March 22 is the end date. So March 22 is Tuesday. So the weekends in March would be March 4, 5 (but March 4 is a Saturday, March 5 is Sunday), then March 11, 12, 18, 19, 25, 26. But since the end date is March 22, which is Tuesday, the last weekend in March would be March 25 and 26, but those are after March 22. So in March, only the first weekend (March 4-5) is within the period? Wait, no. Wait, March 1 is a Tuesday. So March 4 is Saturday, March 5 is Sunday. Then March 11 is Saturday, March 12 is Sunday. March 18 is Saturday, March 19 is Sunday. March 25 is Saturday, March 26 is Sunday. But since the end date is March 22, which is Tuesday, the weekends in March would be March 4, 5, 11, 12, 18, 19. But March 25 and 26 are after March 22, so they are not included. So in March, there are 4 weekends (each weekend is two days, so 4 weekends would be 8 days, but wait, March 4-5 is one weekend, 11-12 another, 18-19 another, and 25-26 another. But since March 22 is the end date, the last weekend in March is March 18-19. So that's three weekends in March (March 4-5, 11-12, 18-19). So that's 3 weekends, 6 days. Then in February, how many weekends? February has 28 days. Let's see. February 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend in February is February 5 (Saturday) and 6 (Sunday). Then 12, 13; 19, 20; 26, 27. So that's four weekends in February (each two days), so 4*2=8 days. Then in January, the first weekend is January 29 and 30 (two days). So total weekends would be 2 (Jan) + 8 (Feb) + 6 (Mar) = 16 days. Which matches the previous calculation. So total weekends are 16. Therefore, business days are 58 - 16 = 42. So the answer should be 42.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let's count the number of weekends in each month.\n\nJanuary: 29 and 30 (2 days)\nFebruary: 5,6; 12,13; 19,20; 26,27 (4 weekends, 8 days)\nMarch: 4,5; 11,12; 18,19 (3 weekends, 6 days)\nTotal: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16.

I need to find out what day of the week it is 99 days after Monday, December 26, 2022. Hmm, first, I should figure out the date 99 days later. But maybe there's a smarter way than counting each day. Wait, since the question is about the weekday, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. \n\nI remember that each week has 7 days, so the weekday will repeat every 7 days. So if I divide 99 by 7, the remainder will tell me how many days ahead I need to go from Monday. Let me do that calculation. 99 divided by 7 is 14 weeks with a remainder of 1, because 14 times 7 is 98, and 99 minus 98 is 1. So the remainder is 1. That means 99 days later is 1 day after Monday. \n\nWait, but wait. If the starting day is Monday, then adding 1 day would be Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday? But wait, maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the date? Wait, December 26, 2022, is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Let me think. December 26, 2022. Let me check if that's correct. Wait, I think that's right. But maybe I should verify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's see. Starting from December 26, 2022 (Monday). Let's count 99 days. But that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. So adding 14 weeks (98 days) would bring me back to the same day, Monday. Then adding 1 more day would be Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if the 99th day is actually 1 day after. Let me think. If I start on day 0 as Monday, then day 1 is Tuesday, day 2 Wednesday, etc. So 99 days later would be day 99. Since 99 mod 7 is 1, that would be 1 day after Monday, which is Tuesday. So that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with a calendar. Let me try to count. December has 31 days. So December 26 is day 0. Then December 27 is +1, ..., December 31 is +5. Then January 1 is +6, January 2 is +7, etc. But this might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online tool or a formula. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. \n\nAnother way: 99 divided by 7 is 14.142... So 14 weeks is 98 days. So 98 days later is the same day, Monday. Then 99 days later is one day after Monday, which is Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday. \n\nI think that's correct.

I need to count the number of weekdays between Thursday, September 15 and Saturday, November 26, 2022, including both dates. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day.\n\nWait, maybe I can break it down into months. Let's start with September. September 15 is a Thursday. Let me check the days in September. September has 30 days. So from September 15 to September 30, that's 16 days (including both start and end). But I need to count only the weekdays in that period.\n\nWait, September 15 is Thursday. Let's list the days:\n\nSeptember 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri). So from 15 to 30, that's 16 days. Now, how many weekdays are there here?\n\nFrom 15 (Thu) to 30 (Fri). Let's count the weekdays:\n\nThu (15), Fri (16), Mon (19), Tue (20), Wed (21), Thu (22), Fri (23), Mon (26), Tue (27), Wed (28), Thu (29), Fri (30). Wait, that's 12 weekdays. Wait, let me check again. Let's list each day:\n\n15: Thu (weekday)\n16: Fri (weekday)\n17: Sat (weekend)\n18: Sun (weekend)\n19: Mon (weekday)\n20: Tue (weekday)\n21: Wed (weekday)\n22: Thu (weekday)\n23: Fri (weekday)\n24: Sat (weekend)\n25: Sun (weekend)\n26: Mon (weekday)\n27: Tue (weekday)\n28: Wed (weekday)\n29: Thu (weekday)\n30: Fri (weekday)\n\nSo from 15 to 30, that's 16 days. The weekends are 17,18,24,25. So 4 weekends. So weekdays would be 16 - 4 = 12. So September has 12 weekdays.\n\nNow moving to October. October has 31 days. Let's check the days. October 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, let me confirm that. Wait, September 15 is Thursday. Let me check the day of the week for October 1. September has 30 days, so September 30 is a Friday. Then October 1 is a Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is a weekend. Let's count the weekdays in October.\n\nOctober has 31 days. Let's count the number of weeks. October 1 is Saturday, so the first week has 1 weekend (Sat and Sun). Then the rest of the days. Let's see:\n\nFrom October 1 (Sat) to October 31 (Mon). Wait, October 31 is a Monday? Let me check. Let's count the days. October 1 is Saturday. October 2 is Sunday. October 3 is Monday. So October 3 is Monday. Then October 31 is 28 days later. 28 days is 4 weeks, so October 31 would be the same day as October 3, which is Monday. So October 31 is Monday. So October has 31 days, ending on Monday.\n\nSo in October, the weekends are Saturdays and Sundays. Let's count how many Saturdays and Sundays there are in October.\n\nOctober 1 is Saturday. Then each week has one Saturday and one Sunday. October has 31 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 full weeks (28 days) plus 3 days (October 29, 30, 31). So in the 4 weeks, there are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. Then the remaining 3 days are October 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon). So that adds one more Saturday and one more Sunday. So total Saturdays: 4 + 1 = 5. Sundays: 4 + 1 = 5. So total weekends in October are 5 + 5 = 10 days. Therefore, the number of weekdays in October is 31 - 10 = 21 days.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because October 1 is Saturday, so the first week has Saturday (1) and Sunday (2). Then the next week starts on October 3 (Monday). So the 4 weeks would be from October 3 to October 28 (4 weeks, 28 days). Then the remaining days are October 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon). So that's 3 days. So in total, the number of Saturdays is 5 (October 1, 8, 15, 22, 29) and Sundays are 5 (October 2, 9, 16, 23, 30). So that's 5 + 5 = 10 weekends. So 31 - 10 = 21 weekdays. So October has 21 weekdays.\n\nNow moving to November. November 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me check that. October 31 is Monday, so November 1 is Tuesday. November has 30 days. The end date is November 26, which is a Saturday. So we need to count from November 1 (Tue) to November 26 (Sat), inclusive.\n\nSo November has 30 days. Let's count the number of weekdays in November from 1 to 26. Wait, but the end date is November 26, which is Saturday. So we need to include that.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many weekends are in November from 1 to 26. Let's list the days. November 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend is November 5 (Saturday) and 6 (Sunday). Then each week after that. Let's see:\n\nNovember 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), etc.\n\nSo the weekends in November are Saturdays and Sundays. Let's count how many Saturdays and Sundays are between November 1 and November 26.\n\nFirst, November 1 is Tuesday. Let's find the first Saturday. November 5 is Saturday. Then each week after that. The last Saturday before November 26 is November 25 (since November 26 is Saturday). Wait, November 26 is Saturday. So the weekends in November from 1 to 26 are:\n\nSaturdays: 5, 12, 19, 26. That's 4 Saturdays.\n\nSundays: 6, 13, 20, 27. But November 27 is beyond our end date (26), so only 6, 13, 20. That's 3 Sundays.\n\nSo total weekends in November from 1 to 26: 4 + 3 = 7 days. Therefore, the number of weekdays is 26 days (from 1 to 26) minus 7 weekends = 19 weekdays. Wait, but wait. Wait, November 1 to November 26 is 26 days. Let me check that. November 1 is day 1, November 26 is day 26. So 26 days total. So 26 - 7 = 19 weekdays.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let's list the days:\n\nFrom November 1 (Tue) to November 26 (Sat). Let's count the weekdays:\n\nTues (1), Wed (2), Thurs (3), Fri (4), Sat (5) is weekend. So first week: 1-4 are weekdays (4 days), 5 is weekend. Then next week: 6 (Sun, weekend), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat, weekend). So from 7-11: 7,8,9,10,11 (5 weekdays). Then 12 is weekend. Then 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat). So 14-18: 5 weekdays. Then 19 is weekend. Then 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat). So 21-25: 5 weekdays. Then 26 is weekend. So total weekdays: 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19. Yes, that's correct. So November has 19 weekdays.\n\nSo adding up the three months: September (12) + October (21) + November (19) = 12 + 21 is 33, plus 19 is 52. Wait, but wait. Wait, the end date is November 26, which is included. But in November, we counted up to 26. So that's correct. So total weekdays would be 12 + 21 + 19 = 52?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the counts. Let me verify each month again.\n\nSeptember: 12 weekdays. October: 21. November: 19. Total 52. But let me check another way. Let's calculate the total number of days between September 15 and November 26, inclusive, then subtract the number of weekends.\n\nFirst, calculate the total days. From September 15 to September 30: 16 days. October has 31 days. November 1 to November 26 is 26 days. So total days: 16 + 31 + 26 = 73 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, September 15 to September 30 is 16 days (including both). Then October is 31 days. Then November 1 to November 26 is 26 days. So total days is 16 + 31 + 26 = 73 days. But if I calculate the total days between September 15 and November 26 inclusive, that's 73 days. Now, how many weekends are in those 73 days?\n\nIf I can find the number of weekends, then subtract that from 73 to get the number of weekdays.\n\nBut how many weekends are there? Let's see. Let's check the first day, September 15 is Thursday. Let's find the total number of weekends in the period.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the previous counts. September had 4 weekends (17,18,24,25). October had 10 weekends (5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays). November had 7 weekends (4 Saturdays and 3 Sundays). So total weekends: 4 + 10 + 7 = 21. So total weekdays would be 73 - 21 = 52. Which matches the previous total. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 52.", "52"], [74, "Is 2055 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2055 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2055. First, divide 2055 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2055 minus 2000 is 55. 55 divided by 4 is 13.75. So 2055 divided by 4 is 513.75. That means 2055 is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check again. Let me add 4 to 2055: 2055 + 4 is 2059. So 2055 is not a multiple of 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, since it's not divisible by 4, it can't be a leap year. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm. 2055 divided by 4: 4 times 500 is 2000, 4 times 513 is 2052. 2052 plus 4 is 2056. So 2055 is between 2052 and 2056. So yes, 2055 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it's not a leap year. Also, even if it were a century year, which it isn't because it ends with 55, not 00, so it's not a century year. So the second condition doesn't apply here. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [74, "Count forward 46 days from Wednesday, February 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 46 days after Wednesday, February 2, 2022. Hmm, so first, I should figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 46 days because weeks repeat every 7 days. \n\nSo, 46 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 6 is 42, which leaves a remainder of 4. So 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days. Since 6 weeks later would be the same day of the week, adding 4 days to Wednesday should give me the answer.\n\nStarting from Wednesday, adding 1 day is Thursday, 2 days is Friday, 3 days is Saturday, and 4 days is Sunday. Wait, so that would make the 46th day a Sunday? Let me double-check. Maybe I should count each day step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or check the actual dates. But since I don't have a calendar here, I need to rely on the math. Let's confirm the remainder again. 46 divided by 7 is 6 with a remainder of 4. So adding 4 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday. Yeah, that seems right.

Reply with the numerical value.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, December 4, 2022, to Saturday, January 14, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates. Wait, the start date is Sunday, December 4, 2022, and the end date is Saturday, January 14, 2022. Wait, but January 14 is after December 4, so the period is from December 4 to January 14. But I need to make sure that the dates are correct. Let me confirm the actual dates.\n\nWait, December 4, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me check that. Let me think: December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. So December 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday, 4 is Sunday. Yes, that's correct. Then January 14, 2022. Wait, but wait, 2022 is a leap year? No, 2022 is not a leap year. February had 28 days. So January 14, 2022 would be... Let me check. Let's count the days from December 4 to January 14.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to break it down into months. From December 4 to December 31, then January 1 to January 14.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of days between December 4 and December 31, inclusive. Then add the days from January 1 to January 14, inclusive. But need to check if those dates are correct.\n\nWait, but the start date is Sunday, December 4, and the end date is Saturday, January 14. So the period includes both dates. So I need to count all the days from Dec 4 to Jan 14, inclusive, and then subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut first, let's find the total number of days between Dec 4 and Jan 14, inclusive. Let's calculate that.\n\nDecember has 31 days. So from Dec 4 to Dec 31 is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days. Wait, because inclusive. So Dec 4 is day 1, Dec 5 is day 2, ..., Dec 31 is day 28. Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total days would be 28 + 14 = 42 days. But wait, that's if the dates are consecutive. Wait, but Dec 4 to Dec 31 is 28 days? Let me check again. From Dec 4 to Dec 31: 31 - 4 = 27 days, plus 1 for inclusive, so 28 days. Then Jan 1 to Jan 14 is 14 days. So total is 28 + 14 = 42 days. So total days between Dec 4 and Jan 14 inclusive is 42 days.\n\nNow, out of these 42 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nSo I need to figure out how many Saturdays and Sundays are in this period.\n\nFirst, let's note that Dec 4 is a Sunday. So Dec 4 is Sunday, Dec 5 is Monday, Dec 6 is Tuesday, Dec 7 is Wednesday, Dec 8 is Thursday, Dec 9 is Friday, Dec 10 is Saturday, Dec 11 is Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo let's list the weekends in December and January.\n\nStarting with December:\n\nDec 4: Sunday (start date)\nDec 5: Monday\nDec 6: Tuesday\nDec 7: Wednesday\nDec 8: Thursday\nDec 9: Friday\nDec 10: Saturday\nDec 11: Sunday\nDec 12: Monday\nDec 13: Tuesday\nDec 14: Wednesday\nDec 15: Thursday\nDec 16: Friday\nDec 17: Saturday\nDec 18: Sunday\nDec 19: Monday\nDec 20: Tuesday\nDec 21: Wednesday\nDec 22: Thursday\nDec 23: Friday\nDec 24: Saturday\nDec 25: Sunday\nDec 26: Monday\nDec 27: Tuesday\nDec 28: Wednesday\nDec 29: Thursday\nDec 30: Friday\nDec 31: Saturday\n\nSo in December, the weekends are:\n\nDec 4 (Sunday), Dec 10 (Saturday), Dec 11 (Sunday), Dec 17 (Saturday), Dec 18 (Sunday), Dec 24 (Saturday), Dec 25 (Sunday), Dec 31 (Saturday). Wait, let me count again.\n\nWait, Dec 4 is Sunday. Then the next Saturday is Dec 10. Then Sunday Dec 11. Then Saturday Dec 17, Sunday Dec 18. Then Saturday Dec 24, Sunday Dec 25. Then Saturday Dec 31. So that's 8 weekends in December. Let me count them:\n\n1. Dec 4 (Sunday)\n2. Dec 10 (Saturday)\n3. Dec 11 (Sunday)\n4. Dec 17 (Saturday)\n5. Dec 18 (Sunday)\n6. Dec 24 (Saturday)\n7. Dec 25 (Sunday)\n8. Dec 31 (Saturday)\n\nYes, 8 weekends in December. So that's 8 days.\n\nNow, January 1 to January 14. Let's check the days. January 1, 2022 was a Saturday? Wait, let me check. Wait, December 31, 2022 was a Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is a Sunday. Wait, because December 31 is Saturday, so January 1 is Sunday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, if Dec 4 is Sunday, then Dec 31 is Saturday. So Jan 1 is Sunday. So January 1 is Sunday. Then January 2 is Monday, 3 is Tuesday, 4 is Wednesday, 5 is Thursday, 6 is Friday, 7 is Saturday, 8 is Sunday, 9 is Monday, 10 is Tuesday, 11 is Wednesday, 12 is Thursday, 13 is Friday, 14 is Saturday.\n\nSo in January, the weekends are:\n\nJan 1 (Sunday), Jan 7 (Saturday), Jan 8 (Sunday), Jan 14 (Saturday). So that's 4 weekends in January.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period are 8 (December) + 4 (January) = 12 days.\n\nSo total days is 42, subtract 12 weekends, so 42 - 12 = 30 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nWait, in December, the weekends are 8 days. Let me check again:\n\nDec 4 (Sunday), Dec 10 (Saturday), Dec 11 (Sunday), Dec 17 (Saturday), Dec 18 (Sunday), Dec 24 (Saturday), Dec 25 (Sunday), Dec 31 (Saturday). That's 8 days. Correct.\n\nIn January, Jan 1 (Sunday), Jan 7 (Saturday), Jan 8 (Sunday), Jan 14 (Saturday). That's 4 days. So total 12 weekends. So 42 total days minus 12 weekends equals 30 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check the total days again. From Dec 4 to Dec 31 is 28 days. Then Jan 1 to Jan 14 is 14 days. 28 + 14 = 42. Correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check the actual dates again. Let me check the days in December and January.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's count the number of Mondays to Fridays in each month.\n\nStarting with December 4, 2022 (Sunday). So the first day is Sunday. So the first business day is Monday, Dec 5. Then the last day is Saturday, Jan 14. So the last business day is Friday, Jan 13? Wait, no. Wait, the end date is Saturday, Jan 14. So the period includes Saturday, Jan 14. So the last day is Saturday, Jan 14. So the business days would be up to Friday, Jan 14? No, because the end date is inclusive. So if the end date is Saturday, Jan 14, then that Saturday is included. But since it's a weekend, it's not a business day. So the last business day would be Friday, Jan 13. Wait, but maybe I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should list all the dates and count the business days. But that would take time. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again. From Dec 4 to Dec 31: 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days. Then Jan 1 to Jan 14 is 14 days. So total 28 + 14 = 42 days. Correct.\n\nNow, the weekends are 12 days. So 42 - 12 = 30. So the answer is 30?\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the number of business days in December and January.\n\nIn December, starting from Dec 4 (Sunday) to Dec 31 (Saturday). So the business days in December would be from Dec 5 (Monday) to Dec 31 (Saturday). Wait, but Dec 31 is Saturday, which is a weekend. So the business days in December would be from Dec 5 (Monday) to Dec 30 (Friday), and then Dec 31 is Saturday (non-business). Wait, but Dec 4 is included as the start date. Wait, the original question says inclusive of both dates. So Dec 4 is included. But Dec 4 is a Sunday, which is not a business day. So the business days in December would be from Dec 5 (Monday) to Dec 31 (Saturday), but excluding the weekends. Wait, but Dec 31 is Saturday, which is a weekend. So the business days in December would be:\n\nFrom Dec 5 (Monday) to Dec 30 (Friday). Let's count how many days that is. Dec 5 to Dec 30 is 30 - 5 + 1 = 26 days. But that includes all the days from Monday to Friday. Wait, but how many weeks are there?\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of weeks. From Dec 5 (Monday) to Dec 30 (Friday). Let's see:\n\nDec 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri) \u2013 that's 5 days.\n\nThen Dec 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri) \u2013 another 5 days.\n\nDec 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nDec 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nThat's 4 weeks (20 days) plus 5 days, total 25 days? Wait, 5 days x 4 weeks is 20, plus 5 days is 25. Wait, but Dec 5 to Dec 30 is 26 days. Wait, maybe I'm missing a day. Let me check:\n\nDec 5 to Dec 30: 30 - 5 = 25 days, plus 1 is 26 days. So if I have 4 weeks (20 days) and 6 days, that's 26 days. Wait, maybe I need to recount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the number of business days in December. Since Dec 4 is Sunday, the first business day is Dec 5 (Monday). The last business day in December is Dec 30 (Friday), because Dec 31 is Saturday. So from Dec 5 to Dec 30, how many business days?\n\nEach week has 5 business days. Let's see how many weeks are between Dec 5 and Dec 30.\n\nDec 5 is Monday. Dec 12 is Monday. Dec 19 is Monday. Dec 26 is Monday. Dec 30 is Friday. So from Dec 5 to Dec 26 is 4 weeks (20 days). Then Dec 27 is Monday, 28 Tuesday, 29 Wednesday, 30 Thursday, 31 Friday. Wait, but Dec 30 is Friday. Wait, Dec 26 is Monday, so Dec 27 is Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. So that's 5 days. So total business days in December would be 4 weeks (20 days) + 5 days = 25 days. But wait, Dec 5 to Dec 30 is 26 days. But if there are 25 business days, that would mean 26 - 25 = 1 weekend day. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of weekends in December. Earlier I said there are 8 weekends. So 8 days. So total days in December from Dec 4 to Dec 31 is 28 days. So business days would be 28 - 8 = 20 days. But that contradicts the previous count. Wait, but if Dec 4 is included, which is a Sunday, and Dec 31 is a Saturday. So the total days is 28. If there are 8 weekends, then business days are 20. But earlier when I tried to count from Dec 5 to Dec 30, I thought it was 25 days. That must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the total days from Dec 4 to Dec 31 is 28 days. If there are 8 weekend days, then business days are 28 - 8 = 20. So that would mean that in December, there are 20 business days. Then in January, from Jan 1 to Jan 14, which is 14 days. How many weekends are there in January? Earlier I said 4. So business days would be 14 - 4 = 10. So total business days would be 20 + 10 = 30. Which matches the previous calculation. So that seems correct.\n\nBut why did I get confused when trying to count from Dec 5 to Dec 30? Because maybe I was including Dec 30 as part of the business days. Let me check again. If Dec 4 is Sunday, then Dec 5 is Monday. The last business day in December is Dec 30 (Friday). So from Dec 5 to Dec 30 is 26 days. But if there are 8 weekend days in the entire December period (Dec 4 to Dec 31), then the business days would be 28 - 8 = 20. So that would mean that from Dec 5 to Dec 30, there are 20 business days. But that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the 8 weekend days include Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 31 (Saturday). So the business days from Dec 5 to Dec 30 would be 20 days. But how?\n\nWait, if Dec 4 is Sunday, and Dec 31 is Saturday, then the total days is 28. The weekends are 8 days. So business days are 20. So from Dec 5 to Dec 30 is 26 days. But 26 days minus 8 weekend days would be 18 business days. But that doesn't add up. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me list all the dates from Dec 4 to Dec 31 and count the business days.\n\nDec 4: Sunday (non-business)\nDec 5: Monday (business)\nDec 6: Tuesday (business)\nDec 7: Wednesday (business)\nDec 8: Thursday (business)\nDec 9: Friday (business)\nDec 10: Saturday (non-business)\nDec 11: Sunday (non-business)\nDec 12: Monday (business)\nDec 13: Tuesday (business)\nDec 14: Wednesday (business)\nDec 15: Thursday (business)\nDec 16: Friday (business)\nDec 17: Saturday (non-business)\nDec 18: Sunday (non-business)\nDec 19: Monday (business)\nDec 20: Tuesday (business)\nDec 21: Wednesday (business)\nDec 22: Thursday (business)\nDec 23: Friday (business)\nDec 24: Saturday (non-business)\nDec 25: Sunday (non-business)\nDec 26: Monday (business)\nDec 27: Tuesday (business)\nDec 28: Wednesday (business)\nDec 29: Thursday (business)\nDec 30: Friday (business)\nDec 31: Saturday (non-business)\n\nNow, let's count the business days in December. From Dec 5 to Dec 30, excluding the weekends. Let's count each day:\n\nDec 5: 1\nDec 6: 2\nDec 7: 3\nDec 8: 4\nDec 9: 5\nDec 10: non\nDec 11: non\nDec 12: 6\nDec 13: 7\nDec 14: 8\nDec 15: 9"], [74, "On which weekday did June 26, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 26, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2022 would be a year later, so adding 365 days. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on a Saturday, then 2022 would start on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. \n\nNow, I need to find June 26. Let me count the days from January 1 to June 26. Let's break it down month by month. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days in 2022 because it's not a leap year. March has 31, April 30, May 31, and then June 26. \n\nSo adding up the days: \n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 31 days\nJune: 26 days (up to June 26)\n\nWait, but if I'm starting from January 1, then the total days from January 1 to June 26 would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 26 (June). Let me add those up step by step.\n\n31 + 28 is 59. Then 59 + 31 is 90. 90 + 30 is 120. 120 + 31 is 151. Then 151 + 26 is 177 days. So June 26 is 177 days after January 1, 2022. \n\nNow, since January 1 is a Sunday, I need to find what day of the week 177 days later is. Since each week has 7 days, I can divide 177 by 7 and find the remainder. \n\n177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 2 days. Because 25*7 is 175, so 177-175 is 2. So 2 days after Sunday is Monday. Wait, but wait, if January 1 is Sunday, then adding 1 day would be Monday, adding 2 days would be Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean June 26 is a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let me check a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if that's the case, then maybe I can count backwards. Let's see. July 4 is Monday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is 6 days before July 4. So June 30 would be a Friday. Then June 26 is 4 days before June 30. So June 26 would be a Monday? Wait, that contradicts my previous answer. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the day count. Let me check again. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday. Because July 4 is 3 days after July 1. So July 1 is Friday. Then June 30 is the day before July 1, so June 30 is Thursday. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, maybe I need to check this again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use an online calendar or a different approach. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try again. \n\nIf January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then let's count the days step by step. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday again, and so on. Let's find the day of the week for June 26. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 is the same as June 26, 2023, but that might not help. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that I know some other dates. For example, I remember that June 10, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 16 days to June 10 would get to June 26. 16 days later. 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Friday plus 2 days is Sunday. Wait, but that would mean June 26 is a Sunday? But that contradicts the previous calculation. \n\nHmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to check my initial assumption about January 1, 2022. Let me verify that. \n\nI think that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me think about some other dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2022 is one year later. Since 2022 is not a leap year, 365 days later. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on Saturday, then 2022 starts on Sunday. So that part is correct. \n\nSo January 1, 2022 is Sunday. Then, let's count the days from January 1 to June 26. \n\nJanuary: 31 days. So January 1 is day 0 (Sunday). Then January 2 is day 1 (Monday), etc. \n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the number of days from January 1 to June 26. Let me add them again:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 31 days\nJune: 26 days\n\nTotal: 31 + 28 = 59; 59 + 31 = 90; 90 + 30 = 120; 120 + 31 = 151; 151 + 26 = 177 days. So 177 days after January 1, 2022. \n\nNow, 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 2 days. So 25 weeks is 175 days, so 177 days is 25 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 is Tuesday. So June 26 would be a Tuesday. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought July 4 was a Monday, I thought June 26 was a Monday. That must be wrong. Let me check that again. \n\nIf July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday (since July 4 is 3 days after July 1). Then June 30 is the day before July 1, so June 30 is Thursday. Then June 26 is 4 days before June 30. So June 26 would be Thursday minus 4 days. Thursday minus 1 day is Wednesday, minus 2 is Tuesday, minus 3 is Monday, minus 4 is Sunday. Wait, that would mean June 26 is Sunday. But that contradicts the previous calculation. \n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct? \n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that July 4, 2022 is a Monday is wrong. Let me try to check that. \n\nIf January 1, 2022 is Sunday, then let's count the days to July 4. \n\nJanuary has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 4. \n\nSo from January 1 to July 4 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +4=185 days. \n\nSo 185 days after January 1, 2022. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So 26 weeks is 182 days, so 185 days is 26 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Sunday: Sunday + 1 is Monday, +2 Tuesday, +3 Wednesday. So July 4 would be a Wednesday. But that contradicts my previous thought that it was a Monday. So that must mean my earlier assumption was wrong. \n\nSo if July 4 is a Wednesday, then June 30 is the day before July 1. July 1 is 3 days after July 4, which would be Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday. Wait, no. Wait, July 4 is Wednesday. July 1 is 3 days before July 4. So July 1 is Wednesday minus 3 days. Wednesday minus 1 day is Tuesday, minus 2 is Monday, minus 3 is Sunday. So July 1 is Sunday. Then June 30 is the day before, which is Saturday. Then June 26 is 4 days before June 30. So June 26 would be Saturday minus 4 days. Saturday minus 1 is Friday, minus 2 is Thursday, minus 3 is Wednesday, minus 4 is Tuesday. So June 26 is Tuesday. That matches the first calculation. \n\nSo that seems to confirm that June 26 is a Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Name the day of the week for 06/29/2022.

Hmm, I remember that sometimes people use online calendars or phone apps to check this, but since I can't do that right now, I have to figure it out another way.\n\nFirst, maybe I can recall some known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should check a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each year has 365 days, which is 52 weeks plus 1 day. So, if I know the day of the week for a certain date in 2021, I can add one day to get the same date in 2022. But I don't remember the day for June 29, 2021. Maybe that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday. Let me count backwards. July 1 is Friday, so June 30 would be Thursday. Then June 29 would be Wednesday. Wait, but that would mean June 29, 2022 is a Wednesday. But I'm not sure if July 4 is actually a Monday. Maybe I should verify that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Maybe I should use a different method. Let's try using the concept of Zeller's Congruence or some other algorithm. But I might not remember the exact formula. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know some dates in 2022.\n\nWait, I think that June 29, 2022 was a Wednesday. But I need to be sure. Let me think of another way. For example, if I know that June 27, 2022 was a Monday, then June 28 would be Tuesday, June 29 would be Wednesday. But how do I know that June 27 was a Monday? Maybe I can check another date. For example, July 1, 2022 was a Friday. So July 1 is Friday, then June 30 is Thursday, June 29 is Wednesday. That seems to align. So if July 1 is Friday, then June 29 is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be Wednesday.", "Wednesday"], [74, "What day of the week was May 31, 2022? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week May 31, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2022 would be a Sunday? Wait, no, because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be one day later than 2021. So if 2021 started on a Saturday, then 2022 would start on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 is a Sunday. \n\nNow, I need to find out what day May 31 is. Let's count the days from January 1 to May 31. Let's break it down month by month. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days in 2022 because it's not a leap year. March has 31 days, April has 30 days, and May has 31 days. But we need up to May 31. Wait, so the total days from January 1 to May 31 would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) = let's calculate that. \n\n31 + 28 is 59. 59 + 31 is 90. 90 + 30 is 120. 120 + 31 is 151. So May 31 is 151 days after January 1, 2022. \n\nNow, since January 1 is a Sunday, adding 151 days to that. But since weeks cycle every 7 days, I can divide 151 by 7 to find the number of weeks and the remainder will tell me how many days ahead. \n\n151 divided by 7 is 21 weeks with a remainder of 4 days. Because 21*7 is 147, and 151-147 is 4. So 4 days after Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 is Tuesday, +3 is Wednesday, +4 is Thursday. So May 31, 2022 would be a Thursday? Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the day count. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check a different known date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then May 1 is Sunday, so May 8 is Sunday, May 15, 22, 29. Then May 31 would be two days after May 29. So May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous answer. So which one is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again. Maybe my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 being a Sunday is wrong. Let me verify that. \n\nI think I might have confused the years. Let me check an actual calendar. Wait, I can't access external resources, but I can recall. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year), so 2021 started on a Thursday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day, so 2022 started on a Friday. Wait, that would mean January 1, 2022 is a Friday. So that changes things. \n\nSo if January 1, 2022 is a Friday, then my previous calculation was wrong. Let me recalculate. \n\nSo if January 1 is Friday, then adding 151 days. 151 divided by 7 is 21 weeks and 4 days. So 21 weeks later is still Friday, then adding 4 days: Friday + 1 is Saturday, +2 is Sunday, +3 is Monday, +4 is Tuesday. So May 31 would be Tuesday. But that contradicts the other method where May 1 is Sunday. \n\nWait, maybe my assumption that May 1 is Sunday is wrong. Let me check again. If January 1 is Friday, then let's count the days for May 1. \n\nJanuary has 31 days, so January 1 is Friday. Then February has 28 days, March 31, April 30. So from January 1 to May 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120 days. So May 1 is 120 days after January 1. 120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks (119 days) and 1 day. So 17 weeks later is Friday, plus 1 day is Saturday. So May 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then May 1 is Saturday. Then May 8 is Saturday, May 15 is Saturday, May 22 is Saturday, May 29 is Saturday. Then May 31 is two days after May 29, which would be Monday. Wait, that's conflicting again. \n\nWait, if May 1 is Saturday, then May 2 is Sunday, May 3 is Monday, May 4 is Tuesday, May 5 is Wednesday, May 6 is Thursday, May 7 is Friday, May 8 is Saturday. So May 29 is Saturday. Then May 30 is Sunday, May 31 is Monday. So that would make May 31 a Monday. But earlier calculation said Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a contradiction here. I must have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check again. \n\nFirst, let's confirm the day of the week for January 1, 2022. If I remember correctly, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but earlier I thought it was Friday. Let me think. If 2020 started on Wednesday, then 2021 started on Thursday (because 2020 had 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 days, so 2021 started two days later, which would be Friday? Wait, no. Wait, 366 days is 52 weeks and 2 days. So if 2020 started on Wednesday, then 2021 would start on Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on Friday + 1 day = Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. That's correct. \n\nSo January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, the number of days from January 1 to May 31 is 151 days. 151 divided by 7 is 21 weeks and 4 days. So 21 weeks later is Saturday, plus 4 days: Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday. Wait, that would make May 31 a Wednesday? But that contradicts the other calculation where May 1 is Saturday, leading to May 31 being Monday. \n\nWait, there's a mistake here. Let me recalculate the number of days from January 1 to May 31. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, and May 31. Wait, but if we're going up to May 31, then the total days would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+31=151. So that's correct. 151 days. \n\nBut if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 151 days. 151 divided by 7 is 21*7=147, remainder 4. So 147 days later is Saturday, then 4 days more: Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday. So May 31 would be Wednesday. But earlier, when I calculated May 1 as Saturday, then May 31 would be Monday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the May 1 calculation. Let's recalculate the days from January 1 to May 1. \n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March 31, April 30. So up to April 30 is 31+28+31+30 = 120 days. Then May 1 is day 121. So May 1 is 121 days after January 1. 121 divided by 7 is 17 weeks (119 days) and 2 days. So 17 weeks later is Saturday, plus 2 days: Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday. So May 1 is Monday? Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought May 1 was Saturday. \n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me start over. \n\nIf January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\n\nJanuary 8: Saturday\n\nJanuary 15: Saturday\n\nJanuary 22: Saturday\n\nJanuary 29: Saturday\n\nFebruary 5: Saturday\n\nFebruary 12: Saturday\n\nFebruary 19: Saturday\n\nFebruary 26: Saturday\n\nMarch 5: Saturday\n\nMarch 12: Saturday\n\nMarch 19: Saturday\n\nMarch 26: Saturday\n\nApril 2: Saturday\n\nApril 9: Saturday\n\nApril 16: Saturday\n\nApril 23: Saturday\n\nApril 30: Saturday\n\nSo April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. Wait, that's different from before. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. Then May 31 is two days after May 29, which would be Monday. So May 31 is Monday. \n\nBut according to the previous calculation, adding 151 days to January 1 (Saturday) gives 151 days later. 151 divided by 7 is 21*7=147, remainder 4. So 147 days later is Saturday, then 4 days later is Wednesday. But that contradicts the other method. \n\nSo where is the mistake here? \n\nAh! Wait, the number of days from January 1 to May 31 is 151 days. But if January 1 is day 0, then May 31 is day 150. Because if you count from day 1 as January 1, then May 31 is 151 days later. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the count. \n\nLet me clarify: If January 1 is day 1, then January 2 is day 2, etc. So the number of days between January 1 and May 31 inclusive is 151 days. But when calculating the day of the week, if you start on day 1 (Saturday), then day 1 is Saturday, day 2 is Sunday, etc. So to find the day of the week for day N, you can calculate (N-1) mod 7. \n\nSo for May 31, which is day 151, (151-1) = 150. 150 divided by 7 is 21*7=147, remainder 3. So 150 mod 7 is 3. So 3 days after Saturday. Saturday + 1 is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday. Wait, that would be Tuesday. But earlier calculation said Monday. \n\nThis is conflicting. There's clearly a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nIf May 1 is Sunday (as per the previous count where April 30 is Saturday), then May 1 is day 121. So day 121 is Sunday. Then May 31 is day 151. The difference between day 121 and day 151 is 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. So May 31 would be Tuesday. But earlier when I counted from April 30 (Saturday), May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, ..., May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday. \n\nBut earlier when I thought May 1 was Monday, that was a mistake. So the correct calculation is that May 1 is Sunday. Therefore, May 31 is Tuesday. \n\nBut why did the first calculation with 151 days from January 1 (Saturday) give a remainder of 3, which would be Tuesday? Because 151 days from January 1 (Saturday) would be 151 days later. But if January 1 is day 1, then day 151 is 150 days after January 1. 150 divided by 7 is 21*7=147, remainder 3. So 3 days after Saturday is Tuesday. So that's correct. \n\nSo the correct answer is Tuesday. But earlier when I thought May 1 was Saturday, that was wrong. The correct May 1 is Sunday. So the answer should be Tuesday. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, May 1, 2022. If I can confirm that, then I can count forward. \n\nI remember that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. Then May 31 is two days after May 29, which is Monday. Wait, that's conflicting again. \n\nWait, if May 29 is Sunday, then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday. So that's consistent with the previous calculation. So why did I think May 29 was Sunday? Because April 30 was Saturday, so May 1 is Sunday. Then May 29 is 28 days later. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so May 29 is also Sunday. Then May 31 is two days after that, which is Tuesday. \n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, May 31, 2022 is a Tuesday. \n\nBut earlier when I thought May 1 was Monday, that was a mistake. So the correct answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022 - what's the weekday?

Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can divide 81 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 81 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 4 days because 11 times 7 is 77, and 81 minus 77 is 4. So, going back 81 days is the same as going back 11 weeks and 4 days. Since 11 weeks is exactly 77 days, which brings me back to the same day of the week, the remaining 4 days will determine the weekday.\n\nNow, starting from Tuesday, October 4, 2022. If I go back 4 days, what day would that be? Let's count. One day before Tuesday is Monday, two days is Sunday, three days is Saturday, and four days is Friday. Wait, so going back 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday? But wait, that seems off. Wait, maybe I should check again. Let me think: if today is Tuesday, then yesterday was Monday (1 day back), the day before that was Sunday (2 days back), then Saturday (3 days back), and Friday (4 days back). Yes, that's correct. So going back 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this with another method to be sure. Maybe by checking the actual dates. Let me try to count backward step by step. Starting from October 4, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let's subtract days one by one. But that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or some known dates. Wait, I know that October has 31 days. So October 4 minus 4 days would be September 30, 2022. Wait, but that's only 4 days back. Wait, no, if I go back 4 days from October 4, that would be October 4 - 1 day = October 3 (Monday), then October 2 (Sunday), October 1 (Saturday), September 30 (Friday). So yes, that's four days back. So that's Friday. But wait, the total days to go back is 81 days. So if I go back 11 weeks (77 days) and then 4 days, that's 81 days. So the weekday would be Friday. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because if I go back 7 days, it's the same day. So 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. So the weekday would be Tuesday minus 4 days. Which is Friday. So that seems correct. But maybe I should check with another approach. Let me think about the actual date. Let's see, October 4, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let's count backward 81 days. Let me break it down into months. Let's see, October has 31 days. So going back from October 4, 2022, subtracting 81 days. Let's subtract 77 days first (11 weeks) which would bring me to October 4 minus 77 days. Let's calculate that. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 31 days is September 4, 2022. Then subtract another 31 days (October 4 minus 31 days is September 4, then minus another 31 days would be August 4, 2022. Wait, but 31 + 31 is 62 days. Then 77 days would be 62 + 15 days. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use a different method. Let me check the date 81 days before October 4, 2022. Let me use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to calculate manually. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. So if I go back 11 weeks from Tuesday, that's still Tuesday. Then go back 4 days: Tuesday minus 4 days is Friday. So the answer should be Friday. But I need to make sure that the 81 days is indeed 11 weeks and 4 days. 7*11 is 77, 81-77 is 4. Yes. So that's correct.

Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking: If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so I need to figure out the day of the week for March 25, given that January 1st is a Saturday.\n\nFirst, I should check how many days are there from January 1st to March 25th. Let me break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since the first day is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention a leap year. Hmm, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year unless specified. So February has 28 days. Then March 25th is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 25th would be 31 (January) - 1 (since we start counting from day 1 as Saturday) + 28 (February) + 25 (March). Wait, no, maybe I should calculate the total days between January 1st and March 25th inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if January 1st is day 0 (Saturday), then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So to find the number of days between January 1st and March 25th, I need to calculate the total days from January 1st to March 25th, then take that number modulo 7 to find the day of the week.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since day 0 is Jan 1st). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 25th is 25 days into March. Wait, but if I'm starting from January 1st, then the total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (Mar) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days from January 1st to March 25th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 25. Wait, that would be 30 days in January (since Jan 1 is day 0, Jan 2 is day 1, ..., Jan 31 is day 30). Then February has 28 days (days 31 to 58?), and March 25 is 25 days into March, so days 59 to 83? Wait, maybe I should just add up the days. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 25th. Let's do that step by step. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 25th is 25 days into March, so total days from January 1st to March 25th is 59 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but if January 1st is day 1, then March 25th would be day 84. But the problem says that January 1st is a Saturday. So if I count 84 days from January 1st, what day of the week is that?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if that's correct. Let me verify. January has 31 days, so January 1st is day 1 (Saturday). Then January 2nd is day 2 (Sunday), and so on. So January 31st is day 31. Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 31 + 28 = 59. Then March 1st is day 60. March 25th is 25 days after March 1st, so day 60 + 24 = day 84. Wait, because March 1st is day 60, so March 2nd is day 61, ..., March 25th is day 60 + 24 = day 84. So total days from January 1st to March 25th is 84 days. But since January 1st is a Saturday, then day 1 is Saturday. So day 84 is the day we need to find.\n\nNow, to find the day of the week, we can calculate 84 modulo 7. Because 7 days a week. 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 mod 7 is 0. So that would mean that day 84 is the same as day 0, which is Saturday. Wait, but day 1 is Saturday. So day 1 is Saturday, day 8 is Saturday again (since 7 days later). So day 84 is 12 weeks later, so same day as day 1, which is Saturday. But that would mean March 25th is a Saturday? But that seems odd. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. If January 1st is Saturday (day 1), then day 1: Saturday, day 2: Sunday, day 3: Monday, ..., day 7: Friday, day 8: Saturday again. So every 7 days, the same day of the week. So if day 1 is Saturday, then day 8 is Saturday, day 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, 78, 85... Wait, but 84 is 7*12=84. So day 84 is 12 weeks later, same as day 1. So day 84 is Saturday. But that would mean March 25th is a Saturday. But that seems like maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days between January 1st and March 25th. Let me count again. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 25th is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. But if January 1st is day 1, then March 25th is day 84. So 84 days later. But 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 12 weeks. So same day of the week. So Saturday. But that seems like maybe the answer is Saturday. But I need to check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the days from January 1st to March 25th as 84 days, but since the first day is day 1 (Saturday), then day 84 is 83 days later. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the count. Let me think again. If January 1st is day 0 (Saturday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Sunday), and so on. Then March 25th would be day 83. Because from January 1st (day 0) to March 25th is 83 days later. Then 83 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 6 days. So 83 mod 7 is 6. So day 0 is Saturday, adding 6 days would be Saturday + 6 days = Friday? Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. So which is correct?\n\nThis is the confusion here. The key is whether January 1st is considered day 0 or day 1. If the problem says that the first day of the year was a Saturday, then January 1st is Saturday. So if I count the number of days from January 1st to March 25th, inclusive, then the total days would be 84. But if I want to find how many days after January 1st, March 25th is, then it's 83 days later. Because January 1st is day 0, then March 25th is day 83. So 83 days later. Then 83 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. Wait, that would mean March 25th is a Friday. But earlier calculation said 84 days later, which is 12 weeks, same day. So which is correct?\n\nThis is the crux of the problem. Let me clarify. If January 1st is Saturday, then the next day, January 2nd, is Sunday. So the number of days between January 1st and March 25th is 84 days. But if you count the number of days from January 1st to March 25th inclusive, that's 84 days. But if you want to find how many days after January 1st, March 25th is, it's 83 days later. Because January 1st is day 0, then March 25th is day 83. So the difference is 83 days. So 83 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Saturday is Friday. Therefore, March 25th would be a Friday. But earlier when I thought of 84 days, that would be 12 weeks, same day. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check with a specific example. Let's take a known date. For example, if January 1st is Saturday, then January 8th is also Saturday. So the difference between January 1st and January 8th is 7 days. So if I count the number of days between January 1st and January 8th, inclusive, that's 8 days. But the number of days after January 1st is 7 days. So the correct way is to calculate the number of days after January 1st, which is (March 25th - January 1st) in days. So if I have 83 days after January 1st, then 83 mod 7 is 6. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. Therefore, March 25th is Friday. But why did I get conflicting results earlier?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula: (day of the year) mod 7. If January 1st is day 1 (Saturday), then the day of the week for any date is (day of the year - 1) mod 7. Wait, no. Let me think. If day 1 is Saturday, then day 1: Saturday, day 2: Sunday, ..., day 7: Friday, day 8: Saturday again. So the day of the week for day N is (N-1) mod 7. Because day 1 is Saturday, which is (1-1) mod 7 = 0, which is Saturday. Then day 2 is (2-1) mod 7 = 1, which is Sunday. So if March 25th is day 84, then (84-1) mod 7 = 83 mod 7. 83 divided by 7 is 11*7=77, 83-77=6. So 6 mod 7 is 6. So Saturday is 0, Sunday 1, Monday 2, Tuesday 3, Wednesday 4, Thursday 5, Friday 6. So 6 corresponds to Friday. Therefore, March 25th is Friday. So that's the answer.\n\nBut earlier when I thought of 84 days later, I thought that 84 mod 7 is 0, which would be Saturday. But that was because I was considering day 84 as the same as day 1. But if day 1 is Saturday, then day 84 is (84-1) mod 7 = 83 mod 7 = 6, which is Friday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be Friday.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step. January has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Let's count the days in January. January 1st is Saturday. Then January 8th is Saturday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Saturday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is Saturday. Then March 12th, 19th, 26th. Wait, March 26th is Saturday. So March 25th is one day before that, which is Friday. So that's correct. Therefore, March 25th is Friday. So the answer is Friday.", "Friday"], [74, "Determine the day of the month for the third Thursday in November 2022. Express your answer as a number. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the day of the month for the third Thursday in November 2022. Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Thursday would be the 3rd. Because November 1 is Tuesday, so the next day is Wednesday (2nd), then Thursday is the 3rd. So the first Thursday is the 3rd. Then the second Thursday would be the 10th, and the third would be the 17th. Wait, but wait, let me check again. If November 1 is Tuesday, then:\n\n- 1st: Tuesday\n- 2nd: Wednesday\n- 3rd: Thursday (first Thursday)\n- 10th: Thursday (second)\n- 17th: Thursday (third)\n- 24th: Thursday (fourth)\n- 31st: Thursday (fifth)\n\nSo the third Thursday would be the 17th.

Wait, that's a mistake. Wait, November has 30 days. So the 31st doesn't exist. So the fifth Thursday would be the 24th? Wait, let me recount. If the first Thursday is the 3rd, then adding 7 days each time. So 3 + 7 = 10 (second), 10 +7=17 (third), 17+7=24 (fourth), 24+7=31. But November only has 30 days. So the fifth Thursday would be the 31st, which doesn't exist. Therefore, the fourth Thursday would be the 24th, and the fifth would be the 31st, which is invalid. So the third Thursday is the 17th. Therefore, the answer should be 17. But wait, I need to make sure that my initial assumption about November 1, 2022, being a Tuesday is correct. Let me check that. Maybe I can use an online calendar or some other method. Alternatively, I can recall that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me think. If January 1, 2022, is Sunday, then January 2 is Monday, and so on. Then, let's count the days for November. But that might take too long. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year. Let me check the day of the week for November 1, 2022. Alternatively, I can use the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Wait, if December 1 is Thursday, then November 30 would be Wednesday. So November 30 is Wednesday. Then November 29 is Tuesday, 28 is Monday, 27 is Sunday, 26 is Saturday, 25 is Friday, 24 is Thursday. Wait, so the fourth Thursday would be the 24th. Then the third Thursday would be the 17th.

Then the next day, April 4, would be a Monday, and so on. Let me list out the Thursdays starting from April 3.\n\nWait, April 3 is Sunday. So the first Thursday after that would be April 7, right? Because April 3 is Sunday, then April 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu). So April 7 is the first Thursday. Then each week after that would be the next Thursday. Let me check how many weeks are between April 3 and June 28.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to list all the Thursdays in that period.

Wait, but let me check if all these dates are within the range. The start date is April 3 (Sunday) and end date is June 28 (Tuesday). So April 7 is after April 3, and June 23 is before June 28.

Wait, but let me check if June 23 is indeed before June 28. Yes, June 23 is the 23rd, and June 28 is the 28th. So that's included. So the total is 12 Thursdays. But wait, maybe I should check the actual dates to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but that might not be exact because of the start and end days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the number of weeks between the two dates. Let me calculate the total number of days from April 3 to June 28, inclusive.\n\nFirst, April has 30 days. So from April 3 to April 30 is 28 days (since April 3 is day 0, April 4 is day 1, etc. Wait, maybe it's easier to calculate the total days between the two dates.\n\nBut maybe I can use another approach. Let me check the dates again. Let me check the actual dates of the Thursdays.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to rely on my calculations.\n\nWait, April 3 is Sunday. So April 7 is Thursday. Then each week after that. Let me count the number of weeks between April 7 and June 28.\n\nFrom April 7 to June 28 is how many days?\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 7 to April 30 is 23 days (30 - 7 = 23, but since April 7 is included, it's 23 + 1 = 24 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have April 7 to April 8, that's 2 days. So from April 7 to April 30 is 30 - 7 = 23 days, but since April 7 is included, it's 23 + 1 = 24 days? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days between April 7 and April 30 inclusive is 30 - 7 + 1 = 24 days. Then May has 31 days, and June has 28 days. But June 28 is the end date. So from April 7 to June 28 is:\n\nApril 7 to April 30: 24 days\n\nMay: 31 days\n\nJune 1 to June 28: 28 days\n\nTotal days: 24 + 31 + 28 = 83 days.\n\nNow, if there are 83 days between April 7 and June 28 inclusive, then the number of Thursdays would be 83 divided by 7, rounded up or down depending on the start and end days. But since April 7 is a Thursday, the first day is a Thursday. So the number of Thursdays would be the ceiling of (83 / 7). Wait, but 83 divided by 7 is 11.857... So that would be 12 Thursdays. Which matches my previous count. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, since April 7 is the first Thursday, and adding 7 days each time, the last Thursday would be April 7 + 7*11 = April 7 + 77 days. Let's see: 77 days is 11 weeks. April 7 + 77 days is June 23 (since April 7 + 23 days is April 30, then May 7, 14, 21, 28, June 4, 11, 18, 25. Wait, that's 25 days from April 7 to June 25. Wait, maybe I need to check again. Alternatively, 7*11=77 days. April 7 + 77 days is June 23. Because April has 30 days, so 30-7=23 days left in April. Then May has 31 days, so 23 + 31 = 54 days from April 7 to May 31. Then 77-54=23 days into June, which is June 23. So yes, June 23 is the 12th Thursday. Then the next one would be June 30, which is beyond June 28. So that's 12 Thursdays.

First, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those days are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to find out what day of the week April 12, 2022, was, and then count the Mondays from there. Let me check. April 12, 2022, was a Tuesday. So if I start on Tuesday, then the next day is Wednesday, and so on. Let me confirm that. Let me think, maybe I can use a calendar or some method to find the days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but since the start and end dates might not align perfectly, I need to adjust for that. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days from April 12 to June 1, inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 12 to April 30, that's 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end dates, it's 18 + 1 = 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have April 12 (inclusive) to April 30 (inclusive), that's 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days, and June 1 is one day. So total days would be 19 (April) + 31 (May) + 1 (June) = 51 days total. Wait, but wait, the end date is June 1, so maybe that's correct. Let me check again.\n\nApril 12 to April 30: 30 - 12 = 18 days, but adding 1 for inclusivity gives 19 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 19 + 31 = 50 days. Then June 1 is one more day, so total is 51 days. So total days between April 12 and June 1 inclusive is 51 days.\n\nNow, if there are 51 days, then the number of weeks is 51 divided by 7. 7*7=49, so 51-49=2 days. So that would mean 7 weeks and 2 days. But since the start date is a Tuesday, the first day is Tuesday, so the next day is Wednesday, and so on. So the Mondays would be in the first week (if any), then each subsequent week, and then the remaining days.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the Mondays directly. Let's think. Since April 12 is a Tuesday, then April 13 is Wednesday, April 14 is Thursday, April 15 is Friday, April 16 is Saturday, April 17 is Sunday, April 18 is Monday. So the first Monday after April 12 is April 18. Then each week after that. Let's list the Mondays in April, May, and June.\n\nApril: April 18 is a Monday. Then April 25 is the next Monday. Then May 2 is the next, May 9, May 16, May 23, May 30. Then June 6, June 13, June 20, June 27. Wait, but the end date is June 1, so June 27 is beyond that. So let's check.\n\nWait, the period ends on June 1. So June 1 is the last day. So the Mondays in June would be June 6, 13, 20, 27. But June 27 is after June 1, so only June 6 is within the period? Wait, June 1 is the end date. So June 6 is after June 1? No, June 1 is the end date. Wait, June 1 is the last day. So June 6 is after June 1. Therefore, only the Mondays in April and May.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let's list all the Mondays between April 12 and June 1 inclusive.\n\nFirst, April 18 (Monday). Then April 25 (Monday). Then May 2 (Monday). May 9, May 16, May 23, May 30. Then June 6 is the next Monday, but June 6 is after June 1? Wait, June 1 is the end date. So June 6 is after June 1. Therefore, June 6 is not included. So the last Monday before June 1 would be May 30. Let me check May 30. May 30 is a Monday. Then May 31 is Tuesday, June 1 is Wednesday. So yes, May 30 is the last Monday in the period.\n\nSo how many Mondays are there? Let's count:\n\nApril: April 18, 25 (2 Mondays)\nMay: May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5 Mondays)\nTotal: 2 + 5 = 7 Mondays.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if April 18 is indeed within the period. The start date is April 12, so April 18 is included. Then April 25 is also included. Then May 2 is included. So that's correct. So 2 in April, 5 in May. Total 7. But wait, let me check if there's another Monday in June. June 1 is Wednesday, so June 1 is Wednesday. So June 6 is Monday, but that's after June 1. So no. Therefore, total of 7 Mondays.\n\nBut wait, let me check the total days again. If there are 51 days, and 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 2 days. So 7 weeks would have 7 Mondays. Then the remaining 2 days would be Tuesday and Wednesday. Since the first day is Tuesday, the next day is Wednesday. So the extra days are Tuesday and Wednesday. Therefore, there are 7 Mondays.

So yes, the first Wednesday is the 7th. Then the second Wednesday would be the 14th. So the answer would be 14. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If December 1 is Thursday, then the first Wednesday is the 7th, the second is the 14th, third is 21st, fourth is 28th. So the second Wednesday is the 14th. Therefore, the answer should be 14. But I need to make sure that December 1, 2022, was indeed a Thursday. Let me think again. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 1 would be 20 days earlier. Let's count the days. December has 31 days. If December 21 is a Wednesday, then December 20 is Tuesday, 19 is Monday, 18 is Sunday, 17 is Saturday, 16 is Friday, 15 is Thursday, 14 is Wednesday.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if December 28 is a Wednesday, then the first Wednesday is the 28th? That would mean that the first Wednesday is the 28th, which would make the second Wednesday the 4th of January 2023. But that's not possible because the question is about December. So clearly, I must have made a mistake here. Let me try again. Let's take a different approach. Let's use the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. If that's correct, then the first Wednesday is the 7th, the second is the 14th. But if December 28 is a Wednesday, then that would mean that December 1 is a Thursday. Because December 1 is Thursday, then December 28 is 27 days later. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Thursday would be Wednesday. So that's correct. So December 28 is a Wednesday. Therefore, the first Wednesday is the 7th, second is 14th, third is 21st, fourth is 28th. So the second Wednesday is the 14th. Therefore, the answer should be 14. But wait, if December 28 is a Wednesday, then the fourth Wednesday is the 28th. So the second is 14th. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 14.", "14"], [74, "Between Saturday, March 19, 2022 and Sunday, May 8, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? State the amount as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between March 19, 2022 (Saturday) and May 8, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday. So weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total days. March 19 is a Saturday. Let me check the dates. March has 31 days, so March 19 to March 31 is 13 days (including March 19). Then April has 30 days, and May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total days would be 13 (March) + 30 (April) + 8 (May) = 51 days. Wait, but wait, March 19 to March 31 is 13 days? Let me check again. March 19 is day 1. March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13. Yes, that's correct. Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days. Then May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total days from March 19 to May 8 inclusive is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. Wait, but maybe I should check using another method. Alternatively, maybe using a date calculator would help, but since I can't do that, I need to calculate manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of weeks and days. Let's see. March 19 is a Saturday. Let's count the days from March 19 to May 8. Let's break it down:\n\nMarch 19 (Saturday) to March 25 (Friday) is 7 days (including March 19). Then March 26 (Saturday) to March 31 (Thursday) is 6 days. Then April has 30 days, so April 1 is a Friday. Wait, wait, maybe I need to check the days of the week for each month. Wait, March 19 is a Saturday. Let me check what day March 25 is. March 19 is Saturday, so March 20 is Sunday, March 21 is Monday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 23 is Wednesday, March 24 is Thursday, March 25 is Friday. So March 25 is Friday. Then March 26 is Saturday, March 27 is Sunday, March 28 is Monday, March 29 is Tuesday, March 30 is Wednesday, March 31 is Thursday. So March 31 is Thursday. Then April 1 is Friday. April has 30 days. So April 1 is Friday, April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday, and so on. Then May 1 is Monday. May 8 is Sunday.\n\nSo from March 19 to May 8 inclusive, let's count the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays). Let's start with March 19 (Saturday) and March 20 (Sunday). Then March 26 (Saturday), March 27 (Sunday). Then April 2 (Saturday), April 3 (Sunday), April 9 (Saturday), April 10 (Sunday), April 16 (Saturday), April 17 (Sunday), April 23 (Saturday), April 24 (Sunday), April 30 (Saturday). Then May 1 is Monday, May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 is Wednesday, May 4 is Thursday, May 5 is Friday, May 6 is Saturday, May 7 is Sunday, May 8 is Monday? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Monday. So May 1 is Monday, May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 is Wednesday, May 4 is Thursday, May 5 is Friday, May 6 is Saturday, May 7 is Sunday, May 8 is Monday. Wait, but the end date is May 8, which is a Sunday? Wait, the original question says that May 8 is Sunday. Wait, but according to my calculation, May 8 would be Monday. That's a contradiction. So maybe I made a mistake in the days of the week.\n\nWait, let me check again. March 19, 2022 is a Saturday. Let me check what day May 8, 2022 is. Wait, I can use an online calendar, but since I can't, I need to calculate. Let's see. March 19 is Saturday. March 25 is Friday. March 26 is Saturday. March 31 is Thursday. April 1 is Friday. April 2 is Saturday. April 3 is Sunday. April 4 is Monday. April 5 is Tuesday. April 6 is Wednesday. April 7 is Thursday. April 8 is Friday. April 9 is Saturday. April 10 is Sunday. April 11 is Monday. April 12 is Tuesday. April 13 is Wednesday. April 14 is Thursday. April 15 is Friday. April 16 is Saturday. April 17 is Sunday. April 18 is Monday. April 19 is Tuesday. April 20 is Wednesday. April 21 is Thursday. April 22 is Friday. April 23 is Saturday. April 24 is Sunday. April 25 is Monday. April 26 is Tuesday. April 27 is Wednesday. April 28 is Thursday. April 29 is Friday. April 30 is Saturday. May 1 is Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if April 30 is Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. But the original question says that May 8 is Sunday. Let me check May 8. May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday, May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. Yes, that's correct. So May 8 is Sunday. So my previous calculation was wrong. So April 30 is Saturday, May 1 is Sunday. So that's correct.\n\nSo now, let's count the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) between March 19 and May 8 inclusive.\n\nFirst, March 19 is Saturday. Then March 20 is Sunday. Then March 26 is Saturday, March 27 is Sunday. Then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. April 9 is Saturday, April 10 is Sunday. April 16 is Saturday, April 17 is Sunday. April 23 is Saturday, April 24 is Sunday. April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday, May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday.\n\nWait, let's list all the Saturdays and Sundays in this period.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nMarch 19, March 26, April 2, April 9, April 16, April 23, April 30, May 7.\n\nSundays:\n\nMarch 20, March 27, April 3, April 10, April 17, April 24, May 1, May 8.\n\nSo that's 8 Saturdays and 8 Sundays. Wait, let me count again.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nMarch 19 (1), March 26 (2), April 2 (3), April 9 (4), April 16 (5), April 23 (6), April 30 (7), May 7 (8). So 8 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\nMarch 20 (1), March 27 (2), April 3 (3), April 10 (4), April 17 (5), April 24 (6), May 1 (7), May 8 (8). So 8 Sundays.\n\nTotal weekends: 8 + 8 = 16 days.\n\nTotal days from March 19 to May 8 inclusive is 51 days (as calculated earlier). So business days would be 51 - 16 = 35 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because if there are 51 days total, and 16 weekends, then 51 - 16 = 35. But maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again.\n\nMarch 19 to March 31: March 19 is day 1, March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13. So 13 days in March.\n\nApril has 30 days, so adding 30 days. Then May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. That's correct.\n\nSo 51 total days. 16 weekends. So 51 - 16 = 35 business days. But wait, let me check if the count of weekends is correct. Let me list all the weekends again.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nMarch 19, 26 (2), April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (7), May 7 (8). That's 8 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\nMarch 20, 27 (2), April 3, 10, 17, 24 (6), May 1, 8 (8). That's 8 Sundays. So 16 total weekends. So 51 - 16 = 35. So the answer should be 35.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the number of Mondays to Fridays in each month.\n\nMarch: March 19 is Saturday. So March 20 is Sunday, March 21 is Monday. So March 21 to March 25 is 5 days (Monday to Friday). Then March 26 is Saturday, March 27 Sunday, March 28 Monday, March 29 Tuesday, March 30 Wednesday, March 31 Thursday. So March 21-25 is 5 days, March 28-31 is 4 days. Wait, March 28 is Monday, March 29 Tuesday, March 30 Wednesday, March 31 Thursday. So that's 4 days. So March has 5 + 4 = 9 business days.\n\nApril: April 1 is Friday. So April 1 is Friday, April 2 Saturday, April 3 Sunday, April 4 Monday, April 5 Tuesday, April 6 Wednesday, April 7 Thursday, April 8 Friday, April 9 Saturday, etc. So in April, the business days are from April 1 (Friday) to April 30 (Saturday). Let's count the number of business days in April. Since April has 30 days, and the first day is Friday. So the business days would be:\n\nApril 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu), 8 (Fri), 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun), 11 (Mon), 12 (Tue), 13 (Wed), 14 (Thu), 15 (Fri), 16 (Sat), 17 (Sun), 18 (Mon), 19 (Tue), 20 (Wed), 21 (Thu), 22 (Fri), 23 (Sat), 24 (Sun), 25 (Mon), 26 (Tue), 27 (Wed), 28 (Thu), 29 (Fri), 30 (Sat).\n\nSo in April, the business days are all days except Saturdays and Sundays. So from April 1 to April 30, how many business days?\n\nEach week has 5 business days. April has 30 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, plus 2 days (April 29 and 30). But April 29 is Friday, April 30 is Saturday. So in the 4 weeks, there are 4*5=20 business days. Then the remaining two days are April 29 (Friday) and April 30 (Saturday). So business days in April would be 20 + 1 (April 29) = 21 days. Wait, because April 29 is a business day (Friday), and April 30 is a Saturday (non-business). So total business days in April is 21.\n\nThen May: May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday, May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. So the business days in May are from May 2 (Monday) to May 5 (Thursday), May 6 (Friday). Then May 7 is Saturday (non-business), May 8 is Sunday (non-business). So in May, the business days are May 2-6 (5 days) and May 7 is Saturday, so only 5 days. Wait, but May 1 is Sunday, so May 2 is Monday. So May 2 to May 6 is 5 days (Monday to Friday). Then May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. So May has 5 business days.\n\nSo total business days would be March (9) + April (21) + May (5) = 35. That matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 35.", "35"], [74, "Determine if the year 2043 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2043 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2043 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2043 divided by 4. 4 times 510 is 2040, so 2043 minus 2040 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 2043 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check the rules to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nThe rules are: 1) divisible by 4, 2) if divisible by 100, must also be divisible by 400. So, since 2043 isn't divisible by 4, it automatically fails the first condition. Therefore, regardless of whether it's a century year or not, it can't be a leap year. Let me confirm that 2043 isn't a century year. Century years are every 100 years, like 2000, 2100, etc. 2043 is between 2000 and 2100, but not a multiple of 100. So the second condition doesn't apply here. \n\nSo, since 2043 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. Therefore, the answer should be No.", "No"], [74, "Count the occurrences of Monday from Friday, August 5 to Monday, August 29, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Express your answer as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Mondays there are from August 5, 2022, to August 29, 2022, inclusive. Both dates are included, so I need to check if both are Mondays and count them if they are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week August 5, 2022, was. Let me recall that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing up the days. Let me check. Wait, maybe I should use a calendar or some method to confirm. Alternatively, I can use the fact that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, but I need to be sure. Let me think. Let's take a known date. For example, August 1, 2022, was a Monday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think I need to check this again. Let me think. Let me recall that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then, I can count the days step by step. But maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the fact that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that August 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Let me try to find a way to calculate the day of the week for August 5, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. If August 5 is a Friday, then August 6 is Saturday, 7 is Sunday, 8 is Monday, 9 is Tuesday, 10 is Wednesday, 11 is Thursday, 12 is Friday, and so on. So the first Monday in August 2022 would be August 8. Then the next Mondays would be August 15, 22, and 29. Wait, but the end date is August 29, which is a Monday. So from August 5 (Friday) to August 29 (Monday), inclusive. So the Mondays would be August 8, 15, 22, and 29. That's four Mondays. Wait, but let me check again. Let me count the days between August 5 and August 29.\n\nWait, August 5 is Friday. Then August 8 is Monday. Then adding 7 days: August 15 is Monday, then 22, then 29. So that's four Mondays. But wait, August 29 is included, so that's correct. So the answer should be 4. But wait, let me make sure that August 5 is indeed a Friday. Because if that's wrong, the entire calculation is off. Let me check. Let's take a known date. For example, August 1, 2022. If I can find that, then I can count. Let me think. I remember that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then July 1 is Friday, July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. Then August 5 is the next Friday. So August 5, 2022, is a Friday. Therefore, August 8 is Monday.

From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 1950. First, divide 1950 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 487 is 1948, so 1950 minus 1948 is 2. That means 1950 divided by 4 is 487.5, which isn't a whole number. So 1950 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the rules, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check.

I remember that sometimes you can use known dates to calculate this. For example, if I know that a certain date is a specific day, I can count forward or backward to find others.\n\nFirst, I should check if I remember any key dates in 2022. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then I can count the days from there. But wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use another method. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that might not be right. Maybe I should think of a more reliable way. Let me try to recall. \n\nAnother approach is to use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's break down the months between January 1, 2022 and May 16, 2022. \n\nStarting from January 1, 2022 (Sunday), let's count the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Sunday. Then February has 28 days (since 2022 is not a leap year). March has 31 days, April has 30 days, and May 16 is the target date.\n\nSo from January 1 to May 16, how many days is that?\n\nJanuary: 31 days. But since we start on January 1, the days from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March 31, April 30, and then 16 days in May.\n\nWait, but if I want to find the day of the week for May 16, I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1 to May 16, then find the remainder when divided by 7. Because each week has 7 days.\n\nSo total days from January 1 to May 16:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (including January 1)\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 16 days\n\nWait, but if I add all those up, that's 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 16. Let me calculate that:\n\n31 + 28 is 59. 59 + 31 is 90. 90 + 30 is 120. 120 + 16 is 136 days. But wait, that's the total number of days from January 1 to May 16 inclusive? Or is that the total days from January 1 to May 16, but if January 1 is day 1, then May 16 would be day 136. But if January 1 is a Sunday, then day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, etc. So to find the day of the week for May 16, I need to find 136 days from January 1. But since January 1 is day 1 (Sunday), then day 136 would be 135 days later. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the number of days between January 1 and May 16. If January 1 is day 0, then May 16 would be 135 days later. But I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total days from January 1 to May 16, and then take modulo 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down month by month. Let's see:\n\nFrom January 1 (Sunday) to January 31 is 30 days later (since January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, etc. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better way is to count the number of days from January 1 to May 16, and then find the remainder when divided by 7.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March 31, April 30, and May 16. So total days from January 1 to May 16 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 16 (May) = 136 days. But if January 1 is day 1, then May 16 is day 136. But since each week has 7 days, the day of the week would be (136 - 1) mod 7 + 1? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1 is a Sunday, then January 1 is day 0 (Sunday), January 2 is day 1 (Monday), ..., January 7 is day 6 (Saturday), then January 8 is day 0 (Sunday) again. So the day of the week for any date can be calculated by taking the number of days since January 1, modulo 7. If the remainder is 0, it's Sunday; 1 is Monday, etc.\n\nSo if May 16 is 135 days after January 1 (since January 1 is day 0), then 135 divided by 7 is 19 weeks and 2 days. So 135 mod 7 is 2. So that would mean that May 16 is 2 days after Sunday, which is Monday. Wait, but that would mean May 16 is a Monday? But I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1 is Sunday (day 0), then day 1 is Monday, day 2 is Tuesday, day 3 is Wednesday, day 4 is Thursday, day 5 is Friday, day 6 is Saturday, day 7 is Sunday again. So the remainder when divided by 7 gives the number of days after Sunday. So if the remainder is 0, it's Sunday. So for May 16, which is 135 days after January 1, 135 divided by 7 is 19*7=133, remainder 2. So 135 mod 7 is 2. So that would mean that May 16 is 2 days after Sunday, which is Monday. But I need to confirm if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check a known date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's true, then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday, May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday. So May 16 would be 15 days after May 1. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So May 16 would be 1 day after Sunday, which is Monday. So that would confirm that May 16 is a Monday. But wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 16 is 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks (14 days) and 1 day. So yes, May 16 would be a Monday. So that seems to check out.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that May 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday. How can I confirm that? Maybe I can check another date. For example, April 1, 2022. If April 1 is a Friday, then May 1 would be 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 1 (Friday) + 2 days is Sunday. So May 1 would be Sunday. That seems correct. So if April 1 is Friday, then May 1 is Sunday. Let me check if April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Alternatively, I can use another method. For example, I know that March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If March 14 is Monday, then March 15 is Tuesday, March 16 is Wednesday, March 17 is Thursday, March 18 is Friday, March 19 is Saturday, March 20 is Sunday. Then March 21 is Monday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. Wait, March has 31 days. So March 1 is 31 days before March 31. Wait, March 1 is 31 days before March 31. Wait, if March 14 is Monday, then March 1 is 13 days before March 14. 13 days is 1 week and 6 days. So March 1 would be 6 days before Monday, which is Friday. So March 1 is Friday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be Friday + 3 days = Monday. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier thought that April 1 is Friday. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, if March 14 is Monday, then March 1 is 13 days earlier. Let's count backwards. March 14 is Monday. March 14 - 7 days is March 7 (Monday). March 7 - 7 days is March 1 (Monday). Wait, that would mean March 1 is Monday. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if March 14 is Monday, then March 1 is 13 days before. Let's count backwards:\n\nMarch 14 (Monday)\nMarch 7 (Monday)\nMarch 1 (Monday). So that would mean March 1 is Monday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be Monday + 3 days = Thursday. But that contradicts the previous thought that April 1 is Friday. So there's inconsistency here. Maybe my initial assumption that March 14 is Monday is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I need to check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use an online calendar or a known date. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think I remember that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. If that's correct, then May 16 is 15 days later, which is Monday. But how to confirm May 1 is Sunday?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let's check that. If January 1, 2022 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday, January 15 is Sunday, January 22 is Sunday, January 29 is Sunday. Then February 5 is Sunday. February 12 is Sunday, February 19 is Sunday, February 26 is Sunday. March 5 is Sunday, March 12 is Sunday, March 19 is Sunday, March 26 is Sunday. April 2 is Sunday, April 9 is Sunday, April 16 is Sunday, April 23 is Sunday, April 30 is Sunday. Then May 7 is Sunday. So May 7 is Sunday. Then May 16 is 9 days later. 9 days is 1 week and 2 days. So May 16 would be Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, if January 1 is Sunday, then May 7 is Sunday. Then May 16 is 9 days after May 7. 9 days is 1 week (7 days) and 2 days. So May 16 would be Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. But earlier I thought May 16 was Monday. So which is correct?\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday might be wrong. Let me check again. How can I verify that?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 31, 2021 was a Saturday. Because I remember that 2021 started on a Monday. Wait, no, 2021 started on a Monday? Wait, January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Wait, I think I need to recall correctly. Let me think. 2020 was a leap year, so January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2021 started on a Thursday. Wait, no, because 2020 had 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be 2 days after Wednesday, which is Friday. So January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be 1 day after Friday, which is Saturday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought that it was a Sunday. So now I'm really confused. \n\nIf January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday, February 12 is Saturday, February 19 is Saturday, February 26 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday, March 12 is Saturday, March 19 is Saturday, March 26 is Saturday. April 2 is Saturday, April 9 is Saturday, April 16 is Saturday, April 23 is Saturday, April 30 is Saturday. Then May 7 is Saturday. So May 7 is Saturday. Then May 16 is 9 days later, which is 1 week and 2 days. So May 16 would be Monday. Wait, that's different from the previous calculation. So if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then May 16 is Monday. But earlier when I thought January 1 was Sunday, I got Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to find a different approach. Let me try to use the fact that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. If that's true, then May 16 is 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So May 16 would be Monday. But how to confirm that May 1 is Sunday?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. If April 1 is Friday, then May 1 is 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 would be Friday + 2 days = Sunday. That would make May 1 a Sunday, and May 16 a Monday. So that seems consistent. But how do I know April 1, 2022 was a Friday?\n\nIf I can confirm that, then I can be sure. Let's try to check. If March 14, 2022 was a Monday, then March 1 is 13 days earlier. March 14 is Monday. March 7 is Monday. March 1 is Monday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be Monday + 3 days = Thursday. But that contradicts the previous thought that April 1 is Friday. So now I'm really confused again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe March 14, 2022 was not a Monday. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me think. If I know that May 1 is Sunday, then May 7 is Sunday, May 14 is Sunday, and May 16 is Monday. So that would be correct. But how to confirm May 1 is Sunday?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. If that's true, then May 1 is 30 days later, which is 2 days after Friday, so Sunday. Then May 16 is 15 days after May 1, which is 1 day after Sunday, so Monday. So that would make May 16 a Monday. \n\nBut how to confirm April 1, 2022 was a Friday? Let's try to check. If March 1, 2022 was a Monday, then March 1 is Monday. March has 31 days, so March 1 + 30 days is April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 1 would be Monday + 2 days = Wednesday. But that contradicts the previous thought that April 1 is Friday. So this is conflicting again.\n\nI think I need to find a more reliable method. Maybe I can use the fact that I know the day of the week for a specific date in 2022. For example, I remember that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. If that's correct, then May 16 is Monday. Alternatively, I can check another date. For example, June 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 31 is Sunday, June 1 is Monday. Wait, that contradicts. So that can't be right. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 16 is Monday. Then May 31 is Sunday. Then June 1 is Monday. But if June 1 is Tuesday, that would mean that May 31 is Monday, which contradicts. So this suggests that May 1 is not Sunday. \n\nAlternatively, if June 1, 2"], [74, "On which weekday did April 5, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week April 5, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2022 would be a year later, so adding 365 days. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on a Saturday, then 2022 would start on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. \n\nNow, I need to find April 5. Let's count the days from January 1 to April 5. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days in 2022 because it's not a leap year. March has 31 days. So adding those up: 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) = 90 days. Then April 5 is 5 days into April. So total days from January 1 to April 5 is 90 + 5 = 95 days. \n\nNow, since January 1 is a Sunday, adding 95 days. Let's divide 95 by 7 to find the number of weeks and remaining days. 7*13 is 91, so 95-91 is 4 days. So 95 days later is 13 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Sunday. Sunday + 1 is Monday, +2 Tuesday, +3 Wednesday, +4 Thursday. So April 5, 2022 would be a Thursday? Wait, but I'm not sure if my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 being a Sunday is correct. Maybe I should verify that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check a known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then April 5 would be 4 days later. So Friday + 4 days is Tuesday? Wait, that contradicts my previous answer. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then April 5 would be Friday + 4 days = Tuesday. But that would mean my first calculation was wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check the days again. If January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then let's count the days step by step. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Sunday. Wait, but February has 28 days, so February 28 is a Sunday? Wait, no. Let me think. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 31 is a Tuesday (since 31 days later is 31 mod 7 = 3 days later. Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday? Wait, maybe I need to calculate each month's days properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use an online calendar or a known reference. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try again. \n\nIf January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday\n\nJanuary 15: Sunday\n\nJanuary 22: Sunday\n\nJanuary 29: Sunday\n\nFebruary 5: Sunday\n\nFebruary 12: Sunday\n\nFebruary 19: Sunday\n\nFebruary 26: Sunday\n\nMarch 5: Sunday\n\nMarch 12: Sunday\n\nMarch 19: Sunday\n\nMarch 26: Sunday\n\nApril 2: Sunday\n\nApril 9: Sunday\n\nSo April 2 is a Sunday. Then April 5 would be Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous thought. Wait, if April 2 is Sunday, then April 3 is Monday, April 4 is Tuesday, April 5 is Wednesday. So that would mean April 5 is a Wednesday. But earlier I thought April 1 was Friday. Wait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is Sunday is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1 is Friday, then April 5 is Tuesday. But according to the previous calculation, if April 2 is Sunday, then April 1 would be Saturday. That's conflicting. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is Sunday must be wrong. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check the correct day for January 1, 2022. Let me think. I remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year), so 2021 would start on Wednesday + 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So 2021 would start on Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2022 would start on Friday + 1 day (since 2021 is not a leap year) = Saturday. Wait, so January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday? That would change things. \n\nSo if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then let's recalculate. \n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\n\nJanuary 8: Saturday\n\nJanuary 15: Saturday\n\nJanuary 22: Saturday\n\nJanuary 29: Saturday\n\nFebruary 5: Saturday\n\nFebruary 12: Saturday\n\nFebruary 19: Saturday\n\nFebruary 26: Saturday\n\nMarch 5: Saturday\n\nMarch 12: Saturday\n\nMarch 19: Saturday\n\nMarch 26: Saturday\n\nApril 2: Saturday\n\nApril 9: Saturday\n\nSo April 2 is Saturday. Then April 5 would be Tuesday. That matches the earlier thought that April 1 is Friday. Wait, if April 2 is Saturday, then April 1 is Friday. So that's correct. So April 5 would be Tuesday. \n\nBut earlier when I thought January 1 was Sunday, I got conflicting results. So the correct day for January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, April 5, 2022 is Tuesday. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, April 1, 2022 was a Friday. If that's correct, then April 5 is Tuesday. So that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, I can check the day of the week for a specific date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday.

Hmm, first, maybe I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the days would go like this:\n\nNovember 1: Tuesday\nNovember 2: Wednesday\nNovember 3: Thursday\nNovember 4: Friday\nNovember 5: Saturday\nNovember 6: Sunday\nNovember 7: Monday\nNovember 8: Tuesday\nNovember 9: Wednesday\nNovember 10: Thursday\nNovember 11: Friday\nNovember 12: Saturday\nNovember 13: Sunday\nNovember 14: Monday\nNovember 15: Tuesday\nNovember 16: Wednesday\nNovember 17: Thursday\nNovember 18: Friday\nNovember 19: Saturday\nNovember 20: Sunday\nNovember 21: Monday\nNovember 22: Tuesday\nNovember 23: Wednesday\nNovember 24: Thursday\nNovember 25: Friday\nNovember 26: Saturday\nNovember 27: Sunday\nNovember 28: Monday\nNovember 29: Tuesday\nNovember 30: Wednesday\n\nWait, so the Wednesdays would be on the 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, and 30th. So the fourth Wednesday would be the 23rd? Wait, let me count again. First Wednesday is 2nd, second is 9th, third is 16th, fourth is 23rd. Then the fifth is 30th. So the fourth one is the 23rd. But wait, November has 30 days. So 23rd is a Wednesday. So the answer should be 23. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again. Maybe I should verify the actual calendar for November 2022.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method. Let's check online or recall that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. So adding days:\n\nWeek 1: 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon)\nWeek 2: 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon)\nWeek 3: 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon)\nWeek 4: 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon)\nWeek 5: 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed)\n\nSo the Wednesdays are 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Therefore, the fourth Wednesday is the 23rd. So the answer should be 23. But wait, the question says to reply with the numerical value. So the answer is 23.

Let's think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If July 1 is Friday, then June 30 is Thursday. Let's count backwards. June has 30 days. So May has 31 days. So May 31 is 31 days before June 30. Wait, that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 13 is 12 days after May 1. If I can find May 1's day, then adding 12 days would give me May 13. But how do I find May 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If that's correct, then I can count the days from January 1 to May 13. Let's see. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Sunday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so February 1 is a Monday (since 31 days in January, 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days, so January 1 is Sunday, then February 1 is Sunday + 3 days = Wednesday? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday, January 15 is Sunday, January 22 is Sunday, January 29 is Sunday. Then February 5 is Sunday. So February 1 would be 4 days before Sunday, which is Thursday. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 2 is Monday, and so on. So January 1 is Sunday, January 2 is Monday, ..., January 7 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Sunday again. So January 31 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 31 is 3 days after Sunday, which is Wednesday. So February 1 is Thursday. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days later. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28 is also Thursday. Then March 1 is Friday. March has 31 days, so March 1 is Friday. March 31 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 31 is Friday + 3 days = Monday. Then April 1 is Tuesday.

Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that. I think I might have made a mistake in that calculation. Let me verify January 1, 2022. I can check online, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday.

If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday, and so on. Then January 31 is 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So January 31 is Saturday + 2 days = Monday. Then February 1 is Tuesday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is Tuesday. March 1 is Wednesday. March has 31 days, so March 31 is Wednesday + 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days, so March 31 is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. April 1 is Saturday. April has 30 days, so April 30 is Saturday + 29 days. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day, so April 30 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. Then May 13 is 12 days later. So May 1 is Monday, May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 is Wednesday, May 4 is Thursday, May 5 is Friday, May 6 is Saturday, May 7 is Sunday, May 8 is Monday, May 9 is Tuesday, May 10 is Wednesday, May 11 is Thursday, May 12 is Friday, May 13 is Saturday. Wait, that would make May 13 a Saturday. But this contradicts previous calculations. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to find a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2023, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is a known date. Wait, I think I remember that May 13, 2022 was a Friday. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the day of the week for a specific event. For example, if I know that May 13, 2022 was a Friday, then that's the answer. But I need to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2021 plus 365 days. Since 2022 is not a leap year, 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if May 13, 2021 was a Thursday, then May 13, 2022 would be a Friday. But I don't know what day May 13, 2021 was. Alternatively, maybe I can use another reference date. For example, I know that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4, 2021 is Monday, then July 5 is Tuesday, and so on. Let's count backwards. July 4 is Monday. June 30 is the day before, which is Sunday. Then May 31 is 31 days before June 30. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So May 31 is Sunday minus 3 days, which is Thursday. Then May 13 is 18 days before May 31. 18 days is 2 weeks and 4 days. So May 13 would be Thursday minus 4 days, which is Sunday. Wait, that would make May 13, 2021 a Sunday. Then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make May 13, 2022 a Monday. But that contradicts the previous thought that it was a Friday. I'm getting confused again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2023, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2020 plus 2 years. 2020 is a leap year, so 2 years later would be 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 days. So if May 13, 2020 was a certain day, then May 13, 2022 would be two days later. But I don't know what day May 13, 2020 was. Alternatively, maybe I can use another reference date. For example, I know that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2021 plus 365 days. If I can find May 13, 2021, then I can add 1 day to get May 13, 2022. But I don't know May 13, 2021. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just accept that I'm not sure and try to find a better way. Alternatively, I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2022. Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2022. I think I need to find a different approach. \n\nWait, I think I remember that May 13, 2022 was a Friday. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2022. I think I need to stop and just answer based on the previous calculation where I thought May 1 was a Friday, leading to May 13 being a Wednesday. But that contradicts other calculations. I think I need to check again. \n\nLet me try again. If January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. So February 1 is 4 days before Saturday, which is Tuesday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is Tuesday. March 1 is Wednesday. March has 31 days, so March 31 is Wednesday + 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days, so March 31 is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. April 1 is Saturday. April has 30 days, so April 30 is Saturday + 29 days. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day, so April 30 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. Then May 1 is Monday. So May 1 is Monday. Then May 13 is 12 days later. Let's count: May 1 (Monday), May 2 (Tuesday), May 3 (Wednesday), May 4 (Thursday), May 5 (Friday), May 6 (Saturday), May 7 (Sunday), May 8 (Monday), May 9 (Tuesday), May 10 (Wednesday), May 11 (Thursday), May 12 (Friday), May 13 (Saturday). So according to this, May 13, 2022 is a Saturday. But I'm not sure if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nIf January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, ..., January 7 is Friday. January 8 is Saturday. January 15 is Saturday. January 22 is Saturday. January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. So February 1 is 4 days before Saturday, which is Tuesday. February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 28 is 28 days later, which is Tuesday. March 1 is Wednesday. March 31 is 31 days later. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 31 is Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday. April 1 is Sunday. April 30 is 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 30 is Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. Then May 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. So if March 31 is Saturday, then April 1 is Sunday. April 30 is Tuesday. Then May 1 is Wednesday. So May 1 is Wednesday. Then May 13 is 12 days later. Let's count: May 1 (Wednesday), May 2 (Thursday), May 3 (Friday), May 4 (Saturday), May 5 (Sunday), May 6 (Monday), May 7 (Tuesday), May 8 (Wednesday), May 9 (Thursday), May 10 (Friday), May 11 (Saturday), May 12 (Sunday), May 13 (Monday). So according to this, May 13, 2022 is a Monday. \n\nBut this is conflicting with the previous calculation where I thought May 1 was Monday. So I'm confused. I think I need to find a way to verify this. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2022. Wait, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the same as May 13, 2022. I think I need to accept that I'm not sure and maybe look up the correct answer.

If it doesn't exist, I should answer -1. Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week January 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Oh right, because I think 2022 started on a Saturday. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then the first Tuesday would be the 3rd. Let me count: January 1 is Saturday, 2nd is Sunday, 3rd is Monday? Wait, no. Wait, Saturday is day 1, Sunday is 2, Monday is 3, Tuesday is 4. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if January 1 is a Saturday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\nJanuary 2: Sunday\nJanuary 3: Monday\nJanuary 4: Tuesday. So the first Tuesday is the 4th. Then the second Tuesday would be the 11th, third is 18th, and fourth is 25th. Wait, but wait, let me check again. Let me list them out step by step.\n\nFirst, January 1, 2022: Saturday. So:\n\nWeek 1:\n- 1 (Sat)\n- 2 (Sun)\n- 3 (Mon)\n- 4 (Tue) \u2192 first Tuesday.\n\nThen the next Tuesday would be 4 + 7 = 11th. Second Tuesday is 11th. Then third is 18th, fourth is 25th. So the fourth Tuesday would be the 25th. But wait, does January 2022 have 31 days, so 25th is valid. So the answer should be 25. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me check another way. Maybe I can look up the actual calendar for January 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but I can verify. Let me think again. If January 1 is Saturday, then:\n\nWeek 1: 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri)\nWeek 2: 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue)\nWeek 3: 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri), 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun), 17 (Mon), 18 (Tue)\nWeek 4: 19 (Wed), 20 (Thu), 21 (Fri), 22 (Sat), 23 (Sun), 24 (Mon), 25 (Tue)\nWeek 5: 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri), 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon)\n\nSo the Tuesdays are on 4, 11, 18, 25. So the fourth is 25. Therefore, the answer should be 25. But wait, maybe I got the starting day wrong. Let me check another way. For example, if I know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday, then the first Tuesday is the 4th. Then adding 7 days each time. So 4, 11, 18, 25. Yes, that's four Tuesdays. So the fourth is 25.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that October 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then I can count the Fridays from there.\n\nSo, if October 1 is a Saturday, then the first Friday of the month would be October 7th. Because the first week starts on the 1st, so the first Friday is the 7th. Then the second Friday would be the 14th, third is the 21st, and the fourth would be the 28th. Wait, but wait, let me check again.

So that's the starting point.\n\nLet me list out the dates from August 28 to September 8 and note the days of the week. Starting with August 28 as Sunday.

September 1 is Thursday, September 2 is Friday, September 3 is Saturday, September 4 is Sunday, September 5 is Monday, September 6 is Tuesday, September 7 is Wednesday, and September 8 is Thursday.

Then the following Wednesday would be December 7. Are there any more? Let's check. December 1 is Thursday, so December 7 is the next Wednesday. Then December 14 would be the next one, but that's beyond the end date of December 7. So only two Wednesdays: November 30 and December 7. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. Let me count the days between November 24 and December 7. Let's see. From November 24 to November 30 is 6 days (including both start and end?), no. Wait, the start is November 24 (Thursday), and the end is December 7 (Wednesday). So the period includes all dates from November 24 to December 7, inclusive. So November 24 is day 1, November 25 day 2, ..., November 30 is day 7, December 1 is day 8, and so on up to December 7, which is day 14 (since November has 30 days, so from 24 to 30 is 7 days, then December 1-7 is 7 days, total 14 days). \n\nSo the total number of days is 14.

Wait, November 24 is Thursday. Then Friday (25), Saturday (26), Sunday (27), Monday (28), Tuesday (29), Wednesday (30). So November 30 is the first Wednesday. Then the next Wednesday is December 7.

Hmm, first, I should figure out the dates involved and then check each Wednesday in that range.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The start date is April 24, 2022, which is a Sunday. The end date is May 18, 2022, which is a Wednesday. So the period includes from April 24 (Sunday) up to May 18 (Wednesday), including both dates.\n\nNow, I need to count all the Wednesdays in this period. Let's start by finding the first Wednesday after April 24. Since April 24 is a Sunday, the next day is Monday (25th), then Tuesday (26th), Wednesday (27th). So the first Wednesday is April 27, 2022.\n\nThen, each subsequent Wednesday would be 7 days later. Let's list them out:\n\nApril 27 (Week 1)\nMay 4 (Week 2)\nMay 11 (Week 3)\nMay 18 (Week 4)\n\nWait, but the end date is May 18, which is a Wednesday. So that's included. Let me check if there are four Wednesdays in total. Let me count the days between April 27 and May 18.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 27 to April 30 is 4 days (27, 28, 29, 30). Then May 1 to May 18 is 18 days. So total days from April 27 to May 18 is 4 + 18 = 22 days. Divided by 7 days per week, that's 3 weeks and 1 day. So that would mean 3 full weeks (which is 3 Wednesdays) plus one more day. But since the first Wednesday is April 27, adding 7 days would be May 4, then May 11, then May 18. That's four Wednesdays. So the count should be 4.\n\nWait, but let me check each date again to make sure. April 27 is a Wednesday. Then adding 7 days: May 4 (Wednesday), May 11 (Wednesday), May 18 (Wednesday). That's three Wednesdays in May. But April 27 is the first one. So that's four in total. So the answer should be 4. Let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, calculate the total number of days between the start and end dates, then divide by 7 and check if there's a remainder. But since the start date is a Sunday, the first Wednesday is 3 days later. Let's see:\n\nFrom April 24 (Sunday) to April 27 (Wednesday) is 3 days. Then each week adds 7 days. The total number of days from April 24 to May 18 is (May 18 - April 24). Let's calculate that. April has 30 days, so from April 24 to April 30 is 6 days (since April 24 is day 0, then 25 is +1, ..., 30 is +6). Then May 1 to May 18 is 18 days. Total days is 6 + 18 = 24 days. So 24 days in total. Now, 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So there are 3 full weeks, which would have 3 Wednesdays, plus the first three days of the next week. Since the first day is Sunday (April 24), the first Wednesday is April 27 (day 3), then May 4 (day 10), May 11 (day 17), and May 18 (day 24). So that's four Wednesdays.

The question is asking: If the first day of the year was a Tuesday, what day of the week will March 26 be? And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so I need to figure out the day of the week for March 26, given that January 1st is a Tuesday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are there from January 1st to March 26th. Let me break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since the first day is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the first day of the year being a Tuesday. So if the year is not a leap year, February has 28 days. But if it is a leap year, February has 29. But the problem doesn't specify. Wait, maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year unless stated otherwise? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that doesn't require knowing if it's a leap year? Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the first day of the year was a Tuesday.\" So if the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, then the number of days between January 1 and March 26 would be different. So maybe the problem is assuming a non-leap year? Or maybe the question is from a specific context where the year is not a leap year. Hmm. Well, maybe I should check both possibilities? But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is probably assuming a non-leap year. Because if it's a leap year, the problem would have mentioned it. So I think I should proceed with the assumption that it's a non-leap year, so February has 28 days. So let's proceed with that.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to March 26th is January (31 days) + February (28 days) + March 26 days? Wait, no. Wait, the total days from January 1st to March 26th is (31 days in January) + (28 days in February) + 26 days in March? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 1 is day 1, January 2 is day 2, etc. So to get to March 26, we need to count the days from January 1 to March 26. So January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that, then March 26 is 26 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 26 (Mar) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 26 is 85 days. Wait, but wait, if January 1 is day 1, then the number of days between January 1 and March 26 is 85 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you count from January 1 to March 26 inclusive, that's 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But if you want the number of days between January 1 and March 26, not including January 1, then it's 84 days. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, you need to know how many days have passed since the starting day. So if January 1 is a Tuesday, then January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday). Then January 2 is day 1 (Wednesday), etc. So to find the day of the week for March 26, we need to calculate how many days are between January 1 and March 26, then take that number modulo 7, and add it to Tuesday.\n\nWait, but the exact number of days between January 1 and March 26. Let me think again. Let's count the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that, then March 26 is 26 days. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But if January 1 is day 1, then March 26 is day 85. But if we want to find how many days have passed since January 1, then it's 84 days. Because from day 1 to day 85 is 84 days later. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think of it as the number of days between January 1 and March 26. If January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday), then March 26 is day X. So the number of days between January 1 and March 26 is 85 - 1 = 84 days? Wait, no. Let me think of it as the number of days after January 1. So January 1 is day 0. Then January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31, February 28 is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1 is day 59, March 26 is day 59 + 25 = day 84. So March 26 is 84 days after January 1. Therefore, the number of days is 84. So 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. Therefore, March 26 would be the same day of the week as January 1, which is Tuesday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if January 1 is Tuesday, then adding 7 days (January 8) is also Tuesday. So adding 84 days (which is 12*7) would be Tuesday again. So March 26 would be a Tuesday? But that seems too easy. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later (since January 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days, that's 30 + 28 = 58 days later. Then March 26 is 26 days into March. So from March 1 to March 26 is 25 days later (since March 1 is day 59). So total days from January 1 is 58 + 25 = 83 days? Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, maybe I need to be more precise.\n\nLet me count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1 as day 0 (Tuesday). Then:\n\nJanuary 1: 0 days (Tuesday)\nJanuary 2: 1 day (Wednesday)\n...\nJanuary 31: 30 days (Tuesday + 30 days). Since 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 30 days later is Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 + 7 days is Tuesday again. So January 8 is Tuesday, January 15 is Tuesday, January 22 is Tuesday, January 29 is Tuesday. Then January 30 is Wednesday, January 31 is Thursday. So January 31 is Thursday. So that's 30 days after January 1. So that's correct.\n\nThen February 1 is day 31. So February 1 is day 31. Since 31 days after January 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 3 days after Tuesday is Friday. So February 1 is a Friday. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28 is also a Friday. Then March 1 is day 59 (31 + 28 = 59). So March 1 is day 59. 59 days after January 1. 59 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 3 days. So 3 days after Tuesday is Friday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, if February 28 is Friday, then March 1 is Saturday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 is day 0. January 8 is day 7 (Tuesday). January 15 is day 14 (Tuesday). January 22 is day 21 (Tuesday). January 29 is day 28 (Tuesday). Then January 30 is day 29 (Wednesday), January 31 is day 30 (Thursday). So February 1 is day 31. 31 days after January 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4*7=28, remainder 3. So 3 days after Tuesday is Friday. So February 1 is Friday. Then February 28 is 28 days later. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28 is also Friday. Then March 1 is the next day, which is Saturday. So March 1 is Saturday. Then March 26 is 25 days after March 1. Let's calculate 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So 4 days after Saturday is Wednesday. So March 26 would be Wednesday? Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought it was Tuesday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, earlier I thought that March 26 is 84 days after January 1. But according to this step-by-step, March 1 is day 31 (January 1 is day 0, so day 31 is February 1, day 59 is March 1). Wait, no. Wait, January has 31 days, so day 31 is February 1. Then February has 28 days, so day 31 + 28 = day 59 is March 1. So March 1 is day 59. Then March 26 is day 59 + 25 = day 84. So 84 days after January 1. 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks. So 84 days is exactly 12 weeks, so March 26 would be the same day as January 1, which is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step, March 1 is Saturday, and adding 25 days to that would be Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's check the step-by-step again. If March 1 is Saturday, then March 8 is Saturday, March 15 is Saturday, March 22 is Saturday, and March 29 is Saturday. So March 26 is three days before March 29, which is Wednesday. So March 26 is Wednesday. But according to the other calculation, 84 days later is Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the calculation of the number of days. Let me check again. If January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday), then day 31 is February 1. Then day 59 is March 1. So March 1 is day 59. Then March 26 is day 59 + 25 = day 84. So 84 days after day 0. 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 12 weeks. So day 84 is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step, March 1 is Saturday, and March 26 is Wednesday. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the step-by-step. Let me check the day of the week for March 1. If January 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 is day 0. January 8 is day 7 (Tuesday). January 15 is day 14 (Tuesday). January 22 is day 21 (Tuesday). January 29 is day 28 (Tuesday). Then January 30 is day 29 (Wednesday), January 31 is day 30 (Thursday). February 1 is day 31. 31 days after January 1. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 3 days after Tuesday is Friday. So February 1 is Friday. Then February 28 is 28 days later. 28 days is 4 weeks, so February 28 is also Friday. Then March 1 is the next day, which is Saturday. So March 1 is Saturday. Then March 26 is 25 days later. Let's count 25 days from March 1 (Saturday). 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So 4 days after Saturday is Wednesday. So March 26 is Wednesday. But according to the other calculation, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the assumption that day 84 is Tuesday. Let me check. If day 0 is Tuesday, then day 7 is Tuesday again. So day 7: Tuesday. Day 14: Tuesday. Day 21: Tuesday. Day 28: Tuesday. Day 35: Tuesday. Day 42: Tuesday. Day 49: Tuesday. Day 56: Tuesday. Day 63: Tuesday. Day 70: Tuesday. Day 77: Tuesday. Day 84: Tuesday. So according to this, day 84 is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step, March 26 is Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, the problem is that when I calculated the number of days from January 1 to March 26, I might have made a mistake. Let me check again. If March 1 is day 59, then March 26 is day 59 + 25 = day 84. But if March 1 is day 59, then day 59 is Saturday. So day 59 is Saturday. Then day 59 + 7 = day 66 is Saturday. Day 66 +7= day 73 Saturday. Day 73 +7= day 80 Saturday. Day 80 +7= day 87 Saturday. Wait, but day 84 is three days before day 87. So day 84 would be Wednesday. Because day 87 is Saturday, so day 84 is Wednesday. But according to the previous calculation, day 84 is Tuesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the calculations is wrong.\n\nWait, this is very confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let's use the fact that if January 1 is Tuesday, then I can calculate the day of the week for each month.\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Wednesday, January 31 is Thursday.\n\nFebruary 1 is Friday (since January 31 is Thursday, so February 1 is Friday). February has 28 days, so February 28 is Friday (since 28 days is 4 weeks). Then March 1 is Saturday.\n\nMarch 1 is Saturday. Now, March 26 is 25 days after March 1. Let's count the days:\n\nMarch 1: Saturday (day 0)\nMarch 2: Sunday (1)\nMarch 3: Monday (2)\nMarch 4: Tuesday (3)\nMarch 5: Wednesday (4)\nMarch 6: Thursday (5)\nMarch 7: Friday (6)\nMarch 8: Saturday (7)\nMarch 9: Sunday (8)\nMarch 10: Monday (9)\nMarch 11: Tuesday (10)\nMarch 12: Wednesday (11)\nMarch 13: Thursday (12)\nMarch 14: Friday (13)\nMarch 15: Saturday (14)\nMarch 16: Sunday (15)\nMarch 17: Monday (16)\nMarch 18: Tuesday (17)\nMarch 19: Wednesday (18)\nMarch 20: Thursday (19)\nMarch 21: Friday (20)\nMarch 22: Saturday (21)\nMarch 23: Sunday (22)\nMarch 24: Monday (23)\nMarch 25: Tuesday (24)\nMarch 26: Wednesday (25)\n\nSo March 26 is Wednesday. Therefore, the correct answer should be Wednesday. But according to the previous calculation where day 84 is Tuesday, that must be wrong. So where is the mistake in that calculation?\n\nAh! The mistake is in the assumption that day 84 is 84 days after January 1. But if March 1 is day 59, then March 26 is day 59 + 25 = day 84. But according to the step-by-step, day 59 is Saturday, and day 84 is Wednesday. So 84 days after January 1 is Wednesday. But earlier, I thought that 84 days is 12"], [74, "How many Wednesdays are there from Friday, December 2, 2022 to Wednesday, December 7, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Provide the count as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many Wednesdays there are from Friday, December 2, 2022, to Wednesday, December 7, 2022, inclusive. So I need to count all the Wednesdays in that date range.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the days of the week for each date in that period. Let me start by noting the starting date: Friday, December 2, 2022. Then the end date is Wednesday, December 7, 2022. The problem says inclusive of both dates, so both the start and end dates are included in the count.\n\nLet me list out each day from December 2 to December 7 and note their days of the week. \n\nStarting with December 2, 2022: that's a Friday. Then December 3 is Saturday, December 4 is Sunday, December 5 is Monday, December 6 is Tuesday, and December 7 is Wednesday. \n\nSo the dates are:\n\n- Dec 2: Friday\n- Dec 3: Saturday\n- Dec 4: Sunday\n- Dec 5: Monday\n- Dec 6: Tuesday\n- Dec 7: Wednesday\n\nNow, I need to check which of these days are Wednesdays. Looking at the list, December 7 is a Wednesday. The other days are not. So that's just one Wednesday. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The start date is Friday, so the first day is Friday. Then the next day is Saturday, then Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and then Wednesday on the 7th. So yes, only December 7 is a Wednesday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should confirm the actual days of the week for those dates. Sometimes when you're not sure, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me think. If December 2 is a Friday, then adding days:\n\n- 2: Friday\n- 3: Saturday\n- 4: Sunday\n- 5: Monday\n- 6: Tuesday\n- 7: Wednesday\n\nYes, that seems correct. So only one Wednesday in that period. Therefore, the answer should be 1.", "1"], [74, "If today is Thursday, February 3, 2022, what day of the week will it be in 84 days? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. Today is Thursday, February 3, 2022. I need to find out what day of the week it will be 84 days from today. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 84 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 84 divided by 7 is exactly 12. So that means 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 12 weeks to Thursday would still be Thursday, right? Because each week cycles every 7 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, the problem says today is February 3, 2022. Let me confirm if 2022 is a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also by 400. 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, so not a leap year. So February has 28 days. But since we're adding 84 days, maybe the exact date isn't necessary because the question is only about the day of the week. Since 84 is a multiple of 7, the day of the week should be the same. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify with a different method. Let's count the days step by step. Let's start from February 3, 2022, which is a Thursday. Let's add 7 days: February 10, 2022, also a Thursday. Then 17th, 24th, March 3rd, etc. Each week adds 7 days. So 12 weeks later would be 84 days. So adding 12 weeks to February 3, 2022, would be February 3 + 12 weeks. Let me check the date. February has 28 days, so adding 12 weeks (84 days) would take us to... Let's see, February 3 plus 28 days is March 3, 2022. Then another 28 days would be March 30, 2022. Then another 28 days would be April 27, 2022. Wait, but 12 weeks is 84 days. Wait, maybe I should check the exact date. Alternatively, maybe I can just rely on the fact that 84 divided by 7 is 12, so the day of the week is the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual calendar. But since I don't have that here, I need to rely on the math. Since 84 is a multiple of 7, the day of the week should be the same. Therefore, 84 days from Thursday is also a Thursday. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check for any possible errors. For example, if the date crosses into a different month or year, but since 84 days from February 3, 2022, would be... Let's calculate. February has 28 days, so from February 3 to February 28 is 25 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding 25 + 31 = 56 days. Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days would be 56 + 30 = 86 days. Wait, that's 86 days. So 84 days would be 2 days before April 30. So 84 days from February 3 is March 30, 2022? Wait, maybe I need to check again. Let me count step by step. \n\nStarting from February 3, 2022. Let's add 28 days to get to March 3, 2022. Then another 28 days would be March 30, 2022. Then another 28 days would be April 27, 2022. Wait, that's 84 days. Wait, 28 + 28 + 28 is 84. So March 3 + 28 days is March 30, then March 30 + 28 days is April 27. So 84 days from February 3 is April 27, 2022. But the day of the week would be the same as February 3, which is Thursday. So the answer should be Thursday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. Let's take the number of days and divide by 7. 84 divided by 7 is 12, so remainder 0. So adding 0 days to Thursday would still be Thursday. Therefore, the answer is Thursday.", "Thursday"], [74, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Monday, October 3, 2022 to Tuesday, October 25, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Respond with just the number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Monday, October 3, 2022, to Tuesday, October 25, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. October 3, 2022 is a Monday. October 25, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't do that, I'll have to calculate it. Let's see, October has 31 days. So from October 3 to October 25 is 25 - 3 = 22 days, but since both dates are inclusive, it's 22 + 1 = 23 days total? Wait, no. Wait, if you have two dates, the number of days between them inclusive is (end date - start date) + 1. So October 3 to October 25 is 25 - 3 = 22 days difference, so 22 + 1 = 23 days total. But I need to check if that's correct. Let me think: from October 3 to October 4 is 2 days (inclusive). So yes, the formula is correct. So total days is 23.\n\nNow, out of these 23 days, how many are weekends? Let's list the days. Starting from October 3 (Monday), then October 4 (Tuesday), 5 (Wednesday), 6 (Thursday), 7 (Friday), 8 (Saturday), 9 (Sunday), 10 (Monday), and so on.\n\nSo the weekends would be Saturdays and Sundays. Let's count how many weekends are in this period.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many weeks are in the period. Since 23 days is about 3 weeks and 2 days. Let me check:\n\nFrom October 3 (Monday) to October 9 (Sunday) is 7 days. Then October 10 is Monday again. So the first week is 3-9 (7 days), then 10-16 (another 7 days), then 17-23 (another 7 days). Wait, but October 25 is the end date. Wait, October 3 is day 1, October 4 is day 2, ..., October 9 is day 7. Then October 10 is day 8, October 11 day 9, October 12 day 10, October 13 day 11, October 14 day 12, October 15 day 13, October 16 day 14. Then October 17 is day 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 (October 25 is day 23). Wait, October 25 is the 23rd day. So the period is from day 1 (Mon) to day 23 (Tue). So the weeks would be:\n\nWeek 1: 3-9 (Mon to Sun)\nWeek 2: 10-16 (Mon to Sun)\nWeek 3: 17-23 (Mon to Tue)\n\nSo in week 1, there are 2 weekend days: Saturday (8th) and Sunday (9th). Week 2: same, Saturday (16th) and Sunday (17th? Wait, no. Wait, week 2 starts on October 10 (Monday) and ends on October 16 (Sunday). So Saturday is October 15th, Sunday October 16th. Then week 3 starts on October 17 (Monday) and ends on October 23 (Tuesday). So in week 3, there are no weekends because it ends on Tuesday. So the weekends in the entire period are October 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun). That's 4 weekend days.\n\nSo total business days would be 23 total days minus 4 weekend days = 19 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me list each day from October 3 to October 25 and count the weekends.\n\nOctober 3: Monday (business)\n4: Tuesday (business)\n5: Wednesday (business)\n6: Thursday (business)\n7: Friday (business)\n8: Saturday (non-business)\n9: Sunday (non-business)\n10: Monday (business)\n11: Tuesday (business)\n12: Wednesday (business)\n13: Thursday (business)\n14: Friday (business)\n15: Saturday (non-business)\n16: Sunday (non-business)\n17: Monday (business)\n18: Tuesday (business)\n19: Wednesday (business)\n20: Thursday (business)\n21: Friday (business)\n22: Saturday (non-business)\n23: Sunday (non-business) Wait, wait, but the end date is October 25, which is Tuesday. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, the total days are 23, but when I list them, I might have miscalculated the dates.\n\nWait, October 3 is day 1. Then October 4 is day 2, ..., October 9 is day 7. Then October 10 is day 8, October 11 day 9, October 12 day 10, October 13 day 11, October 14 day 12, October 15 day 13, October 16 day 14. Then October 17 is day 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 (October 25 is day 23). Wait, October 25 is the 23rd day. So October 17 is day 15, October 18 day 16, October 19 day 17, October 20 day 18, October 21 day 19, October 22 day 20, October 23 day 21, October 24 day 22, October 25 day 23. Wait, that's 23 days. So October 25 is day 23, which is Tuesday. So the days from 3 to 25 inclusive are 23 days. So the weekends would be:\n\nLooking at each day:\n\nOctober 8 (Sat) - day 6 (since day 1 is Oct 3, day 6 is Oct 8)\nWait, maybe I should list each day with the date and check.\n\nLet me list the dates:\n\nDay 1: Oct 3 (Mon)\nDay 2: Oct 4 (Tue)\nDay 3: Oct 5 (Wed)\nDay 4: Oct 6 (Thu)\nDay 5: Oct 7 (Fri)\nDay 6: Oct 8 (Sat)\nDay 7: Oct 9 (Sun)\nDay 8: Oct 10 (Mon)\nDay 9: Oct 11 (Tue)\nDay 10: Oct 12 (Wed)\nDay 11: Oct 13 (Thu)\nDay 12: Oct 14 (Fri)\nDay 13: Oct 15 (Sat)\nDay 14: Oct 16 (Sun)\nDay 15: Oct 17 (Mon)\nDay 16: Oct 18 (Tue)\nDay 17: Oct 19 (Wed)\nDay 18: Oct 20 (Thu)\nDay 19: Oct 21 (Fri)\nDay 20: Oct 22 (Sat)\nDay 21: Oct 23 (Sun)\nDay 22: Oct 24 (Mon)\nDay 23: Oct 25 (Tue)\n\nSo the weekends are days 6 (Sat), 7 (Sun), 13 (Sat), 14 (Sun), 20 (Sat), 21 (Sun). Wait, that's 6 weekend days. Wait, but earlier I thought there were 4. So where did I go wrong before?\n\nWait, in the previous calculation, I thought that the period was up to October 25, which is day 23. So the weekends would be:\n\nOct 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun), 22 (Sat), 23 (Sun)? Wait, but October 23 is a Sunday, and October 25 is Tuesday. Wait, October 22 is Saturday (day 20), October 23 is Sunday (day 21), October 24 is Monday (day 22), October 25 is Tuesday (day 23). So the weekends are days 6,7,13,14,20,21. That's 6 days. So total business days would be 23 - 6 = 17.\n\nBut earlier I thought there were 4 weekend days. So that was a mistake. So why the discrepancy?\n\nBecause I had miscalculated the number of weekends. Let me recount. The first week (days 1-7) includes Sat (day 6) and Sun (day 7). The second week (days 8-14) includes Sat (day 13) and Sun (day 14). The third week (days 15-21) includes Sat (day 20) and Sun (day 21). Then day 22 is Monday, day 23 is Tuesday. So that's 6 weekend days. Therefore, 23 total days minus 6 weekends equals 17 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me list all the dates and mark weekends:\n\nOct 3 (Mon) - business\nOct 4 (Tue) - business\nOct 5 (Wed) - business\nOct 6 (Thu) - business\nOct 7 (Fri) - business\nOct 8 (Sat) - non-business\nOct 9 (Sun) - non-business\nOct 10 (Mon) - business\nOct 11 (Tue) - business\nOct 12 (Wed) - business\nOct 13 (Thu) - business\nOct 14 (Fri) - business\nOct 15 (Sat) - non-business\nOct 16 (Sun) - non-business\nOct 17 (Mon) - business\nOct 18 (Tue) - business\nOct 19 (Wed) - business\nOct 20 (Thu) - business\nOct 21 (Fri) - business\nOct 22 (Sat) - non-business\nOct 23 (Sun) - non-business\nOct 24 (Mon) - business\nOct 25 (Tue) - business\n\nWait, but wait, October 25 is day 23. So the list above is from day 1 (Oct 3) to day 23 (Oct 25). Let me count the non-business days:\n\nOct 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun), 22 (Sat), 23 (Sun). That's 6 days. So 23 total days minus 6 non-business days equals 17 business days.\n\nBut wait, in the list above, Oct 23 is Sunday, which is day 21. Wait, no. Wait, day 21 is Oct 23? Let me check again. Let me count the days:\n\nDay 1: Oct 3\nDay 2: Oct 4\nDay 3: Oct 5\nDay 4: Oct 6\nDay 5: Oct 7\nDay 6: Oct 8\nDay 7: Oct 9\nDay 8: Oct 10\nDay 9: Oct 11\nDay 10: Oct 12\nDay 11: Oct 13\nDay 12: Oct 14\nDay 13: Oct 15\nDay 14: Oct 16\nDay 15: Oct 17\nDay 16: Oct 18\nDay 17: Oct 19\nDay 18: Oct 20\nDay 19: Oct 21\nDay 20: Oct 22\nDay 21: Oct 23\nDay 22: Oct 24\nDay 23: Oct 25\n\nYes, so day 21 is Oct 23 (Sunday), day 22 is Oct 24 (Monday), day 23 is Oct 25 (Tuesday). So the non-business days are Oct 8,9,15,16,22,23. That's 6 days. So 23-6=17 business days.\n\nBut wait, in the list above, when I listed the dates, I had Oct 23 as Sunday (non-business), and Oct 25 as Tuesday (business). So that's correct. So the answer should be 17.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check another way. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, etc., between the dates.\n\nFrom Oct 3 (Monday) to Oct 25 (Tuesday). Let's count the number of each weekday.\n\nFirst, how many weeks are there between these dates? From Oct 3 to Oct 25 is 22 days difference, so 3 weeks and 1 day. Wait, 22 days is 3 weeks (21 days) plus 1 day. So starting from Monday, adding 3 weeks (21 days) would be Oct 3 + 21 days = Oct 24 (Monday). Then adding 1 day would be Oct 25 (Tuesday). So the period includes 3 full weeks (21 days) plus 2 days (Oct 24 and 25). Wait, but the total days are 23. So 21 days is 3 weeks, then 2 more days. So in the 3 weeks, there are 3 Mondays, 3 Tuesdays, etc. Then the extra days are Monday (Oct 24) and Tuesday (Oct 25). So total Mondays: 3 + 1 = 4. Tuesdays: 3 + 1 = 4. Wednesdays: 3. Thursdays: 3. Fridays: 3. Saturdays: 3. Sundays: 3. Wait, but that can't be right because the total days would be 4+4+3+3+3+3+3 = 23? Let me check:\n\nMondays: 4\nTuesdays: 4\nWednesdays: 3\nThursdays: 3\nFridays: 3\nSaturdays: 3\nSundays: 3\nTotal: 4+4=8, 3+3+3+3+3=15, total 8+15=23. Yes. So the number of business days is the sum of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays. So that's 4+4+3+3+3 = 17. So that's 17 business days. So that confirms the previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 17.", "17"], [74, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Thursday, February 10, 2022 to Saturday, March 12, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. February 10, 2022 is a Thursday. Let's confirm that. Wait, I think I remember that February 10, 2022 was a Thursday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can count the days from a known date. For example, if I know that February 10 is a Thursday, then February 11 is Friday, 12 is Saturday, 13 is Sunday, 14 is Monday, and so on.\n\nSo the start date is Thursday, February 10. The end date is Saturday, March 12. Let me figure out how many days are in between.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of days from February 10 to March 12 inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nFebruary has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. So from February 10 to February 28 is 28 - 10 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to add 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I start on February 10, that's day 1. Then February 11 is day 2, etc. So from February 10 to February 28 inclusive is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total days would be 19 + 12 = 31 days. But wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, February 10 to February 28: February 10 is day 1, February 11 is day 2, ..., February 28 is day 19. Then March 1 is day 20, March 2 is 21, ..., March 12 is day 31. So total of 31 days. So the total days between the two dates inclusive is 31 days.\n\nNow, out of these 31 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nLet me list the days starting from February 10 (Thursday). Let's count the weekends.\n\nFebruary 10 is Thursday. Then:\n\nFebruary 11: Friday (business day)\nFebruary 12: Saturday (non-business)\nFebruary 13: Sunday (non-business)\nFebruary 14: Monday (business)\nFebruary 15: Tuesday (business)\nFebruary 16: Wednesday (business)\nFebruary 17: Thursday (business)\nFebruary 18: Friday (business)\nFebruary 19: Saturday (non-business)\nFebruary 20: Sunday (non-business)\nFebruary 21: Monday (business)\nFebruary 22: Tuesday (business)\nFebruary 23: Wednesday (business)\nFebruary 24: Thursday (business)\nFebruary 25: Friday (business)\nFebruary 26: Saturday (non-business)\nFebruary 27: Sunday (non-business)\nFebruary 28: Monday (business)\nMarch 1: Tuesday (business)\nMarch 2: Wednesday (business)\nMarch 3: Thursday (business)\nMarch 4: Friday (business)\nMarch 5: Saturday (non-business)\nMarch 6: Sunday (non-business)\nMarch 7: Monday (business)\nMarch 8: Tuesday (business)\nMarch 9: Wednesday (business)\nMarch 10: Thursday (business)\nMarch 11: Friday (business)\nMarch 12: Saturday (non-business)\n\nNow, let's count the non-business days (Saturdays and Sundays) in this list.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\nFebruary 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat). Wait, wait, March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday, March 12 is Saturday. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the list above:\n\nFrom February 10 to March 12:\n\nSaturdays are:\n\nFebruary 12, 19, 26, March 5, March 12.\n\nSundays are:\n\nFebruary 13, 20, 27, March 6.\n\nWait, let me count each:\n\nFebruary 12 (Sat) - 1\nFebruary 13 (Sun) - 1\nFebruary 19 (Sat) - 2\nFebruary 20 (Sun) - 2\nFebruary 26 (Sat) - 3\nFebruary 27 (Sun) - 3\nMarch 5 (Sat) - 4\nMarch 6 (Sun) - 4\nMarch 12 (Sat) - 5\n\nSo that's 5 Saturdays and 4 Sundays, total of 9 non-business days. Therefore, the total business days would be 31 total days minus 9 non-business days = 22 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I missed some days. Let me recount the non-business days.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\nFebruary 12 (Sat) - 1\nFebruary 13 (Sun) - 2\nFebruary 19 (Sat) - 3\nFebruary 20 (Sun) - 4\nFebruary 26 (Sat) - 5\nFebruary 27 (Sun) - 6\nMarch 5 (Sat) - 7\nMarch 6 (Sun) - 8\nMarch 12 (Sat) - 9\n\nYes, that's 9 non-business days. So 31 total days minus 9 = 22 business days. But wait, let me check another way. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from February 10 (Thursday) to March 12 (Saturday). Let's count each week.\n\nFrom February 10 (Thu) to February 14 (Mon) is 5 days. That's 3 business days (Thu, Fri, Mon) and 2 weekends (Sat, Sun). Wait, no. Wait, from Thu (10) to Mon (14) is 5 days. So:\n\nThu (10) - business\nFri (11) - business\nSat (12) - non\nSun (13) - non\nMon (14) - business\n\nSo that's 3 business days in the first week.\n\nThen February 15 (Tue) to February 18 (Fri): 4 days. All business days. So 4 days.\n\nFebruary 19 (Sat) - non, 20 (Sun) - non, 21 (Mon) - business, 22 (Tue) - business, 23 (Wed) - business, 24 (Thu) - business, 25 (Fri) - business. So from 19 to 25 is 7 days. Non-business days are 19 and 20, so 2 non-business, 5 business.\n\nThen March 1 (Mon) to March 5 (Fri): 5 days. All business days. Then March 6 (Sat) - non, March 7 (Sun) - non, March 8 (Mon) - business, 9 (Tue), 10 (Wed), 11 (Thu), 12 (Fri). So from March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. Let's break it down:\n\nMarch 1-5: 5 business days.\n\nMarch 6-7: 2 non-business.\n\nMarch 8-12: 5 business days.\n\nSo total for March: 5 + 5 = 10 business days.\n\nNow adding up:\n\nFirst week (Feb 10-14): 3 business days.\n\nSecond week (Feb 15-18): 4.\n\nThird week (Feb 19-25): 5.\n\nMarch 1-5: 5.\n\nMarch 8-12: 5.\n\nTotal: 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 22.

Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week January 17, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a known reference.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I should use a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, but how does that help me? Let me think. If I can find a date that I know the weekday for, and then count the days between that date and January 17, 2022, I can figure out the weekday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. If I recall, 2022 started on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then January 17 would be 16 days later. Since 7 days is a week, 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Sunday would be Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean January 17, 2022 was a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let's count the days. January 1 is Sunday. Then January 2 is Monday, January 3 is Tuesday, and so on. So January 17 would be 16 days after January 1. Let's divide 16 by 7. 7*2=14, so 16-14=2. So two days after Sunday is Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should cross-verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but how does that help? Wait, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check an online source. Wait, I can't actually access the internet, but I can rely on my memory. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. So adding 16 days would be 2 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. Therefore, January 17, 2022 was a Tuesday. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check another date. For example, if I know that January 24, 2022 was a Monday, then January 17 would be 7 days earlier, which would be Monday minus 7 days, which is Monday again. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, if January 24 is Monday, then January 17 would be 7 days before, which would also be Monday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, that can't be right. So maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check another way. Let me think about the year 2022. If I remember correctly, January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. But if that's the case, then January 8 would be Sunday again, January 15 would be Sunday, and January 22 would be Sunday. So January 17 would be two days before Sunday, which is Friday. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, this is confusing. Let me try again.\n\nIf January 1 is Sunday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\n\nJanuary 2: Monday\n\nJanuary 3: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 4: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 5: Thursday\n\nJanuary 6: Friday\n\nJanuary 7: Saturday\n\nJanuary 8: Sunday\n\nJanuary 9: Monday\n\nJanuary 10: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 11: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 12: Thursday\n\nJanuary 13: Friday\n\nJanuary 14: Saturday\n\nJanuary 15: Sunday\n\nJanuary 16: Monday\n\nJanuary 17: Tuesday\n\nWait, so according to this, January 17 would be Tuesday. But earlier when I thought that January 24 was Monday, that would mean that January 17 is 7 days before, which would be Monday. But that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that January 24 is Monday. Let me check again. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday, 15 is Sunday, 22 is Sunday. So January 22 is Sunday. Then January 23 is Monday, 24 is Tuesday. So January 24 is Tuesday, not Monday. So that would mean that January 17 is Tuesday. So that's consistent. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week each of these dates falls on. \n\nWait, the start date is Monday, December 26. So that's a Monday. Then December 27 is Tuesday, 28 is Wednesday, 29 is Thursday, and 30 is Friday. So the dates in question are Monday (26th), Tuesday (27th), Wednesday (28th), Thursday (29th), and Friday (30th). \n\nSo within this period, the only Thursday is the 29th. Let me double-check. December 26 is Monday. Adding days: 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri). Yes, that's correct.

And I need to answer with the full weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. Since January 1st is a Wednesday, January 1st is day 0. Then, January 2nd is day 1, and so on. But maybe it's easier to count the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive or exclusive? Wait, the question is about April 3rd, so I need to count the days from January 1st to April 3rd, but since we're looking for the day of the week, it's the number of days between them.\n\nWait, actually, if January 1st is a Wednesday, then the next day, January 2nd, is Thursday. So each day after that adds one day. So to find April 3rd, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd, then find the remainder when divided by 7, and add that to Wednesday.\n\nSo let's calculate the number of days. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So maybe it's not a leap year? Or maybe it's a leap year? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Wait, but maybe the answer is the same regardless? Or maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year? Because if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is the same regardless? Wait, but maybe the problem is in a specific year where January 1st is a Wednesday. But since the problem doesn't mention leap years, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if it's a non-leap year, then February has 28 days. March has 31 days, and April has 30 days. So from January 1st to April 3rd, how many days?\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 3 is 92 days. Wait, but wait, that's the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive? Or is that the number of days after January 1st?\n\nWait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 92 days. Wait, but if I count from January 1st (inclusive) to April 3rd (inclusive), that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 93 days. But if I want the number of days after January 1st, then it's 92 days. Because January 1st is day 0, so April 3rd is 92 days later. So the total days between them is 92 days. So to find the day of the week, I can take 92 divided by 7, find the remainder, and add that to Wednesday.\n\nSo 92 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7*13 is 91, so 92 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So the remainder is 1. So adding 1 day to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday. So April 3rd would be a Thursday?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because if January 1st is Wednesday, then January 1st is day 0. Then January 8th is also a Wednesday (7 days later). So each week cycles every 7 days. So if I have 92 days later, that's 13 weeks (91 days) plus 1 day. So 91 days later is the same day, Wednesday. Then 92 days later is one day after Wednesday, which is Thursday. So April 3rd would be a Thursday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. Let's check the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. But if January 1st is day 0, then January 31st is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days, so February 28th is day 30 + 28 = 58. Then March has 31 days, so March 31st is day 58 + 31 = 89. Then April 1st is day 90, April 2nd is 91, April 3rd is 92. So yes, April 3rd is day 92. So 92 days after January 1st. So 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Wednesday is Thursday. So the answer should be Thursday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step for each month.\n\nJanuary 1st is Wednesday. Let's count the days for each month:\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So January 1st is Wednesday. Then January 8th is Wednesday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Wednesday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th, April 2nd. Wait, so April 2nd is a Wednesday. Then April 3rd is Thursday. So that's the same answer. So that seems to confirm that April 3rd is Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another approach. Let's count the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's see:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March 31, and April 3 days. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. Wait, but that's if you include both start and end dates. But if you start on January 1st (day 1), then the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 93 - 1 = 92 days. So that's the same as before. So 92 days later. So 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Wednesday is Thursday. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Thursday.", "Thursday"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 10 to Tuesday, June 14, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates.\n\nStarting with April 10, 2022. That's a Sunday. So the first day is a Sunday, which is a weekend. Then April 11 is Monday (weekday), April 12 Tuesday, 13 Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, and so on. \n\nBut maybe I should break it down month by month. Let's see:\n\nApril 10 to April 30. Then May 1 to May 31, and June 1 to June 14.\n\nFirst, April 10 is Sunday. Let's count the days in April. April has 30 days. So from April 10 to April 30 is 21 days (including both start and end). Wait, no. Wait, April 10 to April 30 is 30 - 10 = 20 days, but since we include both start and end, it's 21 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have from day 1 to day 3, that's 3 days. So from day 10 to day 30 is 30 - 10 + 1 = 21 days. So that's 21 days in April.\n\nNow, let's count the weekdays in April. April 10 is Sunday. So the next day, April 11 is Monday. Let's list the days:\n\nApril 10: Sunday (weekend)\nApril 11: Monday (weekday)\nApril 12: Tuesday (weekday)\nApril 13: Wednesday (weekday)\nApril 14: Thursday (weekday)\nApril 15: Friday (weekday)\nApril 16: Saturday (weekend)\nApril 17: Sunday (weekend)\nApril 18: Monday (weekday)\nApril 19: Tuesday (weekday)\nApril 20: Wednesday (weekday)\nApril 21: Thursday (weekday)\nApril 22: Friday (weekday)\nApril 23: Saturday (weekend)\nApril 24: Sunday (weekend)\nApril 25: Monday (weekday)\nApril 26: Tuesday (weekday)\nApril 27: Wednesday (weekday)\nApril 28: Thursday (weekday)\nApril 29: Friday (weekday)\nApril 30: Saturday (weekend)\n\nSo in April, from April 10 to April 30, how many weekdays? Let's count:\n\nFrom April 11 to April 15: 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri)\nThen April 18-22: 5 weekdays\nApril 25-29: 5 weekdays\nThat's 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 weekdays in April.\n\nWait, but April 30 is Saturday, so that's not included. So that's correct.\n\nNow May. May has 31 days. Let's check the first day of May. April 30 is Saturday, so May 1 is Sunday. Wait, April 30 is Saturday, so May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday (weekend), May 2 is Monday (weekday), and so on.\n\nSo May 1 to May 31. Let's count the weekdays. Since May 1 is Sunday, the first weekday is May 2. Let's see how many weeks there are in May. May has 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, plus 3 days. So in 4 weeks, there are 4*5=20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days are May 29 (Monday), May 30 (Tuesday), May 31 (Wednesday). So that's 3 weekdays. So total weekdays in May would be 20 + 3 = 23.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. May 1 is Sunday. So the first week of May has May 1 (Sunday), May 2 (Monday), May 3 (Tuesday), May 4 (Wednesday), May 5 (Thursday), May 6 (Friday), May 7 (Saturday). So that's 6 days. Then the next week starts May 8 (Sunday), and so on. So in May, the first week (May 1-7) has 2 weekdays (Monday to Friday). Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Sunday, so the first weekday is May 2 (Monday), then May 3 (Tuesday), May 4 (Wednesday), May 5 (Thursday), May 6 (Friday). That's 5 weekdays in the first week. Then May 7 is Saturday. Then the next week starts May 8 (Sunday), and so on. So each week has 5 weekdays. So 4 weeks would be 20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days (May 29, 30, 31) are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So that's 3 more weekdays. So total 23 weekdays in May. That seems correct.\n\nNow June. June 1 is Thursday (since May 31 is Wednesday, so June 1 is Thursday). Wait, May 31 is Wednesday.

But the original question says the end date is Tuesday, June 14. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the actual dates for 2022.\n\nWait, the user said the end date is Tuesday, June 14, 2022. So maybe I need to check if June 14, 2022 is actually a Tuesday. Let me confirm. Let me check a calendar. Alternatively, I can calculate.\n\nApril 10, 2022 is a Sunday. Let's count the days. April has 30 days, so April 10 to April 30 is 21 days. Then May has 31 days, so May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total days from April 10 to June 14 is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, the total days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is (April 10 to April 30) is 21 days, then May 1 to May 31 is 31 days, then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. But that's the total days. But the user says the end date is Tuesday, June 14. So if June 14 is Tuesday, then June 1 is Thursday (since June 1 is Thursday, then June 14 is 13 days later. Let's count: June 1 (Thu), 2 (Fri), 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed). Wait, that's 13 days later. So June 14 would be Wednesday. But the user says it's Tuesday. That's a contradiction. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check the actual dates.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual calendar for 2022. Let me think. April 10, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me check what day June 14, 2022 is. Let's count the days from April 10 to June 14.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 10 to April 30 is 21 days. Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total days from April 10 to June 14 is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. But that's the total days. Now, since April 10 is a Sunday, adding 66 days. Let's compute the day of the week. 66 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 3 days. So 9 weeks later is the same day, Sunday, plus 3 days: Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So June 14, 2022 is a Wednesday. But the user says it's Tuesday. That's conflicting. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake. But assuming the problem is correct, perhaps I need to check again. Alternatively, maybe the start date is Sunday, April 10, and the end date is Tuesday, June 14. So maybe the end date is actually June 13? Let me check. If June 14 is Wednesday, then June 13 is Tuesday. So maybe the user made a typo. But the problem says June 14 is Tuesday. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the day of the week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check online. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can use my knowledge. Let me think. April 10, 2022 is a Sunday. Let's count the days:\n\nApril 10 (Sun)\nApril 11 (Mon)\nApril 12 (Tue)\nApril 13 (Wed)\nApril 14 (Thu)\nApril 15 (Fri)\nApril 16 (Sat)\nApril 17 (Sun)\nApril 18 (Mon)\nApril 19 (Tue)\nApril 20 (Wed)\nApril 21 (Thu)\nApril 22 (Fri)\nApril 23 (Sat)\nApril 24 (Sun)\nApril 25 (Mon)\nApril 26 (Tue)\nApril 27 (Wed)\nApril 28 (Thu)\nApril 29 (Fri)\nApril 30 (Sat)\n\nSo April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. May 2 is Monday. May 3 is Tuesday. May 4 is Wednesday. May 5 is Thursday. May 6 is Friday. May 7 is Saturday. May 8 is Sunday. May 9 is Monday. May 10 is Tuesday. May 11 is Wednesday. May 12 is Thursday. May 13 is Friday. May 14 is Saturday. May 15 is Sunday. May 16 is Monday. May 17 is Tuesday. May 18 is Wednesday. May 19 is Thursday. May 20 is Friday. May 21 is Saturday. May 22 is Sunday. May 23 is Monday. May 24 is Tuesday. May 25 is Wednesday. May 26 is Thursday. May 27 is Friday. May 28 is Saturday. May 29 is Sunday. May 30 is Monday. May 31 is Tuesday.\n\nSo May 31 is Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. June 2 is Thursday. June 3 is Friday. June 4 is Saturday. June 5 is Sunday. June 6 is Monday. June 7 is Tuesday. June 8 is Wednesday. June 9 is Thursday. June 10 is Friday. June 11 is Saturday. June 12 is Sunday. June 13 is Monday. June 14 is Tuesday. Oh! Wait, so June 14 is Tuesday. So my previous calculation was wrong. So June 1 is Wednesday. So June 14 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So my mistake earlier was in the calculation of the day of the week. So June 1 is Wednesday, not Thursday. So that changes things.\n\nSo let's redo the June part. June 1 is Wednesday. The end date is June 14, which is Tuesday. So let's count the weekdays from June 1 to June 14.\n\nJune 1: Wednesday (weekday)\nJune 2: Thursday (weekday)\nJune 3: Friday (weekday)\nJune 4: Saturday (weekend)\nJune 5: Sunday (weekend)\nJune 6: Monday (weekday)\nJune 7: Tuesday (weekday)\nJune 8: Wednesday (weekday)\nJune 9: Thursday (weekday)\nJune 10: Friday (weekday)\nJune 11: Saturday (weekend)\nJune 12: Sunday (weekend)\nJune 13: Monday (weekday)\nJune 14: Tuesday (weekday)\n\nSo from June 1 to June 14, how many weekdays? Let's count:\n\nJune 1 (Wed), 2 (Thu), 3 (Fri) \u2192 3 weekdays\nJune 6 (Mon), 7 (Tue), 8 (Wed), 9 (Thu), 10 (Fri) \u2192 5 weekdays\nJune 13 (Mon), 14 (Tue) \u2192 2 weekdays\nTotal: 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 weekdays in June.\n\nSo now, adding up the weekdays:\n\nApril: 15\nMay: 23\nJune: 10\nTotal: 15 + 23 = 38, plus 10 is 48.\n\nWait, but let me check again. April had 15 weekdays, May 23, June 10. 15+23 is 38, plus 10 is 48. But let me check again the counts for each month.\n\nApril: From April 10 to April 30. The days were:\n\nApril 10 (Sun) \u2192 weekend\nApril 11 (Mon) \u2192 weekday\nApril 12 (Tue) \u2192 weekday\nApril 13 (Wed) \u2192 weekday\nApril 14 (Thu) \u2192 weekday\nApril 15 (Fri) \u2192 weekday\nApril 16 (Sat) \u2192 weekend\nApril 17 (Sun) \u2192 weekend\nApril 18 (Mon) \u2192 weekday\nApril 19 (Tue) \u2192 weekday\nApril 20 (Wed) \u2192 weekday\nApril 21 (Thu) \u2192 weekday\nApril 22 (Fri) \u2192 weekday\nApril 23 (Sat) \u2192 weekend\nApril 24 (Sun) \u2192 weekend\nApril 25 (Mon) \u2192 weekday\nApril 26 (Tue) \u2192 weekday\nApril 27 (Wed) \u2192 weekday\nApril 28 (Thu) \u2192 weekday\nApril 29 (Fri) \u2192 weekday\nApril 30 (Sat) \u2192 weekend\n\nSo that's 15 weekdays. Let's count them:\n\nFrom April 11-15: 5\nApril 18-22: 5\nApril 25-29: 5\nTotal 15. Correct.\n\nMay: 23 weekdays. Let's check again. May 1 is Sunday. So the first week (May 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri). Then each subsequent week has 5 weekdays. May has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4*5=20, plus 3 days (May 29, 30, 31) which are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So 20+3=23. Correct.\n\nJune: 10 weekdays. Let's check again:\n\nJune 1 (Wed), 2 (Thu), 3 (Fri) \u2192 3\nJune 6 (Mon), 7 (Tue), 8 (Wed), 9 (Thu), 10 (Fri) \u2192 5\nJune 13 (Mon), 14 (Tue) \u2192 2\nTotal 3+5+2=10. Correct.\n\nSo total is 15+23+10=48. But wait, the start date is April 10 (Sunday) and the end date is June 14 (Tuesday). So the total days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is 66 days. But the number of weekdays is 48. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days and subtract the weekends.\n\nTotal days: 66. Number of weekends: 66 - 48 = 18. Let's check if that's correct. Let's count the weekends.\n\nApril: From April 10 to"], [74, "What day of the week was December 20, 2022? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week December 20, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I should use another method. Alternatively, I can use the fact that December 20, 2022 is a certain number of days before or after a known date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Wait, I think I remember that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. If that's the case, then December 20 would be two days before that. So if December 21 is Wednesday, then December 20 would be Tuesday. But wait, I need to make sure that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach. Let's think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. If that's the case, then I can count the days from there.\n\nSo, January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then, December 20, 2022 is 365 days later? Wait, no, 2022 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days. But I need to calculate the number of days between January 1, 2022 and December 20, 2022. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the days from a known date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 20, 2022 is 20 days before December 31, 2022. If I can find out what day December 31, 2022 was, then subtract 20 days. But how do I find that?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if I can confirm that, then December 20 would be Tuesday. But how do I know that? Maybe I can check the days of the week for some other dates. For example, I know that December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 1 is Thursday, so December 2 is Friday, December 3 is Saturday, December 4 is Sunday, December 5 is Monday, December 6 is Tuesday, December 7 is Wednesday, December 8 is Thursday, and so on. Wait, but if December 1 is Thursday, then December 8 is Thursday again. Then December 15 is Thursday, and December 22 is Thursday. So December 22 is Thursday. Therefore, December 21 would be Wednesday, and December 20 would be Tuesday. So that would make December 20, 2022 a Tuesday. But I need to confirm that December 1, 2022 was indeed a Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I count the days from December 31, 2022 to January 1, 2023, that's one day. So December 31, 2022 was a Saturday. Because if January 1 is Sunday, then December 31 is Saturday. Then, December 31 is Saturday. So December 30 is Friday, December 29 is Thursday, December 28 is Wednesday, December 27 is Tuesday, December 26 is Monday, December 25 is Sunday, December 24 is Saturday, December 23 is Friday, December 22 is Thursday, December 21 is Wednesday, December 20 is Tuesday. So that would make December 20, 2022 a Tuesday. So that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the fact that December 31, 2022 was a Saturday, then going back 20 days would be December 20. Let's count 20 days back from December 31. December has 31 days, so December 31 minus 20 days is December 11. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if I go back 20 days from December 31, 2022, that would be December 11, 2022. Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I should count the days step by step. Let's see:\n\nDecember 31 is Saturday.\n\nDecember 30: Friday\n\nDecember 29: Thursday\n\nDecember 28: Wednesday\n\nDecember 27: Tuesday\n\nDecember 26: Monday\n\nDecember 25: Sunday\n\nDecember 24: Saturday\n\nDecember 23: Friday\n\nDecember 22: Thursday\n\nDecember 21: Wednesday\n\nDecember 20: Tuesday\n\nYes, that's 20 days back. So December 20 is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Is 2014 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2014 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2014. First, divide 2014 by 4. Let me do the division: 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2014 minus 2000 is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3.5. So 2014 divided by 4 is 503.5. That means 2014 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that calculation. Let me add 4 to 2012, which is a leap year. 2012 + 4 is 2016, so 2014 is two years after 2012, so it's not a leap year. Yeah, that makes sense. Since 2014 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [74, "In a year where Sunday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 11. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the weekday of April 11th in a year where January 1st is a Sunday. So I need to figure out what day of the week April 11th falls on, given that January 1st is a Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of days between January 1st and April 11th. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, maybe I need to assume it's not a leap year unless stated otherwise. So February has 28 days. March has 31 days. Then April 11th is 11 days into April.\n\nSo adding up the days: January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since we start counting from day 0). Then February is 28 days, March is 31 days, and then April 11th is 11 days. So total days from January 1st to April 11th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 11 is 100 days. Wait, but wait, that's from January 1st to April 11th inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So the number of days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 30 + 28 = 58. March has 31 days, so March 31st is day 58 + 31 = 89. Then April 1st is day 90, April 11th is day 90 + 10 = 100. So April 11th is 100 days after January 1st.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Sunday, I need to find what day of the week 100 days later is. Since each week has 7 days, I can divide 100 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is.\n\nSo 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 2 days (since 14*7=98, 100-98=2). So 100 days later is 2 days after Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 days is Tuesday. Therefore, April 11th should be a Tuesday.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the day count. Maybe I made a mistake in adding the days. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. From January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to day 58 (February 28th). March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to day 58 + 31 = 89 (March 31st). Then April 1st is day 90, April 2nd is 91, ..., April 11th is day 90 + 10 = 100. So that's correct. 100 days total.\n\nSo 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks (98 days) and 2 days. So 2 days after Sunday is Tuesday. Therefore, April 11th is a Tuesday. I think that's right. Let me check with another method. For example, if January 1st is Sunday, then January 8th is also Sunday (7 days later). Then January 15th, 22nd, 29th are Sundays. Then February 5th is the next Sunday (since January 29th + 7 days is February 5th). Then February 12th, 19th, 26th are Sundays. March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th, and April 2nd are Sundays. So April 2nd is a Sunday. Then April 9th is Sunday (adding 7 days), so April 11th is two days after that, which would be Tuesday. That matches the previous calculation. So yes, April 11th is a Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Between Tuesday, January 25, 2022 and Tuesday, March 29, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, January 25, 2022, and Tuesday, March 29, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me check the dates. January 25 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think January 25, 2022 was a Tuesday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can count the days or use a calendar. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down month by month. From January 25 to January 31, then February, then March 1 to March 29.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days between the two dates. Let's start with January 25, 2022, and go to March 29, 2022.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 25 to January 31 is 31 - 25 + 1 = 7 days. Wait, because inclusive. So January 25 is day 1, January 26 is day 2, ..., January 31 is day 7. So that's 7 days in January.\n\nThen February 2022 has 28 days because 2022 is not a leap year. So February has 28 days.\n\nMarch 1 to March 29 is 29 days (including both ends). Wait, March 1 is day 1, March 29 is day 29. So that's 29 days.\n\nSo total days from January 25 to March 29 inclusive is 7 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 29 (Mar) = 64 days.\n\nWait, let me check that again. January 25 to January 31 is 7 days. Then February is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. 7 + 28 is 35, plus 29 is 64. So total 64 days.\n\nNow, out of these 64 days, how many are weekends? Let's find the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nSince January 25 is a Tuesday, let's figure out the days of the week for each month.\n\nStarting with January 25 (Tuesday). Let's list the days:\n\nJanuary 25: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 26: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 27: Thursday\n\nJanuary 28: Friday\n\nJanuary 29: Saturday\n\nJanuary 30: Sunday\n\nJanuary 31: Monday\n\nSo January 25 to January 31 includes one Saturday (29th) and one Sunday (30th). So in January, there are 2 weekend days.\n\nThen February 2022. Let's check what day of the week February 1, 2022 was. Since January 31 is a Monday, February 1 is a Tuesday. Wait, January 31 is Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 2 is Wednesday, and so on. So February has 28 days. Let's see how many weekends in February.\n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend in February would be February 4 (Saturday) and February 5 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is February 11, 12; 18, 19; 25, 26. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in February.\n\nSince February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks. So there are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. So 8 weekend days in February.\n\nThen March 2022. March 1 is a Tuesday (since February 28 is a Monday, because February has 28 days, which is 4 weeks. So February 28 is a Monday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. So March 1 is Tuesday. Let's check the days in March.\n\nMarch 1: Tuesday\n\nMarch 2: Wednesday\n\nMarch 3: Thursday\n\nMarch 4: Friday\n\nMarch 5: Saturday\n\nMarch 6: Sunday\n\nMarch 7: Monday\n\nMarch 8: Tuesday\n\n... and so on. March 29 is the end date. Let's check what day March 29 is. Since March 1 is Tuesday, March 8 is Tuesday, March 15 is Tuesday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 29 is Tuesday. So March 29 is a Tuesday. So the weekends in March would be March 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 8 weekend days in March. Wait, but March has 29 days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, March 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend is March 5 (Sat) and 6 (Sun). Then next is 12,13; 19,20; 26,27. That's 4 weekends, 8 days. Then March 29 is Tuesday, so the next weekend would be March 30 and 31, but March 29 is the end date. So in March, there are 8 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekends: January (2) + February (8) + March (8) = 18 weekend days.\n\nTotal days: 64. So business days would be 64 - 18 = 46.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let's see. 64 days total. 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. Because 9*7=63, so 64 is 9 weeks and 1 day. So in 9 weeks, there are 9*5=45 business days. Then the remaining 1 day is the 64th day. Since the first day is Tuesday (Jan 25), the 64th day would be Tuesday again (since 63 days is 9 weeks, so day 63 is Tuesday, day 64 is Wednesday). Wait, but that's conflicting with earlier calculation. Wait, maybe I need to check the actual days.\n\nWait, if January 25 is Tuesday, then adding 63 days (9 weeks) would be Tuesday again. So day 63 is Tuesday, day 64 is Wednesday. So the 64th day is Wednesday. So in that case, the total business days would be 9 weeks (45 days) plus the remaining 1 day (Wednesday) which is a business day. So total 46 days. Which matches the previous calculation. So that's 46 business days.\n\nBut wait, earlier I had 64 total days minus 18 weekend days equals 46. So that's consistent. So the answer should be 46.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check each month again.\n\nJanuary: 2 weekend days (29th and 30th). Correct.\n\nFebruary: 28 days, 4 weeks. 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. 8 days. Correct.\n\nMarch: 29 days. March 1 is Tuesday. So the weekends are 5,6; 12,13; 19,20; 26,27. That's 4 weekends, 8 days. So March has 8 weekend days. So total 2+8+8=18. 64-18=46. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's check the actual dates.\n\nBut since I don't have a calendar here, I need to rely on calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can check the number of days in each month again.\n\nJanuary 25 to January 31: 7 days. Correct.\n\nFebruary: 28 days. Correct.\n\nMarch 1 to March 29: 29 days. Correct. 7+28+29=64. Correct.\n\nSo total days 64. Weekends 18. Business days 46.

I need to figure out which Saturday that is. First, I should check what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I might need to recall or calculate that. Alternatively, maybe I can look up the calendar for December 2022. But since I can't actually look it up, I need to figure it out step by step.\n\nLet me think. I know that December has 31 days. The last Saturday would be the 31st if that's a Saturday, otherwise the 24th or 25th, depending on the month's start. Wait, but how do I determine the day of the week for December 1, 2022?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use known dates. For example, I remember that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think. If I can figure out the day of the week for a known date in December 2022, then I can work from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 2022 had a certain number of days. Let me think. December has 31 days. So the last Saturday would be the 31st if that's a Saturday. But how do I check that?\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday.

Then each week after that. So the next Saturday would be the 10th, 17th, 24th, and then the 31st. Wait, if December 3 is a Saturday, then adding 7 days would be the 10th, then 17th, 24th, and 31st. So the last Saturday would be the 31st. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, but if December 1 is a Thursday, then December 3 is a Saturday. Then December 31 would be 28 days later. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so December 31 would be a Saturday as well. Because 3 + 28 = 31. So that would mean December 31, 2022, was a Saturday. Therefore, the last Saturday in December 2022 is the 31st. So the answer should be 31.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that December 1, 2022, was indeed a Thursday. Let me think again. Let's check another way. For example, I know that December 21, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 21 is Wednesday. Let's count backwards. December 21 is Wednesday. Then December 14 is Wednesday, December 7 is Wednesday, December 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought.

Then December 31, 2022, would be the day before, which would be Saturday. Because 2022 is not a leap year, so December 31, 2022, is the day before January 1, 2023. Therefore, December 31, 2022, was a Saturday. Therefore, the last Saturday in December is the 31st. So that would be the answer.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to go back to 2022. Let me check. Wait, maybe I should use a reference date that I know. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, no, maybe I should check another date. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I can figure out how many days are between November 15, 2022 and January 1, 2023, I can count backward.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to use a known date in 2022. Let me think. For example, I know that November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. If I can remember that November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then adding 14 days (which is two weeks) would bring me to November 15, 2022. So November 15 would be a Tuesday as well. But wait, that seems too easy. Maybe I should verify this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Let me think. If November 15 is 16 days before December 1. Wait, November has 30 days, so from November 15 to November 30 is 15 days. Then December 1 is 1 day after November 30. So November 15 plus 16 days is December 1. If December 1 is a Thursday, then November 15 would be 16 days before that. Since 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So subtracting 2 days from Thursday would be Tuesday. So November 15, 2022 would be a Tuesday. That seems to match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check the actual calendar. Wait, I can't look it up, but I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So January 1, 2023 is Sunday. Then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then November 15, 2022 is 47 days before December 31, 2022. Wait, let me calculate that. From November 15 to November 30 is 15 days. Then December 1 to December 31 is 31 days. So total 15 + 31 = 46 days. So 46 days before December 31, 2022 is November 15. So 46 days before Saturday. Let's divide 46 by 7. 7*6=42, so 46-42=4. So 4 days before Saturday is Tuesday. Because Saturday minus 1 day is Friday, minus 2 is Thursday, minus 3 is Wednesday, minus 4 is Tuesday. So that also gives Tuesday.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Thursday is the 1st. The second Thursday would be the 8th, and the third would be the 15th. But wait, maybe I should check again. Let me think. If December 1 is a Thursday, then adding 7 days would be the next Thursday, so 8th, then 15th, 22nd, and 29th. So the third Thursday would be the 15th. But wait, is that right? Let me count again. First Thursday is 1st, second is 8th, third is 15th. Yes, that seems correct. But I should make sure that December 2022 actually has that many Thursdays. December has 31 days, so there are four Thursdays in December. The fourth would be the 22nd, then 29th. Wait, no, if the first is 1st, then 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th. So five Thursdays? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, December has 31 days. Let me check the dates again. If December 1 is a Thursday, then the Thursdays would be 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's five Thursdays. But the question is asking for the third one. So the third would be the 15th. So the answer should be 15. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me check an actual calendar or a way to confirm. Alternatively, I can use another method. Let me think. For example, if I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday, then the third Thursday would be 1 + 7*2 = 15. So that's the 15th. But maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the days of the week for December 2022. For example, if I know that December 2022 started on a Thursday, then the first week would have the 1st as Thursday, 2nd Friday, 3rd Saturday, 4th Sunday, 5th Monday, 6th Tuesday, 7th Wednesday. Then the next week starts on the 8th, which is Thursday again. So the third Thursday would be the 15th. So yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the third Thursday in December 2022 is the 15th.

The question is asking what day of the week it was 58 days ago, given that today is Friday, March 11, 2022. I need to figure out the day by counting backward 58 days from today.\n\nFirst, I know that weeks have 7 days, so I can divide 58 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days that is. Let me do the division: 58 divided by 7. 7 times 8 is 56, so that leaves a remainder of 2. So 58 days ago is the same as 8 weeks and 2 days ago. Since 8 weeks is exactly 56 days, subtracting that from 58 leaves 2 days. \n\nNow, if today is Friday, March 11, 2022, then 8 weeks ago would also be a Friday. Because each week cycles every 7 days. So subtracting 8 weeks (56 days) from March 11, 2022, would take me back to March 11, 2021, which was also a Friday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should verify the actual date. Wait, but the problem says today is March 11, 2022, so 56 days ago would be March 11 minus 56 days. Let me check that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the days step by step. But since 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 2 days, then going back 58 days is the same as going back 8 weeks (which is 56 days) and then 2 more days. So if today is Friday, then 56 days ago was also a Friday. Then subtracting 2 more days would be Thursday (56 days ago) and then Wednesday (57 days ago), and 58 days ago would be Tuesday? Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIf today is Friday, then one day ago was Thursday, two days ago was Wednesday, three days ago was Tuesday, and so on. So if I go back 2 days from Friday, that would be Wednesday. Wait, no. Wait, if today is Friday, then 1 day ago was Thursday, 2 days ago was Wednesday. So 58 days ago is 8 weeks (56 days) plus 2 days. So 56 days ago is Friday, then 57 days ago is Thursday, 58 days ago is Wednesday. Wait, that seems right. So the answer should be Wednesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let me try to count the days. Let's take March 11, 2022, as the starting point. Let's count backward 58 days. But maybe it's easier to use modular arithmetic. Since 58 divided by 7 is 8 with a remainder of 2. So 58 days ago is equivalent to 2 days before Friday. So Friday minus 2 days is Wednesday. So that would be Wednesday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual calendar. But since I don't have a calendar here, I need to rely on calculations. Let me confirm again. If today is Friday, then 7 days ago was also Friday. So 14 days ago was Friday, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56 days ago. So 56 days ago was Friday. Then 57 days ago is Thursday, 58 days ago is Wednesday. So the answer should be Wednesday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me check 7 times 8 is 56, so 58 minus 56 is 2. So yes, remainder 2. So 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday. So Friday minus 2 days is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is Wednesday.", "Wednesday"], [74, "Name the day of the week for 10/16/2022.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If I recall, 2022 started on a Sunday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Let me check. Wait, I think 2022 started on a Monday. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a reference date that I know. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's what I need to find out. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think of another way. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if I know the day of the week for a certain date in the same month, I can count forward or backward. For example, if I know that October 16, 2022 is a certain day, but I need to find it. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is the same as October 16, 2023, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, because 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2022 started on a Saturday, then 2023 would start on a Sunday. Wait, that makes sense. So if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. \n\nNow, October 16, 2022. Let's count the days from January 1, 2022 (Saturday) to October 16, 2022. Let's break it down month by month. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and October 16. \n\nSo let's calculate the total days from January 1 to October 16. \n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober: 16\n\nAdding those up: 31 + 28 = 59; 59 +31=90; 90+30=120; 120+31=151; 151+30=181; 181+31=212; 212+31=243; 243+30=273; 273 +16=289 days. \n\nSo from January 1, 2022 (Saturday) to October 16, 2022 is 289 days. Now, since 289 divided by 7 is 41 weeks and 2 days. So 41 weeks is 287 days, so 289 days is 41 weeks and 2 days. Therefore, October 16, 2022 would be 2 days after Saturday. Saturday + 1 day is Sunday, +2 days is Monday. Wait, but that would mean October 16, 2022 is a Monday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let me add the days again step by step. \n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (total 90)\nApril: 30 (total 120)\nMay: 31 (total 151)\nJune: 30 (total 181)\nJuly: 31 (total 212)\nAugust: 31 (total 243)\nSeptember: 30 (total 273)\nOctober: 16 (total 289). Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo 289 days. 289 divided by 7 is 41.2857... So 41 weeks is 287 days, so 289 - 287 = 2 days. So adding 2 days to Saturday. Saturday + 1 day is Sunday, +2 is Monday. So October 16, 2022 would be a Monday. \n\nBut wait, I think I might be wrong here. Because if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then adding 289 days would be 289 days later. But maybe I should check another way. For example, if I know that October 16, 2022 is a certain day. Alternatively, maybe I can check a calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my calculations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another reference. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me check again. \n\nWait, if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Because 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2022 started on a Saturday, then 2023 would start on a Sunday. That seems correct. \n\nSo if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 289 days would be October 16, 2022. So 289 days later. 289 divided by 7 is 41 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Therefore, October 16, 2022 is a Monday. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 is the same as October 16, 2023, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can check a known date in October 2022. For example, October 16, 2022. Wait, I think I remember that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. But according to my calculation, it's a Monday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let me count the days from January 1 to October 16. \n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober: 16\n\nAdding them up:\n\n31 + 28 = 59\n59 + 31 = 90\n90 + 30 = 120\n120 + 31 = 151\n151 + 30 = 181\n181 + 31 = 212\n212 + 31 = 243\n243 + 30 = 273\n273 + 16 = 289. \n\nYes, that's correct. So 289 days. \n\nBut if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 289 days would be 41 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. But if I think that October 16, 2022 is a Sunday, then that would be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that again. \n\nIf January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then January 1, 2022 would be 365 days before. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2023 starts on Sunday, then 2022 starts on Sunday minus 1 day, which is Saturday. So that's correct. \n\nSo if that's the case, then October 16, 2022 is a Monday. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should check another way. For example, let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 is the same as October 16, 2023. Wait, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 4, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. If October 16 is a Monday, then November 4 would be 18 days later. 18 days is 2 weeks and 4 days. So Monday + 4 days is Friday. That matches. So if November 4, 2022 is a Friday, then that would confirm that October 16 is a Monday. \n\nAlternatively, I can check another date. For example, October 16, 2022. If I know that October 16, 2022 is a Monday, then October 23, 2022 would be a Monday as well. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is the same as October 16, 2023.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous calculation. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let me count the days from January 1 to October 16. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. \n\nFebruary has 28 days. So up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. \n\nMarch has 31 days. So up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90 days. \n\nApril has 30 days. Up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120 days. \n\nMay has 31 days. Up to May 31 is 120 + 31 = 151 days. \n\nJune has 30 days. Up to June 30 is 151 + 30 = 181 days. \n\nJuly has 31 days. Up to July 31 is 181 + 31 = 212 days. \n\nAugust has 31 days. Up to August 31 is 212 + 31 = 243 days. \n\nSeptember has 30 days. Up to September 30 is 243 + 30 = 273 days. \n\nOctober 16 is 273 + 16 = 289 days. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nSo if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 289 days would be 41 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Therefore, October 16, 2022 is a Monday. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should check another way. Let's take a known date in 2022.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use a known date and count the days from there. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I should use another method. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know some specific dates. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. July 4, 2022: if I count the days from there. Let's see, July 4 is a Monday. Then July 11 is also a Monday, and so on. \n\nBut how does that help me with November 28? Let me think. Let's count the number of days between July 4 and November 28. July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September has 30, October has 31, and November 28. So adding those up: 27 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 28 (November) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 28 is 147 days. Wait, but that's from July 4 to November 28 inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if July 4 is day 0, then adding 147 days would take me to November 28. But I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of days between July 4 and November 28. Let me do that again. \n\nJuly 4 to July 31: 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August is 31, September 30, October 31, and November 28. So total days from July 4 to November 28 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 28 = 147 days. But if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 147 days would take me to November 28. Now, since 147 divided by 7 is 21 weeks exactly, which is 147 days. So 21 weeks later would be the same day of the week. Therefore, November 28 would also be a Monday. Wait, but that seems too easy. But maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. \n\nWait, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August is 31, September 30, October 31, and November 28. So 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 28 is 147. Yes, that's correct. So 147 days later. Since 147 divided by 7 is 21, which is exactly 21 weeks. So if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 21 weeks would still be a Monday. Therefore, November 28, 2022 would be a Monday. \n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if July 4, 2022 was actually a Monday. Maybe I should check that. Let me think. I know that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, I think July 4, 2021 was a Sunday. Wait, maybe I need to verify this. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then November 28 would be earlier in the year. Let me count the days from November 28 to December 25. November has 30 days, so from November 28 to November 30 is 2 days. Then December 1 to December 25 is 25 days. So total 2 + 25 = 27 days. So if December 25 is a Sunday, then November 28 would be 27 days before that. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So subtracting 6 days from Sunday would be Monday. Wait, because if you go back 6 days from Sunday: Sunday minus 1 day is Saturday, minus 2 is Friday, minus 3 is Thursday, minus 4 is Wednesday, minus 5 is Tuesday, minus 6 is Monday. So November 28 would be a Monday. That matches the previous calculation. So that seems to confirm that November 28, 2022 was a Monday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. Wait, but I thought that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So that would make sense. So if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make January 1, 2023 a Sunday. That's correct. So if that's the case, then let's count from January 1, 2022 (Saturday) to November 28, 2022. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of days from January 1 to November 28.

So adding those up: \n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\nOctober: 31 (304)\nNovember: 28 (332)\n\nSo from January 1 to November 28 is 332 days. Now, since January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, adding 332 days would take us to November 28. Now, 332 divided by 7 is 47 weeks and 3 days. So 47 weeks is 329 days, and 3 days more. So adding 3 days to Saturday would be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Wait, that would mean November 28 is a Thursday? But that contradicts the previous conclusion of Monday. So there's a problem here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to November 28, 2022. \n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\nOctober: 31 (304)\nNovember: 28 (332)\n\nYes, that's correct. So 332 days. Now, 332 divided by 7 is 47 weeks and 3 days. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 47 weeks (329 days) would still be Saturday. Then adding 3 more days would be Saturday + 1 = Sunday, +2 = Monday, +3 = Tuesday. So November 28 would be a Tuesday? But that contradicts the previous conclusion of Monday. So which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. Wait, I think I might have confused the years. Let me check. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if 2022 is not a leap year, then 2022 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be one day before Sunday, which is Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then November 28 would be 332 days later. 332 divided by 7 is 47 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday would be Tuesday. But earlier, when I used the July 4 method, I thought it was Monday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the July 4 calculation. Let me check that again. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then adding 147 days (which is 21 weeks) would be November 28. But if July 4 is a Monday, then November 28 is also a Monday. But according to the other method, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check an online calendar or use another known date. Wait, I can't access the internet, but maybe I can use another approach. Let's take another known date. For example, I know that November 25, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then November 28 would be two days later, which would be Sunday. But that contradicts both previous answers. Hmm, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let's check that. If December 25 is a Sunday, then November 28 is 27 days earlier. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So subtracting 6 days from Sunday would be Monday. So November 28 would be a Monday. But according to the January 1 method, it's Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between November 28 and December 25. Let me check again. November has 30 days, so from November 28 to November 30 is 2 days. Then December 1 to December 25 is 25 days. So total 2 + 25 = 27 days. That's correct. So if December 25 is Sunday, then November 28 is 27 days before. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So subtracting 6 days from Sunday: Sunday minus 6 days is Monday. So November 28 is Monday. But according to the January 1 method, it's Tuesday. So there's a conflict here. \n\nThis suggests that one of the methods is wrong. Let me check the January 1 method again. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then adding 332 days would be November 28. But 332 days is 47 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. But if December 25 is Sunday, then November 28 is Monday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days from January 1 to November 28. Let me recount. \n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\nOctober: 31 (304)\nNovember: 28 (332)\n\nYes, that's correct. So 332 days. So if January 1 is Saturday, then November 28 is 332 days later. 332 divided by 7 is 47 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. But according to the December 25 method, it's Monday. So there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe the error is in the assumption that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If I know that November 28 is Monday, then December 25 would be 27 days later. 27 days is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. So that would make December 25 a Sunday. But if November 28 is Tuesday, then December 25 would be 27 days later, which is Tuesday + 6 days = Monday. So that would mean December 25 is Monday. But I thought December 25 was Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check another date. For example, I know that December 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 25 would be 24 days later. 24 days is 3 weeks and 3 days. So Thursday + 3 days is Sunday. So December 25 would be Sunday. That matches the previous calculation. So if December 25 is Sunday, then November 28 is Monday. But according to the January 1 method, it's Tuesday. So there's a problem here. \n\nWait, maybe the error is in the January 1 calculation. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Let me check that. 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023 is one day after Saturday, which is Sunday. That's correct. So that part is correct. \n\nNow, if December 1, 2022 is a Thursday, then December 25 is 24 days later. 24 days is 3 weeks and 3 days. So Thursday + 3 days is Sunday. So December 25 is Sunday. That's correct. So November 28 is 27 days before December 25. 27 days is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday minus 6 days is Monday. So November 28 is Monday. \n\nBut according to the January 1 method, November 28 is Tuesday. So why the discrepancy? Where is the mistake here? \n\nWait, maybe the number of days from January 1 to November 28 is not 332. Let me check again. \n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (90)\nApril: 30 (120)\nMay: 31 (151)\nJune: 30 (181)\nJuly: 31 (212)\nAugust: 31 (243)\nSeptember: 30 (273)\nOctober: 31 (304)\nNovember: 28 (332)\n\nYes, that's correct. So 332 days. So if January 1 is Saturday, then November 28 is 332 days later. 332 divided by 7 is 47 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. But according to the other method, it's Monday. So there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe the error is in the assumption that December 1, 2022 is a Thursday. Let me check that. If November 28 is Monday, then December 1 is 3 days later, which would be Thursday. So that's correct. So December 1 is Thursday. Then December 25 is 24 days later, which is Sunday. So that's correct. \n\nBut according to the January 1 method, November 28 is Tuesday. So why is there a discrepancy? \n\nWait, maybe the error is in the calculation of the number of days from January 1 to November 28. Let me check again. \n\nWait, January 1 is day 1. So the number of days from January 1 to November 28 is 332 days. But if January 1 is day 1, then the number of days between January 1 and November 28 is 332 - 1 = 331 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you count from January 1 to November 28 inclusive, it's 332 days. But if you want to calculate the number of days between January 1 and November 28, not including January 1, it's 331 days. But when calculating the day of the week, if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 331 days would be the day of the week for November 28. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, the formula is: if January 1 is day 0, then adding N days would be day N. But if January 1 is day"], [74, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, August 14, 2022 to Sunday, October 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Write the total number.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from August 14, 2022 (Sunday) to October 16, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. August 14 is a Sunday. Let's list the dates week by week.\n\nAugust 14 (Sunday) is the starting point. The next day, August 15 is Monday. Then August 16 is Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday. Then August 20 is Saturday, 21 Sunday. Wait, but August 21 is a Sunday? Wait, let me check that. Wait, August 14 is Sunday. So August 15 is Monday, 16 Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday, 20 Saturday, 21 Sunday. Yes, that's correct. So August 21 is Sunday again.\n\nSo from August 14 to August 21, that's 8 days. But since August 14 is Sunday, and August 21 is Sunday, that's two weeks? Wait, no. Wait, August 14 is day 1 (Sunday), then August 15 is day 2 (Monday), and so on. So from August 14 to August 21 is 8 days. But how many business days are in that period?\n\nFrom August 14 (Sunday) to August 19 (Friday) is 6 days. Then August 20 is Saturday, 21 is Sunday. So in that first week, from August 14 to August 19, there are 5 business days (Monday to Friday). Then August 20 and 21 are weekends. So that's 5 business days in the first week.\n\nThen September comes in. Let's check September. September 1, 2022 is a Thursday. Wait, let me confirm that. Wait, August 14 is Sunday. August 15 is Monday. August 16 is Tuesday. August 17 is Wednesday. August 18 is Thursday. August 19 is Friday. August 20 is Saturday. August 21 is Sunday. August 22 is Monday. So September 1, 2022 is a Thursday. Wait, August 22 is Monday, August 23 Tuesday, 24 Wednesday, 25 Thursday, 26 Friday, 27 Saturday, 28 Sunday, 29 Monday, 30 Tuesday, 31 Wednesday. So September 1 is Thursday. So September 1 is Thursday. So September has 30 days. Let me check the dates.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the number of weeks between the dates. Let's see. From August 14 (Sunday) to October 16 (Sunday). Let's calculate the total days between these dates, then subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe break it down into months. August, September, October.\n\nFirst, August: from August 14 to August 31. Let's count the days. August 14 is Sunday. August 15 is Monday. August 16 is Tuesday. August 17 is Wednesday. August 18 is Thursday. August 19 is Friday. August 20 is Saturday. August 21 is Sunday. August 22 is Monday. August 23 is Tuesday. August 24 is Wednesday. August 25 is Thursday. August 26 is Friday. August 27 is Saturday. August 28 is Sunday. August 29 is Monday. August 30 is Tuesday. August 31 is Wednesday. So August 14 to August 31 is 18 days (since August 14 is day 1, August 31 is day 18). Wait, August 14 to August 15 is 2 days. So from August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. Let me check: August has 31 days. From August 14 to August 31 is 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days. Yes. So 18 days in August.\n\nNow, September has 30 days. Then October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So total days from August 14 to October 16 inclusive is 18 (August) + 30 (September) + 16 (October) = 64 days. Wait, but wait, August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. Then September is 30 days.

I need to count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022, and find out what day of the week that falls on. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can divide 70 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that: 70 divided by 7 is 10. So 70 days is exactly 10 weeks. Wait, if that's the case, then subtracting 10 weeks from September 2, 2022, should land me on the same day of the week, right? Because a week is 7 days, so subtracting a multiple of 7 days doesn't change the weekday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me confirm the date. September 2, 2022, is a Friday. If I subtract 7 days, that would be August 26, 2022, which is also a Friday. Then subtract another 7 days, August 19, 2022, also Friday. So every 7 days, the weekday remains the same. Therefore, subtracting 70 days (which is 10 weeks) would still be a Friday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the dates? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. But since we're dealing with September, which is after February, leap years don't affect this. So the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's try that. Starting from September 2, 2022, going back 70 days. Let's break it down into months. \n\nSeptember has 30 days. So September 2 minus 70 days. Let's subtract 30 days first. September 2 minus 30 days is August 3, 2022. Then subtract another 30 days: July 3, 2022. Then subtract another 10 days: June 23, 2022. Wait, but that's 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. Wait, but that would be going back 30 days to August 3, then another 30 days to July 3, then another 10 days to June 23. Wait, but that's 70 days total. But is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe I should check the dates. Let me think. September 2 minus 30 days is August 3. Then August has 31 days, so subtracting another 30 days would be July 3 (since August 3 minus 30 days is July 3). Then subtract 10 more days: July 3 minus 10 days is June 23. So the total is 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. So the date would be June 23, 2022. Now, what day of the week is June 23, 2022?\n\nBut wait, if I subtract 70 days from September 2, 2022, which is a Friday, then if 70 days is exactly 10 weeks, then June 23 should also be a Friday. But maybe I should check the actual date. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's check the day of the week for June 23, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to calculate it manually. Let's try to count the days step by step. Let's start from September 2, 2022 (Friday). Let's count backward 70 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's start from September 2, 2022. Let's subtract 70 days. Let's break it down:\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So September 2 minus 29 days would be August 3 (since September 2 minus 1 day is August 31, minus 28 days is August 3). Wait, maybe that's confusing. Let me think again. If I subtract 30 days from September 2, that would be August 3. Then subtract another 30 days (total 60 days) would be July 3. Then subtract 10 more days (total 70 days) would be June 23. So June 23, 2022. Now, what day is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for June 23, 2022. Let's think. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that June 23, 2022, was a Thursday? Wait, no. Wait, September 2, 2022, is a Friday. Let me check the days between June 23 and September 2. Let's count the days between June 23 and September 2. June has 30 days, so from June 23 to June 30 is 7 days. Then July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September 2 is 2 days. So total days from June 23 to September 2 is 7 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 71 days. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, June 23 to June 30 is 7 days (including June 23?), no. Wait, if I start on June 23, then June 24 is +1 day, so June 23 to June 30 is 7 days. Then July has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then August has 31 days, adding 31 days. Then September 1 is 31 + 31 = 62 days after June 23. Then September 2 is 63 days after June 23. Wait, but that would mean that June 23 is 63 days before September 2. But I thought earlier that 70 days back would be June 23. So there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that my previous calculation was wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days between June 23 and September 2. Let me do it again. Let's count the days from June 23 to September 2. June has 30 days. So from June 23 to June 30 is 30 - 23 = 7 days. Then July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September 2 is 2 days. So total days from June 23 to September 2 is 7 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 2 (September) = 7 + 31 is 38, plus 31 is 69, plus 2 is 71 days. Wait, that's 71 days. So that means that June 23 is 71 days before September 2. Therefore, if I subtract 70 days from September 2, it would be one day before June 23, which is June 22. So that's where I made a mistake earlier. So my initial calculation of subtracting 30 days (August 3), then another 30 days (July 3), then 10 days (June 23) was wrong. Because that would be 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days, but the actual days between June 23 and September 2 is 71 days. Therefore, subtracting 70 days from September 2 would be June 22, not June 23. So that's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nSo now I need to correct that. Let me recalculate. If June 23 is 71 days before September 2, then subtracting 70 days would be June 22. So June 22, 2022. Now, what day of the week is June 22, 2022?\n\nBut how do I find that? Well, since September 2 is a Friday, and June 22 is 70 days before that. Let me think. If I can find the day of the week for June 22, 2022, then that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 70 days is 10 weeks, so if September 2 is a Friday, then June 22 should also be a Friday. But wait, that contradicts the previous calculation where June 22 is 70 days before September 2. But if 70 days is exactly 10 weeks, then the day of the week should be the same. But earlier, when I tried to count the days between June 23 and September 2, I found 71 days, which suggests that June 22 is 70 days before September 2. So that would mean that June 22 is a Friday. But why did the day count between June 23 and September 2 come out to 71 days? Let me check again.\n\nLet me count the days from June 23 to September 2. June 23 to June 30 is 7 days (June 23 is day 0, June 24 is +1, ..., June 30 is +7). Then July has 31 days, so adding 31 days. August has 31 days, adding 31 days. Then September 1 is 31 + 31 = 62 days after June 23. September 2 is 63 days after June 23. So that's 63 days. Wait, that's 63 days from June 23 to September 2. So that would mean that June 23 is 63 days before September 2. Therefore, subtracting 63 days from September 2 would be June 23. Then subtracting 7 more days (63 +7=70) would be June 16. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need a better way to calculate the number of days between two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's use the fact that each month has a certain number of days and count backward step by step. Let's start from September 2, 2022, and subtract 70 days.\n\nFirst, subtract 30 days to get to August 3, 2022. Then subtract another 30 days to get to July 3, 2022. Then subtract 10 more days to get to June 23, 2022. Wait, but earlier calculation said that June 23 is 63 days before September 2. So that would mean that subtracting 70 days would be 63 +7 = 70 days. So that would be June 23 minus 7 days, which is June 16. Wait, this is conflicting. I think I need to find a better way to calculate the exact date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 70 days is 10 weeks. So if September 2 is a Friday, then subtracting 10 weeks (70 days) would be the same day of the week. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But why did the previous calculation suggest that June 22 is 70 days before September 2? Maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me check with another method.\n\nLet me check the number of days between June 22 and September 2. June has 30 days, so from June 22 to June 30 is 8 days (June 22 is day 0, June 23 is +1, ..., June 30 is +8). Then July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September 2 is 2 days. So total days from June 22 to September 2 is 8 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 72 days. Wait, that's 72 days. So that would mean that June 22 is 72 days before September 2. Therefore, subtracting 70 days from September 2 would be June 22 minus 2 days, which is June 20. Hmm, this is getting more confusing. I think I need to find a systematic way to calculate the number of days between two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 70 days is 10 weeks. So if September 2 is a Friday, then subtracting 70 days would still be a Friday. Therefore, the answer is Friday. But why does the day count not match? Maybe my day count is wrong. Let me check with a different approach. Let's use the fact that each month has a certain number of days and count backward.\n\nStarting from September 2, 2022:\n\nSubtract 1 day: August 31 (2022)\nSubtract 2 days: August 30\n...\nSubtract 30 days: August 3 (since September 2 minus 30 days is August 3)\nSubtract another 30 days: July 3 (August 3 minus 30 days is July 3)\nSubtract another 10 days: June 23 (July 3 minus 10 days is June 23)\nSo that's 30 + 30 + 10 = 70 days. So June 23 is 70 days before September 2. But earlier, when I counted the days between June 23 and September 2, I thought it was 63 days. That must be where the mistake was. Let me check again.\n\nJune 23 to June 30: 7 days (June 23 is day 0, June 24 is +1, ..., June 30 is +7)\nJuly has 31 days, so adding 31 days (July 1 to July 31)\nAugust has 31 days, adding 31 days (August 1 to August 31)\nSeptember 1 is 7 + 31 + 31 = 69 days after June 23. September 2 is 70 days after June 23. So that means June 23 is 70 days before September 2. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct. So June 23 is 70 days before September 2. Therefore, if September 2 is a Friday, then June 23 is also a Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday.\n\nBut why did I get confused earlier when I thought the days between June 23 and September 2 was 63 days? Because I must have made a mistake in that calculation. Let me check again. If June 23 is day 0, then June 24 is +1, ..., June 30 is +7. July has 31 days, so July 31 is +31 days. August has 31 days, so August 31 is +31 + 31 = 62 days. September 1 is +63 days, September 2 is +64 days. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 70 days is 10 weeks. Since each week has 7 days, subtracting 70 days is the same as subtracting 10 weeks. Therefore, the day of the week remains the same. Therefore, if September 2 is a Friday, then 70 days before that is also a Friday. Therefore, the answer is Friday.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no leap years or other factors affecting the date. Since 2022 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. But since we're dealing with September, which is after February, the number of days in each month is standard. Therefore, the calculation should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Friday.", "Friday"], [74, "In a year where Saturday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 27. Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the weekday of March 27 in a year where January 1st is a Saturday. Hmm, I need to figure out what day of the week March 27 falls on.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 27th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year unless stated otherwise. So February has 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to March 27th would be 31 (January) - 1 (since we start on day 0) + 28 (February) + 27 (March). Wait, no. Wait, January 1st is day 0. So January 1st is Saturday. Then January 2nd is day 1, which is Sunday. So to get to March 27th, I need to count the number of days from January 1st to March 27th, inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then the next day is day 1. So the number of days between January 1st and March 27th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 27? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 30 (remaining days in January) + 28 (February) + 27 (March) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 27 is 85 days. Wait, but that would be 85 days after January 1st. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then day 1 is January 2nd. So March 27th is 85 days after January 1st. Wait, but maybe I should check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's see:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st (Saturday) to January 31st is 30 days later. So January 31st is 30 days after Saturday. Let's calculate that. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 30 days later would be 4 weeks (which is 28 days) plus 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. So January 31st is a Monday.\n\nThen February has 28 days. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28th would be the same day as January 31st, which is Monday. So February 28th is Monday. Then March 1st is Tuesday. Then March 27th is 26 days after March 1st. Wait, March 1st is Tuesday. So adding 26 days to March 1st. Let's calculate 26 divided by 7. 26 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 5 days. So 3 weeks later is Tuesday again, plus 5 days. Tuesday + 5 days is Sunday. Wait, but that would make March 27th a Sunday? But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. If March 1st is Tuesday, then March 8th is Tuesday, March 15th is Tuesday, March 22nd is Tuesday. Then March 29th is Tuesday. So March 27th is two days before March 29th, which would be Sunday. So that's Sunday. But wait, that seems conflicting with the previous calculation where I thought 85 days after January 1st. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the total days from January 1st to March 27th. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days. So total days from January 1st to March 27th is 31 + 28 + 27 = 86 days. Wait, but that's including both start and end dates? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 31st is day 31. Then February 28th is day 31 + 28 = 59. Then March 27th is day 59 + 27 = 86. So March 27th is day 86. But if January 1st is Saturday, then day 1 is Saturday. So day 86 is what day of the week?\n\nTo find the weekday, we can calculate 86 - 1 = 85 days after Saturday. Because day 1 is Saturday, so day 86 is 85 days later. 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (84 days) and 1 day. So 84 days later is Saturday again, plus 1 day is Sunday. So March 27th is Sunday. So that matches the previous calculation. So the answer should be Sunday.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I thought of March 1st as Tuesday, and March 27th as Sunday, that also gives Sunday. So both methods agree. So the answer is Sunday. Therefore, the weekday of March 27 is Sunday.", "Sunday"], [74, "On which weekday did October 8, 2022 fall?

Wait, is that right? Let me check. Hmm, maybe I should count the days from a known date. Let's see, if October 1 is a Saturday, then October 8 would be 7 days later, which would also be a Saturday. But wait, that can't be right because if October 1 is Saturday, then adding 7 days would be the same day of the week. So October 8 would also be a Saturday? But I think I might be mixing up the dates. Wait, maybe I should verify this another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a known reference. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me count backwards. If January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then November 30, 2022 would be a Thursday. Wait, that might not be helpful. Maybe I should use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 8, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think of some other dates. For example, I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If I check an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then October 2 is Sunday, October 3 is Monday, October 4 is Tuesday, October 5 is Wednesday, October 6 is Thursday, October 7 is Friday, and October 8 is Saturday. So that would make October 8, 2022 a Saturday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. For example, if I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then adding 7 days would be the same day. So October 8 would be the same as October 1, which is Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday. But I need to make sure that my initial assumption about October 1, 2022 being a Saturday is correct. Let me think again. If I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 4, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if November 4 is Friday, then October 31 would be a Monday. Then October 31 is Monday, so October 30 is Sunday, October 29 is Saturday, October 28 is Friday, October 27 is Thursday, October 26 is Wednesday, October 25 is Tuesday, October 24 is Monday, October 23 is Sunday, October 22 is Saturday, October 21 is Friday, October 20 is Thursday, October 19 is Wednesday, October 18 is Tuesday, October 17 is Monday, October 16 is Sunday, October 15 is Saturday, October 14 is Friday, October 13 is Thursday, October 12 is Wednesday, October 11 is Tuesday, October 10 is Monday, October 9 is Sunday, October 8 is Saturday.

Reply with the numerical value.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between February 1, 2022 (Tuesday) and April 20, 2022 (Wednesday), inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the dates. February 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. April 20, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let me check if that's correct. Wait, I can use a calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me recall that 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. \n\nSo from February 1 to April 20. Let's break it down:\n\nFebruary: From February 1 to February 28. That's 28 days. But since we start on February 1 (Tuesday), the days in February would be 28 days. But wait, if we include both start and end dates, then the total days would be (April 20 - February 1) + 1. But maybe I should calculate each month's days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. Let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days from February 1 to April 20, inclusive. Let's calculate:\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March has 31 days, and April 20 is 20 days. So total days would be 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 20 (Apr) = 79 days. Wait, but that's if we include all days from Feb 1 to Apr 20. Wait, no. Wait, if you start on Feb 1 and end on Apr 20, the total days would be (28 - 1 + 1) for February (since Feb 1 is included), then March has 31 days, and April 20 is 20 days. Wait, no. Wait, the formula for the number of days between two dates inclusive is (end date - start date) + 1. But to calculate that, I need to know the exact dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down:\n\nFrom February 1 to February 28: 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 28 + 31 = 59 days. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days from Feb 1 to Apr 20 is 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. Wait, but that would be 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 20 (Apr) = 79 days. But if you start on Feb 1 and end on Apr 20, that's 79 days. But wait, if you have 28 days in February, then March is 31, and April 20 is 20. So total days is 28 + 31 + 20 = 79. But that's correct. So total days is 79.\n\nNow, out of these 79 days, how many are weekdays? Since the start date is Tuesday, and the end date is Wednesday. Let's check the days of the week for each month.\n\nFirst, February 1 is a Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday, February 2 is Wednesday, and so on. Let's count the number of weekdays in each month.\n\nFebruary: From Feb 1 (Tuesday) to Feb 28 (which is a Monday, since 28 days later. Let's check: 28 days is 4 weeks, so 28 days later would be the same day of the week. So if Feb 1 is Tuesday, then Feb 28 is also Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, 28 days is exactly 4 weeks. So if Feb 1 is Tuesday, then Feb 28 is also Tuesday. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, 28 days is 4 weeks. So if you start on Tuesday, adding 7 days is the same day. So 28 days later is the same day. So Feb 28 would be a Tuesday. But that would mean that February 28 is a Tuesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Wait, but that would mean that March 1 is a Wednesday. Let me check that again. If Feb 1 is Tuesday, then Feb 8 is Tuesday, Feb 15 is Tuesday, Feb 22 is Tuesday, and Feb 28 is Tuesday. So yes, that's correct. So February has 28 days, ending on Tuesday. So in February, the days are:\n\nTuesday (Feb 1), Wednesday (Feb 2), Thursday (Feb 3), Friday (Feb 4), Saturday (Feb 5), Sunday (Feb 6), Monday (Feb 7), and so on. So in February, the weekdays are the first 5 days of the week, then the next week, etc. Since February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks, so each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekends. So in February, there are 4 weeks * 5 weekdays = 20 weekdays. Wait, but wait, if the first day is Tuesday, then the first week has Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Saturday (5), Sunday (6). So the first week has 5 weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and 2 weekends (Saturday and Sunday). Then the next weeks would be the same. So 4 weeks would have 4*5=20 weekdays. So February has 20 weekdays.\n\nThen March has 31 days. Let's figure out the days of the week for March. Since March 1 is Wednesday (as per the previous calculation, since Feb 28 is Tuesday, March 1 is Wednesday). So March 1 is Wednesday. March has 31 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks would be 28 days, and then 3 days. So the first 28 days of March would be 4 weeks, starting on Wednesday. So the first week of March would be Wednesday (1), Thursday (2), Friday (3), Saturday (4), Sunday (5), then Monday (6), Tuesday (7), etc. Wait, no. Wait, March 1 is Wednesday. So the first week of March would be:\n\nMarch 1 (Wednesday), March 2 (Thursday), March 3 (Friday), March 4 (Saturday), March 5 (Sunday), March 6 (Monday), March 7 (Tuesday), March 8 (Wednesday), etc. So in each week, the weekdays are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday. Wait, no. Wait, the weekdays are Monday to Friday. So in the first week of March, the weekdays are Wednesday (1), Thursday (2), Friday (3), then Saturday (4) and Sunday (5) are weekends. Then Monday (6) and Tuesday (7) are weekdays. So in each week, there are 5 weekdays. So 4 weeks would have 4*5=20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days of March (March 29, 30, 31) would be Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So those are 3 weekdays. So total weekdays in March would be 20 + 3 = 23.\n\nThen April 20. April 1 is a Thursday (since March 31 is a Thursday? Wait, March 31 is the last day of March. Let's check. March 1 is Wednesday. March 28 is Wednesday (since 28 days later). March 29 is Thursday, March 30 is Friday, March 31 is Saturday. Wait, that's not right. Wait, March 1 is Wednesday. March 7 is Tuesday (since 7 days later). Wait, maybe I need to recalculate. Let me think again.\n\nIf March 1 is Wednesday, then March 8 is Wednesday again. So March 1 (Wed), March 2 (Thu), March 3 (Fri), March 4 (Sat), March 5 (Sun), March 6 (Mon), March 7 (Tue), March 8 (Wed). So March 31 is 31 days after March 1. Let's calculate the day of the week for March 31. March 1 is Wednesday. 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 1 + 3 days is Saturday. So March 31 is a Saturday. Therefore, April 1 is a Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if March 31 is Saturday, then April 1 is Sunday. So April 1 is Sunday. Then April 2 is Monday, April 3 is Tuesday, April 4 is Wednesday, April 5 is Thursday, April 6 is Friday, April 7 is Saturday, April 8 is Sunday, etc. So April 20 is 20 days after April 1. Let's check the day of the week for April 20. April 1 is Sunday. 20 days later. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. Wait, but the problem says April 20 is a Wednesday. That contradicts. So there must be a mistake in my calculation. \n\nWait, the problem says that April 20 is a Wednesday. So maybe my previous assumption that March 31 is Saturday is wrong. Let me check again. If March 1 is Wednesday, then March 8 is Wednesday, March 15 is Wednesday, March 22 is Wednesday, March 29 is Wednesday. Then March 30 is Thursday, March 31 is Friday. So March 31 is Friday. Therefore, April 1 is Saturday. Then April 2 is Sunday, April 3 is Monday, April 4 is Tuesday, April 5 is Wednesday, April 6 is Thursday, April 7 is Friday, April 8 is Saturday, etc. So April 1 is Saturday. Then April 20 is 19 days after April 1. 19 days is 2 weeks and 5 days. So April 1 is Saturday, adding 5 days is Thursday. Wait, that's not matching the problem's statement that April 20 is Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my initial assumption that February 1 is Tuesday must be wrong. Wait, but the problem says that February 1 is Tuesday. So maybe I made a mistake in calculating the days of the week for March.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let me check the actual dates. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use the fact that the problem says April 20 is a Wednesday. So if April 20 is Wednesday, then April 1 is a Saturday (since April 20 is 19 days after April 1. 19 days is 2 weeks and 5 days. So if April 20 is Wednesday, then April 1 is Wednesday minus 5 days, which is Saturday. So April 1 is Saturday. Then March 31 is Friday. So March 31 is Friday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Let's check that. March 1 is Wednesday. March 31 is Friday. Let's count the days between March 1 and March 31. March has 31 days. So March 1 is day 1, March 31 is day 31. The difference is 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if March 1 is Wednesday, then March 31 is Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. That's correct. So March 31 is Friday. Therefore, April 1 is Saturday. So that's correct. So April 1 is Saturday. Then April 2 is Sunday, April 3 is Monday, April 4 is Tuesday, April 5 is Wednesday, April 6 is Thursday, April 7 is Friday, April 8 is Saturday, April 9 is Sunday, April 10 is Monday, April 11 is Tuesday, April 12 is Wednesday, April 13 is Thursday, April 14 is Friday, April 15 is Saturday, April 16 is Sunday, April 17 is Monday, April 18 is Tuesday, April 19 is Wednesday, April 20 is Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting with the problem's statement that April 20 is Wednesday. Wait, this is a problem. According to this calculation, April 20 would be Thursday. But the problem says it's Wednesday. So there's a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me check again. If April 1 is Saturday, then:\n\nApril 1: Saturday\n\nApril 2: Sunday\n\nApril 3: Monday\n\nApril 4: Tuesday\n\nApril 5: Wednesday\n\nApril 6: Thursday\n\nApril 7: Friday\n\nApril 8: Saturday\n\nApril 9: Sunday\n\nApril 10: Monday\n\nApril 11: Tuesday\n\nApril 12: Wednesday\n\nApril 13: Thursday\n\nApril 14: Friday\n\nApril 15: Saturday\n\nApril 16: Sunday\n\nApril 17: Monday\n\nApril 18: Tuesday\n\nApril 19: Wednesday\n\nApril 20: Thursday\n\nSo April 20 is Thursday. But the problem says it's Wednesday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Which means that my initial assumption that February 1 is Tuesday is wrong. But the problem says that February 1 is Tuesday. So this suggests that there's an error in my calculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different calendar? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the day count. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's check the actual dates. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use the fact that the problem says April 20 is Wednesday. So if April 20 is Wednesday, then April 1 is Saturday (since 19 days before April 20 is April 1, and 19 days is 2 weeks and 5 days. So Wednesday minus 5 days is Saturday). So April 1 is Saturday. Then March 31 is Friday. So March 31 is Friday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. Let's check that. March 1 is Wednesday. March 31 is Friday. The number of days between March 1 and March 31 is 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Wednesday gives Friday. That's correct. So March 1 is Wednesday. Then February 28 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. So that's correct. Then February 28 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is Wednesday. So that's correct. Then March 31 is Friday. April 1 is Saturday. April 20 is Thursday. But the problem says April 20 is Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different calendar system, or perhaps I made a mistake in the day count. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to adjust my calculations. Let me try again. \n\nIf April 20 is Wednesday, then April 1 is Saturday (as before). Then April 2 is Sunday, April 3 is Monday, April 4 is Tuesday, April 5 is Wednesday, April 6 is Thursday, April 7 is Friday, April 8 is Saturday, April 9 is Sunday, April 10 is Monday, April 11 is Tuesday, April 12 is Wednesday, April 13 is Thursday, April 14 is Friday, April 15 is Saturday, April 16 is Sunday, April 17 is Monday, April 18 is Tuesday, April 19 is Wednesday, April 20 is Thursday. Wait, that's still Thursday. So this suggests that the problem's statement is incorrect, but that's unlikely. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the day count. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I need to check the days again. Let me try to count the days from February 1 to April 20, and see how many weekdays there are. \n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the weekdays in February. Since February has 28 days, which is 4 weeks. So 4 weeks * 5 weekdays = 20 weekdays. \n\nMarch has 31 days. March 1 is Wednesday. So March 1 is Wednesday. Let's count the weekdays in March. March has 31 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks have 20 weekdays. The remaining 3 days are March 29 (Wednesday), March 30 (Thursday), March 31 (Friday). So that's 3 weekdays. So March has 20 + 3 = 23 weekdays. \n\nApril 20 is Wednesday. So April 1 is Saturday. Let's count the weekdays in April up to April 20. April 1 is Saturday. April 2 is Sunday, April 3 is Monday, April 4 is Tuesday, April 5 is Wednesday, April 6 is Thursday, April 7 is Friday, April 8 is Saturday, April 9 is Sunday, April 10 is Monday, April 11 is Tuesday, April 12 is Wednesday, April 13 is Thursday, April 14 is Friday, April 15 is Saturday, April 16 is Sunday, April 17 is Monday, April 18 is Tuesday, April 19 is Wednesday, April 20 is Thursday."], [74, "Name the day of the week for 05/21/2022. Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week May 21, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know the day of the week for. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards to find May 21.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's see. May has 31 days. So May 21 is 21 days into May. Wait, but how does that help me? Maybe I need to find the day of the week for a known date in May 2022 and then count the days from there.\n\nWait, if I can find out what day of the week May 1, 2022 was, then I can add 20 days to get to May 21. Let's try that. Let's say May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then May 8 would be Sunday, May 15 would be Sunday, and May 22 would be Sunday. Wait, but that would mean May 21 would be Saturday. But I'm not sure if May 1 was a Sunday. Maybe I need to check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory or logical steps. Let me think again. I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Saturdays. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. March 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 would be Saturdays. May 7, 14, 21, 28 would be Saturdays. Wait, so May 7, 2022 was a Saturday. Then May 21 would be 14 days later. Since 14 days is two weeks, so May 21 would also be a Saturday. But wait, that would mean May 21 is a Saturday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, but if May 7 is Saturday, then adding 14 days (two weeks) would make May 21 also a Saturday. So that would mean the answer is Saturday. But I need to confirm if May 7, 2022 was indeed a Saturday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's count the days from May 21 to July 4. May has 31 days, so from May 21 to May 31 is 10 days. Then June has 30 days, so from June 1 to June 30 is 30 days. Then July 1 to July 4 is 4 days. So total days from May 21 to July 4 is 10 + 30 + 4 = 44 days. If July 4 is a Monday, then May 21 would be 44 days before that. Since 44 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 2 days. So subtracting 2 days from Monday would be Saturday. So that would mean May 21 is a Saturday. That matches the previous calculation. So that seems to confirm that May 21, 2022 was a Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "Determine if the year 2028 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2028 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2028 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2028 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2028 minus 2000 is 28. 28 divided by 4 is 7. So 500 + 7 is 507. That means 2028 divided by 4 is 507 with no remainder. So that condition is satisfied.\n\nNext, check if 2028 is a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 2028 divided by 100 is 20.28, which is not a whole number. So it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition about being divisible by 400 doesn't apply here.\n\nSince 2028 is divisible by 4 and not a century year, it should be a leap year. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me calculate 4 times 507 again. 500 times 4 is 2000, 7 times 4 is 28. 2000 + 28 is 2028. Yep, that's correct. So no error there.\n\nSo the conclusion is that 2028 is a leap year.", "Yes."], [74, "Count the occurrences of Monday from Sunday, August 14 to Monday, August 15, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Wait, but August 14 is a Monday? Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual dates. Let me think. August 14, 2022. Let me recall that August 15, 2022, was a Monday. Wait, but if August 15 is a Monday, then August 14 would be a Sunday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me think again.

Or perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the period from August 14 to August 15 is two days. If August 14 is a Monday, then August 15 would be a Tuesday. But the question says the end date is Monday, August 15. That would mean that August 14 is a Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe the question has a typo? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the dates.\n\nWait, the question says: \"Count the occurrences of Monday from Sunday, August 14 to Monday, August 15, 2022 (including both start and end dates).\" So the start date is Sunday, August 14, and the end date is Monday, August 15. So the period is from Sunday to Monday, which is two days. So in that case, the Mondays would be August 15. Because August 14 is Sunday, and August 15 is Monday. So only one Monday in that period. But the question says \"from Sunday, August 14 to Monday, August 15\", so including both dates. So the dates are Sunday (start) and Monday (end). So the Mondays in that range would be August 15.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yeah, that seems right. So 2022 started on a Sunday.\n\nNow, I need to find out what day August 27, 2022 was. Let's break it down. Let's count the number of days from January 1, 2022 to August 27, 2022. \n\nFirst, let's count the days in each month. January has 31 days. February 2022 had 28 days because 2022 isn't a leap year. March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, and then August 27. \n\nSo from January 1 to August 27, that's:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 27\n\nAdding those up: 31 + 28 is 59. Then 59 + 31 is 90. 90 + 30 is 120. 120 + 31 is 151. 151 + 30 is 181. 181 + 31 is 212. Then add 27 for August: 212 + 27 = 239 days. So from January 1 to August 27 is 239 days.\n\nNow, since January 1 is a Sunday, adding 239 days to that. But since the week cycles every 7 days, I can divide 239 by 7 and find the remainder. Let's do that. 7 times 34 is 238. So 239 divided by 7 is 34 weeks and 1 day. So that means 239 days later is 34 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Sunday, adding 1 day would be Monday. Wait, but wait, if January 1 is day 0 (Sunday), then day 1 would be January 2, which is Monday. So adding 239 days would be 239 days after Sunday. Since 239 mod 7 is 1, that would be Sunday + 1 day = Monday. So August 27, 2022 would be a Monday?\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let me count the days again step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February is 28, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59. March is 31, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90. April is 30, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120. May is 31, so up to May 31 is 120 + 31 = 151. June is 30, so up to June 30 is 151 + 30 = 181. July is 31, so up to July 31 is 181 + 31 = 212. Then August 27 is 212 + 27 = 239 days. That's correct.\n\nSo 239 days from January 1, 2022 (Sunday). 239 divided by 7 is 34 weeks (238 days) and 1 day. So 238 days later is the same day, Sunday, and then one more day is Monday. So August 27, 2022 would be a Monday. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is also Sunday, and so on. Let me check a specific date. For example, let's check July 4, 2022. Wait, I think July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, but if July 4 is a Monday, then July 4 is 212 days after January 1? Wait, no. Wait, from January 1 to July 4 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 4 (July) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +4=185 days. So 185 days. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So 26 weeks is 182 days, so 185-182=3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. But I thought July 4 was a Monday. Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Wait, maybe I need to check that again.\n\nWait, let me check an actual calendar. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but if July 4 is a Wednesday according to my calculation, but I thought it was a Monday. Maybe I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let's try using another known date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Monday. So that would mean that July 4 is a Monday. So that would mean that my previous calculation was wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nIf July 1 is Friday, then July 1 is day 181 (since from January 1 to July 1 is 31+28+31+30+31+30+1= 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +1=182? Wait, no. Wait, from January 1 to July 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +31=151, +30=181, +1=182 days. So July 1 is day 182. If July 1 is Friday, then day 182 is Friday. So day 182 is Friday. Then day 182 + 3 = day 185 is Monday. So July 4 is Monday. So that's correct. So that means that my previous calculation that July 4 is Wednesday was wrong. So where did I go wrong in the earlier calculation?\n\nEarlier, I said that from January 1 to July 4 is 185 days. So 185 days. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then 26 weeks later is Sunday again, and adding 3 days would be Wednesday. But according to the other method, July 4 is Monday. So that suggests that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is Sunday is wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in that assumption.\n\nSo maybe January 1, 2022 was not a Sunday. Let me check again. Wait, I think I might have confused the years. Let me think. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on a Sunday. But if that's the case, then July 1, 2022 would be 182 days later. 182 divided by 7 is 26 weeks exactly. So July 1 would be Sunday. But that contradicts the previous statement that July 1 was Friday. Wait, this is confusing. There's a contradiction here. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about a known date. For example, I know that August 15, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if that's the case, then August 27 would be 12 days later. 12 days after Monday is 12 mod 7 = 5 days later. So Monday + 5 days is Saturday. But that would mean August 27 is Saturday. But I need to verify this. Alternatively, maybe I should use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if July 4, 2022 is a Monday, then July 4 is day 185. So if July 4 is Monday, then day 185 is Monday. Then day 185 + 239 - 185 = day 239 is August 27. Wait, no. Wait, August 27 is 239 days from January 1. So if day 185 is July 4 (Monday), then day 185 + 54 = day 239. 54 days later. 54 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Monday is Saturday. So August 27 would be Saturday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that August 15, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If August 15 is Monday, then August 27 is 12 days later. 12 days is 1 week and 5 days. So Monday + 5 days is Saturday. So August 27 would be Saturday. But if that's the case, then the answer is Saturday. But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that again. If January 1, 2022 is Sunday, then July 1 is 182 days later. 182 divided by 7 is 26 weeks, so July 1 is Sunday. But earlier I thought July 1 was Friday. That's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I confused the year. Let me think. If January 1, 2021 was a Saturday, then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 starts on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 is Sunday. Then July 1, 2022 is 182 days later. 182 divided by 7 is 26 weeks, so July 1 is Sunday. But if July 1 is Sunday, then July 4 is Wednesday. But earlier I thought July 4 was Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption. Maybe January 1, 2022 is not a Sunday. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the number of days between January 1 and July 1.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the number of days from January 1 to July 1. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so 31 + 28 = 59. March has 31, so 59 + 31 = 90. April has 30, so 90 + 30 = 120. May has 31, so 120 + 31 = 151. June has 30, so 151 + 30 = 181. Then July 1 is 181 + 1 = 182 days. So that's correct. So if January 1 is Sunday, July 1 is Sunday. Then July 4 is 3 days later, which would be Wednesday. But if I think that July 4 is Monday, then that would mean that my initial assumption is wrong. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that August 15, 2022 was a Monday. Let's check that. If August 15 is Monday, then August 27 is 12 days later. 12 days is 1 week and 5 days. So Monday + 5 days is Saturday. So August 27 would be Saturday. But if July 1 is Sunday, then July 4 is Wednesday. Then July 8 is Sunday, July 15 is Sunday, July 22 is Sunday, July 29 is Sunday. Then August 5 is Sunday, August 12 is Sunday, August 19 is Sunday, August 26 is Sunday. So August 26 is Sunday, then August 27 is Monday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. So now I'm really confused.\n\nWait, if August 26 is Sunday, then August 27 is Monday. But earlier I thought August 15 was Monday. Let me check that. If August 15 is Monday, then August 26 is 11 days later. 11 days is 1 week and 4 days. So Monday + 4 days is Friday. But that contradicts the previous statement that August 26 is Sunday. So there's a problem here. Therefore, my assumption that August 15 is Monday must be wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Wait, maybe I should use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that I know that August 27, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but how? Maybe I should use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to rely on calculations. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that again. If July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is 3 days earlier, which would be Friday. So July 1 is Friday. Then July 1 is day 182. So if day 182 is Friday, then day 182 + 239 = day 421. Wait, no, August 27 is day 239. So day 239 is 239 - 182 = 57 days after July 1. 57 days is 8 weeks and 1 day. So July 1 is Friday, adding 8 weeks is Friday again, then +1 day is Saturday. So August 27 would be Saturday. But earlier, when I thought July 1 was Sunday, that led to a contradiction. So this suggests that July 1 is Friday, which would mean that January 1 is not Sunday. Therefore, my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was Sunday is wrong. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if July 1 is Friday, then January 1 is 182 days earlier. 182 days is 26 weeks. So January 1 would be the same day as July 1, which is Friday. But that contradicts the previous calculation that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. So this is confusing. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial assumption. Let me try to find the correct day for January 1, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then 2022 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023 is one day after January 1, 2022. So if January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then January 1, 2022 was Saturday. Wait, that would mean that my initial assumption was wrong. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then July 1, 2022 would be 182 days later. 182 divided by 7 is 26 weeks, so July 1 would be Saturday. Then July 4 would be 3 days later, which is Tuesday. But that contradicts the previous statement that July 4 was Monday. So this is getting more confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's use the fact that I know that August 27, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but how? Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know that August 26, 2022 was a Sunday.

The problem says that January 1st was a Sunday, and I need to find out what day of the week January 21st falls on. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 21st, then determine what day that lands on.\n\nFirst, let me count the days. From January 1st to January 21st, that's 20 days later, right? Because if January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, and so on. So 21 minus 1 is 20 days. Wait, but when you count the days between two dates, sometimes it's inclusive or exclusive. But in this case, since we're starting on January 1st, which is day 1, then January 21st is 20 days after that. So that's 20 days.\n\nNow, each week has 7 days. So I need to divide 20 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 7 times 2 is 14, and 7 times 3 is 21. So 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks with a remainder of 6 days. Because 14 days is two weeks, and 20 minus 14 is 6. So that means 20 days later is 2 weeks and 6 days.\n\nSince January 1st is a Sunday, adding 2 weeks (which is 14 days) would still be a Sunday. Then, adding the remaining 6 days. Let's count those days. Starting from Sunday:\n\n1 day later is Monday (1),\n2 days later is Tuesday (2),\n3 days later is Wednesday (3),\n4 days later is Thursday (4),\n5 days later is Friday (5),\n6 days later is Saturday (6).\n\nSo adding 6 days to Sunday would land on Saturday. Therefore, January 21st should be a Saturday. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count each day step by step. Let's see:\n\nJanuary 1: Sunday\nJanuary 2: Monday\nJanuary 3: Tuesday\nJanuary 4: Wednesday\nJanuary 5: Thursday\nJanuary 6: Friday\nJanuary 7: Saturday\nJanuary 8: Sunday\nJanuary 9: Monday\nJanuary 10: Tuesday\nJanuary 11: Wednesday\nJanuary 12: Thursday\nJanuary 13: Friday\nJanuary 14: Saturday\nJanuary 15: Sunday\nJanuary 16: Monday\nJanuary 17: Tuesday\nJanuary 18: Wednesday\nJanuary 19: Thursday\nJanuary 20: Friday\nJanuary 21: Saturday\n\nYes, that's 21 days. Wait, but January 1 is day 1, so January 21 is day 21. So from day 1 (Sunday) to day 21, that's 20 days later. But when I count each day step by step, I see that January 21 is Saturday. So that matches the earlier calculation. So the answer should be Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "Is 2015 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2015 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2015. First, divide 2015 by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2015 minus 2000 is 15. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75, which means 2015 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should do the division properly. 4 times 503 is 2012, and 2015 minus 2012 is 3. So remainder 3. Therefore, 2015 is not divisible by 4. That means it can't be a leap year, right?

Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 26, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that June 26, 2022, was a significant date because it was the day the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case. But I need to confirm the actual weekday.\n\nFirst, I can try to recall some anchor dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use a known date that I'm certain about. For example, July 4, 2022, was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022, was a Monday, then I can count backwards to June 26.\n\nLet me count the days between June 26 and July 4. June has 30 days, so from June 26 to June 30 is 4 days (26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th\u2014wait, that's 5 days, but if I'm going from June 26 to July 4, that's 8 days later. Wait, June 26 to June 27 is 1 day, June 26 to June 28 is 2 days, and so on. Let me count properly. June 26 is day 0. June 27 is +1, June 28 +2, June 29 +3, June 30 +4. Then July 1 is +5, July 2 +6, July 3 +7, July 4 +8. So July 4 is 8 days after June 26. If July 4 is a Monday, then June 26 would be 8 days before that. Since 7 days is a week, subtracting 7 days from July 4 would bring me back to the same day of the week. So July 4 minus 7 days is June 27, which would also be a Monday. Then June 26 would be one day before that, which is Sunday. Wait, but that would mean June 26, 2022, was a Sunday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another anchor date. For example, I know that June 1, 2022, was a Wednesday. Wait, if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 6 is Monday (since 1 is Wednesday, 2 is Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday). Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday, June 5 is Sunday, June 6 is Monday. So June 6 is Monday. Then June 13 is Monday, June 20 is Monday, June 27 is Monday. So June 27 is Monday. Then June 26 would be Sunday. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, June 26, 2022, was a Sunday. But I should check if June 1, 2022, was indeed a Wednesday. Let me think. I know that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me count the days from January 1 to June 1. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31. So from January 1 to June 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+31=151 days. So 151 days from January 1, 2022, which was a Saturday. Let's divide 151 by 7. 7*21=147, so 151-147=4. So 4 days after Saturday is Wednesday. Therefore, June 1, 2022, was a Wednesday. So that confirms that June 1 is Wednesday.

Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates. \n\nJuly 31, 2022 is a Sunday. Then August 1 is a Monday. Let me list out the days for each month.\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 31 (Sunday) to August 31 (which is a Tuesday, since July 31 is Sunday, August 1 is Monday, August 2 is Tuesday, etc. Wait, August has 31 days. So August 31 would be a Tuesday? Let me check that. Wait, July 31 is Sunday. August 1 is Monday. August 7 is Sunday. So August 7 is Sunday. Then August 14, 21, 28 are Sundays. August 31 is 31-28=3 days after August 28.

Wait, but the end date is October 2, which is a Sunday? Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the actual dates. Let me confirm the days of the week for these dates. \n\nJuly 31, 2022 is a Sunday. August 1 is a Monday. August 2 is Tuesday, August 3 Wednesday, August 4 Thursday, August 5 Friday, August 6 Saturday, August 7 Sunday. So August 7 is Sunday. Then August 14, 21, 28 are Sundays. August 28 is Sunday. Then August 29 is Monday, August 30 Tuesday, August 31 Wednesday. So August 31 is Wednesday. Then September 1 is Thursday. September 2 is Friday, September 3 Saturday, September 4 Sunday. So September 4 is Sunday. Then September 5 is Monday. September 11 is Sunday, September 12 is Monday. September 18 is Sunday, September 19 Monday. September 25 is Sunday, September 26 Monday. September 27 is Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, September 25 is Sunday. Then September 26 is Monday, September 27 Tuesday, September 28 Wednesday, September 29 Thursday, September 30 Friday. So September 30 is Friday. Then October 1 is Saturday, October 2 is Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with the original problem statement. The problem says that October 2 is a Sunday. But according to this, October 2 is Sunday. So that's correct. So the end date is Sunday, October 2.\n\nSo the period is from July 31 (Sunday) to October 2 (Sunday). Now, I need to count the number of weekdays (Monday-Friday) in this period.\n\nLet me break it down month by month.\n\nFirst, July: July 31 is Sunday. So the only day in July is July 31, which is a Sunday. So no weekdays in July except that day, but since it's a weekend, it's excluded. So July contributes 0 weekdays.\n\nThen August: August 1 is Monday. August 2 is Tuesday, August 3 Wednesday, August 4 Thursday, August 5 Friday, August 6 Saturday, August 7 Sunday. So from August 1 to August 7, there are 7 days. The weekdays are Monday to Friday (5 days). Then August 8 is Monday again. So August has 31 days. Let me count the number of weeks in August. August has 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. The 4 weeks would have 4*5=20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days are August 29 (Monday), August 30 (Tuesday), August 31 (Wednesday). So that's 3 weekdays. So total in August is 20 + 3 = 23 weekdays.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, August 1 is Monday. So the first week of August has 7 days: Monday to Sunday. Then the next week is Monday to Sunday again. So 4 weeks would be 28 days. Then the remaining 3 days are August 29, 30, 31. So that's 3 days. So yes, 20 + 3 = 23 weekdays in August.\n\nThen September: September has 30 days. Let's see. September 1 is Thursday. So the first week of September starts on Thursday. Let's count the weekdays. Let's list the days:\n\nSeptember 1: Thursday (weekday)\nSeptember 2: Friday (weekday)\nSeptember 3: Saturday (weekend)\nSeptember 4: Sunday (weekend)\nSeptember 5: Monday (weekday)\nSeptember 6: Tuesday (weekday)\nSeptember 7: Wednesday (weekday)\nSeptember 8: Thursday (weekday)\nSeptember 9: Friday (weekday)\nSeptember 10: Saturday (weekend)\nSeptember 11: Sunday (weekend)\nSeptember 12: Monday (weekday)\n... and so on.\n\nAlternatively, since September has 30 days, which is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks would have 20 weekdays. The remaining 2 days are September 29 (Thursday) and September 30 (Friday). So that's 2 weekdays. So total in September is 20 + 2 = 22 weekdays.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. If September 1 is Thursday, then the first week (Sep 1-7) has 3 weekdays (Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed? Wait, no. Wait, Sep 1 is Thursday, Sep 2 Friday, Sep 3 Saturday, Sep 4 Sunday, Sep 5 Monday, Sep 6 Tuesday, Sep 7 Wednesday. So in that first week, the weekdays are Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. That's 5 weekdays. Then the next week (Sep 8-14): Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Again 5 weekdays. Then Sep 15-21: same. Then Sep 22-28: same. Then Sep 29-30: two days. So that's 4 weeks (28 days) with 5 weekdays each, so 4*5=20, plus 2 days (Sep 29 and 30) which are Thursday and Friday, so 2 weekdays. Total 22. So that's correct.\n\nThen October: October 1 is Saturday, October 2 is Sunday. So the only days in October are October 1 (Saturday) and October 2 (Sunday). So no weekdays in October.\n\nSo total weekdays would be August (23) + September (22) = 45. Wait, but wait. Wait, the start date is July 31 (Sunday), which is a weekend. So that's not counted. The end date is October 2 (Sunday), which is also a weekend. So the total is 23 (August) + 22 (September) = 45 weekdays. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, August has 23 weekdays. September has 22. So 23 + 22 = 45. But let me check another way. Let's count the total days between July 31 and October 2 inclusive, then subtract the weekends.\n\nTotal days: July 31 to October 2 is 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 2 (October) days? Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is the start date. Then August has 31 days, September 30, and October 2. So total days from July 31 to October 2 inclusive is (31 days in July) + (31 days in August) + (30 days in September) + 2 days in October? Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is day 1. Then August has 31 days, so from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September has 30 days, so from August 31 to September 30 is 30 days. Then October 1 and 2 are 2 days. So total days from July 31 to October 2 inclusive is 31 + 30 + 2 = 63 days? Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is day 1. Then August has 31 days, so from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September has 30 days, so from August 31 to September 30 is 30 days. Then October 1 and 2 are 2 days. So total days is 31 (July) + 30 (September) + 2 (October) = 63 days? Wait, but that's not correct. Because from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days (including July 31 and August 31). Then from August 31 to September 30 is 30 days (including August 31 and September 30). Then October 1 and 2 are 2 days. So total is 31 + 30 + 2 = 63 days. But that would be from July 31 to October 2 inclusive. So total days is 63.\n\nNow, how many weekends are in that period? Let's see. The total days are 63. The number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) would be?\n\nWe know that July 31 is Sunday. So the first day is Sunday. Then the next day is Monday (August 1). So the weekends in this period would be Sundays and Saturdays. Let's count the number of Sundays and Saturdays between July 31 and October 2.\n\nJuly 31 is Sunday. Then August 7 is Sunday, August 14, 21, 28. Then September 4, 11, 18, 25. Then October 2 is Sunday. So Sundays are July 31, August 7, 14, 21, 28, September 4, 11, 18, 25, October 2. That's 10 Sundays.\n\nNow Saturdays: Let's see. The first Saturday after July 31 is August 6 (since July 31 is Sunday, August 1 is Monday, so August 6 is Saturday). Then August 13, 20, 27. Then September 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. Then October 7 is Saturday, but October 2 is the end date, so October 7 is beyond. So Saturdays in the period are August 6, 13, 20, 27, September 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. That's 9 Saturdays.\n\nSo total weekends are 10 Sundays + 9 Saturdays = 19 days.\n\nSo total weekdays would be total days (63) minus weekends (19) = 44. Wait, but earlier calculation said 45. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nFirst, Sundays: July 31 (1), August 7 (2), 14 (3), 21 (4), 28 (5), September 4 (6), 11 (7), 18 (8), 25 (9), October 2 (10). That's 10 Sundays.\n\nSaturdays: August 6 (1), 13 (2), 20 (3), 27 (4), September 3 (5), 10 (6), 17 (7), 24 (8), 31 (9). That's 9 Saturdays. So total 19 weekends. 63-19=44 weekdays. But earlier calculation said 23 (August) + 22 (September) = 45. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the August and September counts. Let me check again.\n\nAugust has 31 days. Let's count the number of weekdays in August. August 1 is Monday. So the first week (Aug 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri). Then the next weeks: Aug 8-14 (5 weekdays), Aug 15-21 (5), Aug 22-28 (5), Aug 29-31 (3 days: Mon, Tue, Wed). So that's 4*5 + 3 = 23 weekdays. That's correct.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. September 1 is Thursday. So the first week (Sep 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed). Then the next weeks: Sep 8-14 (5), Sep 15-21 (5), Sep 22-28 (5), Sep 29-30 (2 days: Thu, Fri). So that's 4*5 + 2 = 22 weekdays. So total 23 + 22 = 45. But according to the total days minus weekends, it's 44. So there's a conflict here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 63. Let me check again. From July 31 to October 2 inclusive. July has 31 days. So July 31 is day 1. August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, no. Wait, if July 31 is day 1, then August 1 is day 2, August 2 day 3, ..., August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is day 1. Then August 1 is day 2, August 2 day 3, ..., August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, that can't be. Wait, July has 31 days. So from July 1 to July 31 is 31 days. So July 31 is day 31. Then August 1 is day 32. August 31 is day 32 + 30 = day 62. Then September 1 is day 63, September 30 is day 63 + 29 = day 92. Then October 1 is day 93, October 2 is day 94. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the total days between July 31 and October 2 inclusive.\n\nWait, the number of days between two dates inclusive is (end date - start date + 1). So July 31 to October 2 is (October 2 - July 31) + 1. Let me calculate the number of days between July 31 and October 2.\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days (since July 31 is the start, August 31 is 31 days later). Then September has 30 days, so from August 31 to September 30 is 30 days. Then October 1 and 2 are 2 days. So total days is 31 (July 31 to August 31) + 30 (September) + 2 (October 1-2) = 63 days. So that's correct. So total days is 63.\n\nBut according to the other method, total days is 63. Then weekends are 19, so weekdays are 44. But the other method gives 45. So there's a discrepancy. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me check the weekends again. Maybe I missed a day.\n\nSundays: July 31 (1), August 7 (2), 14 (3), 21 (4), 28 (5), September 4 (6), 11 (7), 18 (8), 25 (9), October 2 (10). That's 10 Sundays.\n\nSaturdays: August 6 (1), 13 (2), 20 (3), 27 (4), September 3 (5), 10 (6), 17 (7), 24 (8), 31 (9). That's 9 Saturdays. So total 19 weekends. 63-19=44.\n\nBut according to the per-month count, it's 23 (August) + 22 (September) = 45. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the per-month count is wrong. Let me check August again. August has 31 days. Let's list the weekdays in August.\n\nAugust 1 (Mon) to August 31 (Wed). Let's count the number of weekdays.\n\nEach week has 5 weekdays.

So the period is from Saturday the 29th to Sunday the 30th. \n\nNow, the question is, are there any Tuesdays in this two-day period? Well, if the first day is Saturday, the next day is Sunday. So the days in between are Saturday and Sunday. There's no Tuesday in there. So the answer should be zero?\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me think. Let's list the dates:\n\n- October 29, 2022: Saturday\n- October 30, 2022: Sunday\n\nSo the two days are Saturday and Sunday. Tuesday is the third day of the week. So between those two dates, there's no Tuesday. Therefore, the count of Tuesdays is zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify the actual days. Let me think. If I check an online calendar or use a date calculator. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me recall that October 29, 2022, was indeed a Saturday. For example, October 24, 2022, was a Monday, so adding 5 days would make October 29 a Saturday. Then October 30 is Sunday. So yes, the two days are Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, no Tuesdays in between. So the answer is 0.", "0"], [74, "Between Saturday, April 9, 2022 and Friday, July 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Friday occur? Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many Fridays there are between Saturday, April 9, 2022, and Friday, July 1, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many Fridays are in there.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just count the Fridays directly. But how? Let me think. Maybe I can start by checking the day of the week for April 9, 2022. The problem says it's a Saturday. So April 9 is a Saturday. Then, April 10 would be a Sunday, and so on. Let me confirm that. If April 9 is a Saturday, then April 10 is Sunday, April 11 is Monday, April 12 is Tuesday, April 13 is Wednesday, April 14 is Thursday, April 15 is Friday. So April 15, 2022 is a Friday. That's the first Friday in the period.\n\nNow, I need to find all the Fridays from April 15 up to July 1, 2022. Let me figure out how many weeks and extra days there are in this period. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the start and end dates and then divide by 7, but since the start date is a Saturday, the number of Fridays would depend on how many full weeks there are and the remaining days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down month by month. Let's check each month's days and count the Fridays.\n\nFirst, April. April 9 is a Saturday. So April 15 is the first Friday. Then each subsequent Friday is 7 days later. Let's see how many Fridays are in April. April has 30 days. Let's check the last day of April. April 30, 2022. Let me figure out what day that is. Since April 15 is a Friday, adding 14 days (2 weeks) would be April 29, which is also a Friday. Then April 30 is a Saturday. So in April, the Fridays are on 15, 22, and 29. That's three Fridays.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, April 9 is Saturday. So April 15 is Friday. Then April 22 is Friday (15 +7), and April 29 is Friday (22+7). Then May 6 would be the next Friday. But April has 30 days, so April 30 is Saturday. So yes, three Fridays in April.\n\nNow moving to May. May has 31 days. Let's figure out what day May 1 is. Since April 30 is a Saturday, May 1 is a Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then the first Friday in May would be May 4 (since May 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, 3 is Tuesday, 4 is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Sunday. So May 1: Sunday, May 2: Monday, May 3: Tuesday, May 4: Wednesday, May 5: Thursday, May 6: Friday. So the first Friday in May is May 6. Then the next ones are 13, 20, 27. Then May 31 is a Friday? Wait, May 6 + 7 days is May 13, then 20, 27. Then June 3 would be the next Friday. But May has 31 days. So May 31 is a Friday? Let me check. May 6 is Friday. Adding 25 days (3 weeks and 4 days) would be May 31. Wait, 6 + 25 = 31. So May 31 is 25 days after May 6. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So May 6 + 4 days is May 10, but that's not right. Wait, maybe I should count the days step by step. May 6 is Friday. May 7 is Saturday, 8 Sunday, 9 Monday, 10 Tuesday, 11 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, 13 Friday. So May 13 is Friday. Then May 20, 27, and June 3. Wait, May 27 is Friday. Then June 3 is Friday. So May has 6, 13, 20, 27. That's four Fridays in May.\n\nWait, but May has 31 days. So May 31 is a Saturday? Because May 27 is Friday, then 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. Wait, that's not right. Wait, May 27 is Friday. Then May 28 is Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. So May 31 is Tuesday. So the next Friday after May 27 is June 3. So May has four Fridays: 6, 13, 20, 27. That's four.\n\nNow June. June has 30 days. Let's figure out what day June 1 is. Since May 31 is Tuesday, June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. Then the first Friday in June would be June 3 (since June 1 is Wednesday, 2 Thursday, 3 Friday). Then the next ones are 10, 17, 24, and 31. Wait, June 31 is the last day of June. But June has 30 days, so June 30 is the last day. So June 31 doesn't exist. So the Fridays in June are 3, 10, 17, 24. That's four Fridays. Wait, June 3 is Friday, then adding 7 days each time: 10, 17, 24. Then 31 would be the next, but June only has 30 days. So that's three Fridays? Wait, no. Wait, June 3 is Friday. Then June 10 is Friday (3+7), June 17, June 24. Then June 31 is the next, but that's beyond June 30. So that's three Fridays in June? Wait, but June 3 is Friday, then 10, 17, 24. That's four Fridays. Wait, June 3, 10, 17, 24. That's four. Because 3 + 7*3 = 24. So yes, four Fridays in June.\n\nWait, but June 30 is the last day. Let me check. June 3 is Friday. Then June 10 is Friday. Then June 17, 24, and then 31. But June 31 is not in the period. So June 24 is the last Friday in June. So that's four Fridays in June.\n\nNow July. The period ends on July 1, 2022, which is a Friday. So July 1 is a Friday. So that's one Friday in July. But wait, the question says between April 9 and July 1, inclusive. So July 1 is included. So July 1 is a Friday. So that's one Friday in July.\n\nSo adding up the Fridays: April has 3, May has 4, June has 4, July has 1. Total is 3 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12? Wait, that's 12. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, April: 15, 22, 29. That's three. May: 6, 13, 20, 27. Four. June: 3, 10, 17, 24. Four. July: 1. So total is 3+4+4+1=12. But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the days. Let me check the dates again. Let me check the day of the week for July 1, 2022. Since the problem says that July 1 is a Friday. So that's correct. So July 1 is a Friday. So that's one.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other Fridays in July. July 1 is Friday, then July 8, 15, 22, 29. But the period ends on July 1, so only July 1 is included. So that's one.\n\nSo total is 3+4+4+1=12. But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the total number of days between April 9 and July 1, inclusive. Let's calculate that. April has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 22 days (30-9=21, plus 1 for inclusive). Wait, no. Wait, the number of days from April 9 to April 30 inclusive is 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. Then May has 31 days, June 30 days, and July 1 day. So total days is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days. Wait, 22 + 31 is 53, plus 30 is 83, plus 1 is 84. So 84 days in total. Now, 84 divided by 7 is 12. So there should be exactly 12 Fridays. Because 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. So that would mean 12 Fridays. So that matches the count I did earlier. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 12.", "12"], [74, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check if the dates are correct. Wait, the start date is October 24, 2022, which is a Monday. The end date is January 16, 2022, which is also a Monday. But wait, January 16, 2022, is actually before October 24, 2022. That can't be right. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the question? Because January 16 is earlier than October 24. So maybe the end date is supposed to be later? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual dates.\n\nWait, October 24, 2022, is in the fall, and January 16, 2022, is in the winter. But 2022 is a non-leap year. Let me confirm the actual dates. Wait, October 24, 2022, is a Monday. Then, January 16, 2022, is a Monday as well. But that would mean the period is from a later date to an earlier date, which doesn't make sense. So maybe the end date is supposed to be January 16, 2023? Or maybe the user intended the dates to be in reverse? Because otherwise, the start date is after the end date. That would make the calculation impossible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the user meant from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022? But the question says from Monday, October 24, 2022, to Monday, January 16, 2022. That seems incorrect. \n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual calendar. Let me think. October 24, 2022, is a Monday. Let's count the days from October 24 to January 16. But since January 16 is earlier than October 24, the period would be from October 24 to January 16, but that's going backward. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the question. The end date should be after the start date. Maybe the user meant from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022? Or perhaps the end date is January 16, 2023? Let me check the actual dates again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the end date is January 16, 2023. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the period would be from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. But the question says 2022. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the dates to be in the same year but the end date is later. Wait, October 24 is in October, and January 16 is in January. So if the start date is October 24, 2022, and the end date is January 16, 2023, that would make sense. But the question says 2022 for both. So maybe the user made a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, but that would be a negative period. So perhaps the correct dates are from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the calculation would be possible. But the question says the start date is October 24, 2022, and the end date is January 16, 2022. So I need to clarify this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days between those two dates, but the dates are in the same year. Wait, October 24, 2022, is a Monday. Let me check what day January 16, 2022, is. Wait, January 16, 2022, is a Sunday. Wait, no. Let me check. Let me think. January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. So January 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday. So January 16 would be 16 days later. Let's count: 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri), 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue), 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri), 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun). So January 16, 2022, is a Sunday. Therefore, the end date is a Sunday, which is a weekend. But the start date is a Monday. So the period from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, is going backward. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, the question must have a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the end date to be January 16, 2023. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the period would be from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. Let me calculate that. But the question says 2022 for both dates. So I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the original question again. The user wrote: \"from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)\". So the start date is October 24, 2022, and the end date is January 16, 2022. But that's impossible because January 16 is earlier than October 24. Therefore, the correct way is to reverse the dates. So the user probably meant from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. But the question says the other way around. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days between those two dates, but the dates are in the same year. Wait, but October 24 is after January 16 in 2022. So the period would be from October 24 to January 16, which is not possible. Therefore, the question must have a mistake. \n\nBut since the user is asking for the answer, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the dates are correct, and perhaps the end date is actually later. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the end date to be January 16, 2023. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days between October 24, 2022, and January 16, 2023. \n\nOctober has 31 days. So from October 24 to October 31 is 31 - 24 = 7 days (including October 24). Then November has 30 days, December has 31 days, and January 1 to 16 is 16 days. So total days: 7 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 16 (January) = 7 + 30 = 37, 37 + 31 = 68, 68 + 16 = 84 days. So total days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023, inclusive is 84 days. But wait, if the start date is October 24 and the end date is January 16, then the total days would be 84. But since the user said the end date is January 16, 2022, which is earlier, that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the year. Let me check the actual dates again. If the end date is January 16, 2023, then the calculation is correct. But the user wrote 2022. So perhaps the user intended the end date to be January 16, 2023. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, but that would be a negative period. So the answer would be zero. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023, but the question has a typo. Since the user is asking for the answer, I need to proceed. \n\nAssuming that the end date is January 16, 2023, then the total days are 84. Now, to find the number of business days, we need to subtract the weekends. \n\nLet me check the days of the week for each month. \n\nOctober 24, 2022, is a Monday. So October 24 is Monday. Then October 25 is Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So October has 31 days. From October 24 to October 31: 8 days. But since October 24 is included, the days are 24 (Mon), 25 (Tue), 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri), 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon). So in October, from 24 to 31, there are 8 days. The weekends are 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun). So 2 weekends in October. \n\nThen November has 30 days. November 1 is Tuesday (since October 31 is Monday, November 1 is Tuesday). So November 1 is Tuesday, 2 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, etc. So in November, the weekends are 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 8 weekends in November. \n\nDecember has 31 days. December 1 is a Thursday (since November 30 is a Wednesday, December 1 is Thursday). So December 1 is Thursday, 2 Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, etc. The weekends in December are 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 31 (Sat). That's 9 weekends in December. \n\nJanuary 1 is a Friday (since December 31 is a Saturday). So January 1 is Friday, 2 Saturday, 3 Sunday, 4 Monday, 5 Tuesday, 6 Wednesday, 7 Thursday, 8 Friday, 9 Saturday, 10 Sunday, 11 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 13 Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday. Wait, but the end date is January 16, which is a Saturday. So in January, from 1 to 16, the weekends are 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun), 16 (Sat). That's 5 weekends. \n\nSo total weekends: October 2, November 8, December 9, January 5. Wait, let me recount. \n\nOctober: 2 weekends (29 and 30). November: 8 weekends (5,6,12,13,19,20,26,27). December: 9 weekends (3,4,10,11,17,18,24,25,31). January: 5 weekends (2,3,9,10,16). So total weekends: 2 + 8 + 9 + 5 = 24 weekends. \n\nTotal days from October 24 to January 16, 2023, inclusive is 84 days. So business days would be 84 - 24 = 60. \n\nBut wait, the user's question says the end date is January 16, 2022, which is earlier than October 24, 2022. So this is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer must be that the period is invalid. But since the user is asking for an answer, maybe they made a mistake in the dates. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the end date to be January 16, 2023. In that case, the answer would be 60 business days. But since the user wrote 2022, I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, but that would be a negative period. So the answer would be zero. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. Let's calculate that. \n\nJanuary 16, 2022, is a Sunday. Let's calculate the days from January 16 to October 24. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. From January 16 to January 31: 31 - 16 = 15 days (including January 16). February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, October 24. \n\nSo total days: 15 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 24 (Oct) = 15 + 28 = 43, +31 = 74, +30 = 104, +31 = 135, +30 = 165, +31 = 196, +31 = 227, +30 = 257, +24 = 281 days. \n\nNow, the total days from January 16 to October 24 is 281 days. Now, we need to subtract the weekends. \n\nJanuary 16 is Sunday. Let's count the weekends in each month. \n\nJanuary: from 16 to 31. January 16 is Sunday, 17 Monday, 18 Tuesday, 19 Wednesday, 20 Thursday, 21 Friday, 22 Saturday, 23 Sunday, 24 Monday, 25 Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So in January, the weekends are 16 (Sun), 22 (Sat), 23 (Sun), 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun). Wait, but January 16 is included. So from 16 to 31, the weekends are 16 (Sun), 22 (Sat), 23 (Sun), 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun). That's 5 weekends. \n\nFebruary has 28 days. February 1 is a Wednesday (since January 31 is Monday). So February 1 is Wednesday, 2 Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday, etc. The weekends in February are 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun), 11 (Sat), 12 (Sun), 18 (Sat), 19 (Sun), 25 (Sat), 26 (Sun). That's 8 weekends. \n\nMarch has 31 days. March 1 is a Tuesday (since February 28 is a Tuesday). March 1 is Tuesday, 2 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, etc. The weekends in March are 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 8 weekends. \n\nApril has 30 days. April 1 is a Friday (since March 31 is a Thursday). April 1 is Friday, 2 Saturday, 3 Sunday, 4 Monday, etc. The weekends in April are 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun), 16 (Sat),"], [74, "On which weekday did October 1, 2022 fall? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022 fell on. Let me think. I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but maybe I should verify that. Let me try to recall some key dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. If I can figure out the days for other dates, maybe I can work backward. Alternatively, I could use a known reference point. Let me think. October 1, 2022... Maybe I can check the number of days between known dates. For instance, if I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then October 2 would be Sunday, and so on. But how do I confirm that? Alternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 was not a leap year, so February had 28 days. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that I know some other dates. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. July 4, 2022: if I count the days from July 4 to October 1, that's 3 months. July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. August has 31 days, and September has 30 days. So July 4 to October 1 is 27 + 31 + 30 = 88 days. Wait, no, because from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since July 4 is day 0, then July 5 is +1, so July 31 is 27 days later). Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days gets to August 31. Then September has 30 days, so adding 30 days gets to September 30. Then October 1 is one more day. So total days from July 4 to October 1 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 89 days? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me do it again. From July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since July 4 is day 0, July 5 is +1, ..., July 31 is 27 days later). Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days gets to August 31. Then September has 30 days, so adding 30 days gets to September 30. Then October 1 is one day after September 30. So total days from July 4 to October 1 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 89 days. Wait, but that seems like 27 days in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, and 1 day in October. So total 89 days. If July 4 is a Monday, then adding 89 days to that date would give me October 1. Now, 89 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 5 days. So 89 days later would be 12 weeks and 5 days. So if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 5 days would be Monday + 5 days = Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. That seems to check out. Alternatively, I can check another date. For example, I know that October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think. If I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then working backward, December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then November 30, 2022 would be a Thursday (since December has 31 days, so 31 days before December 31 is November 30, which is 31 days before. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So December 31 is Saturday, so November 30 would be Saturday minus 3 days, which is Wednesday? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, if December 31 is Saturday, then December 30 is Friday, December 29 is Thursday, December 28 is Wednesday, etc. Wait, maybe I should think of it as moving backward. If December 31 is Saturday, then November 30 is 31 days before. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So subtracting 3 days from Saturday would be Wednesday. So November 30, 2022 is a Wednesday. Then October 31, 2022 would be 30 days before November 30. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So subtracting 2 days from Wednesday would be Monday. So October 31, 2022 is a Monday. Then October 1 is 30 days before October 31. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So subtracting 2 days from Monday would be Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is a Saturday. That matches the previous calculation. So both methods lead me to Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Wednesday, September 21 to Wednesday, November 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Respond with just the number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Saturdays fall between Wednesday, September 21, 2022, and Wednesday, November 30, 2022, inclusive. Hmm, first, I should figure out the dates involved and then check each Saturday in that range.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The start date is September 21, 2022, which is a Wednesday. The end date is November 30, 2022, also a Wednesday. So the period spans from one Wednesday to another Wednesday. That's a total of how many days? Let me calculate that.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (including both start and end). Then October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. But wait, the end date is November 30, so adding those up: 10 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) = 71 days total. Wait, but wait, if the start is September 21 and end is November 30, inclusive, then the total days would be (30 - 21 + 1) + 31 + 30 = 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. So 71 days in total.\n\nNow, since the start date is a Wednesday, the next day is Thursday, and so on. I need to find how many Saturdays are in this 71-day period. Let's think about the days of the week.\n\nEach week has 7 days. So in 71 days, there are 10 weeks (70 days) and 1 extra day. Since the start date is a Wednesday, the first day of the period is Wednesday. So the first Saturday would be the 4th day (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday). Then each week after that would have one Saturday. So in 10 weeks, there are 10 Saturdays. Then the extra day is the 71st day. Let's check what day that is.\n\nStarting from Wednesday, September 21 (day 1), adding 70 days would bring us to day 71, which is the same as the start date's day of the week. Wait, because 70 days is exactly 10 weeks. So day 71 would be Wednesday again. But the end date is November 30, which is a Wednesday. So the 71st day is the end date. Therefore, the extra day is a Wednesday, which is not a Saturday. Therefore, the total number of Saturdays would be 10.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Let me list out the dates. Let's see:\n\nStart date: September 21, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's check what day September 21 is. Wait, I think I need to confirm that. Wait, maybe I should check the actual calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to rely on my knowledge. Wait, but I think I remember that September 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me confirm that. For example, September 20, 2022 was a Tuesday. So September 21 is Wednesday. Correct.\n\nSo the first Saturday in the period would be September 22 (Thursday), 23 (Friday), 24 (Saturday). Wait, no. Wait, September 21 is Wednesday. So the next day is Thursday (22), Friday (23), Saturday (24). So the first Saturday is September 24, 2022. Then each week after that. So the next Saturday would be October 1 (since September 24 is Saturday, then October 1 is the next Saturday, which is 7 days later. Then October 8, 15, 22, 29. Then November 5, 12, 19, 26. Then December 3, but wait, the end date is November 30. So let's count them.\n\nSo starting from September 24 (Saturday), then October 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Saturdays in September and October. Then November has 5 Saturdays: 5, 12, 19, 26. Wait, November 30 is a Wednesday, so November 26 is a Saturday. Then November 26 is the last Saturday in the period. So that's 5 (from September and October) plus 4 in November? Wait, let me count again.\n\nWait, September 24 (1st), October 1 (2nd), 8 (3rd), 15 (4th), 22 (5th), 29 (6th). That's 6 Saturdays in September and October. Then November: 5 (Saturday), 12, 19, 26. That's 4 more. So total of 6 + 4 = 10 Saturdays. So that matches the earlier calculation of 10 weeks (70 days) with 10 Saturdays. So the answer is 10.", "10"], [74, "In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. I need to figure out what day of the week April 3rd falls on, given that January 1st is a Tuesday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. Since January 1st is a Tuesday, January 1st is day 0 (or maybe day 1?), but I need to count the days from January 1st to April 3rd. Wait, if I start counting from January 1st as day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. But maybe it's easier to count the number of days between the two dates. \n\nSo, from January 1st to April 3rd, how many days is that? Let's calculate:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, etc. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of days after January 1st. So, if I want to find the day of the week for April 3rd, I need to find how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd, then take that number modulo 7 to find the offset from Tuesday.\n\nLet me calculate the total days:\n\nJanuary: 31 days. But since we start on January 1st, the number of days from January 1st to the end of January is 31 days. But if we're going up to April 3rd, we need to add February and March.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"a year where Tuesday is January 1st\". It doesn't mention leap years. But since the problem is about a specific date, maybe we need to assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe it's not necessary. Wait, but if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. However, since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume it's a non-leap year. But wait, maybe the problem is designed in a way that doesn't require knowing if it's a leap year. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem is in a year where January 1st is a Tuesday. So, if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we need to assume it's a non-leap year. But maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, the number of days would be different. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we need to assume it's a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a specific year, but since it's not given, perhaps the answer is based on a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption. So, assuming it's a non-leap year, February has 28 days, March has 31 days.\n\nSo, from January 1st to April 3rd:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (but since we start on January 1st, the days after January 1st would be 30 days in January, then February has 28, March has 31, and then April 3rd is 3 days into April. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the total days from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive? Or exclusive?\n\nWait, if January 1st is day 0 (Tuesday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Wednesday), and so on. So, to find the day of the week for April 3rd, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd, then take that number modulo 7. Because each week has 7 days, so the day of the week will cycle every 7 days.\n\nSo, the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd is:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (from Jan 1 to Jan 31). But since we start on Jan 1, the days after Jan 1 would be 30 days in January. Then February has 28 days, March has 31 days, and then April 3rd is 3 days into April. Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd inclusive, that would be:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28, March has 31, and April 3 is 3 days. So total days from Jan 1 to April 3 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93. Wait, but that would be the total days from Jan 1 to April 3 inclusive. But if we want the number of days between Jan 1 and April 3, not including Jan 1, then it's 92 days. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, if January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday), then the next day, January 2 is day 1 (Wednesday), and so on. So, the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is (April 3 - January 1) days. So, if I calculate the total days between those two dates, that's the number of days to add to Tuesday to find the day of the week.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of days between January 1 and April 3. Let's break it down:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30). Then February has 28 days (so days 31 to 58), March has 31 days (days 59 to 89), and April 3 is day 90 (since day 89 is March 31, then April 1 is day 90, April 2 is 91, April 3 is 92). Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I need to count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days from January 1 to April 3. Let's do that:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so adding that gives 59 + 31 = 90 days. Then April 3 is 3 days into April, so total days from January 1 to April 3 is 90 + 3 = 93 days. But if January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is day 92 (since day 0 is Jan 1, day 1 is Jan 2, ..., day 92 is April 3). Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday), then:\n\n- January 1: day 0 (Tuesday)\n- January 2: day 1 (Wednesday)\n- ...\n- January 31: day 30 (since 31 days in January, so day 30 is the last day of January)\n- February 1: day 31 (which would be a Wednesday, since 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the day of the week for each month.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of days between January 1 and April 3, then take that number modulo 7. Because each week has 7 days, so the day of the week will be (starting day + number of days) mod 7.\n\nSo, if January 1 is Tuesday, then the day of the week for any date is (Tuesday + (number of days since Jan 1)) mod 7.\n\nSo, the key is to find how many days are between January 1 and April 3, inclusive or exclusive? Wait, if I want to find the day of the week for April 3, then the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is (April 3 - January 1) days. So, if I calculate that, then add that to Tuesday, and take modulo 7.\n\nBut how to calculate the number of days between January 1 and April 3?\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year), March has 31 days. Then April 3 is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1 to April 3 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93. But that's the total number of days from January 1 to April 3 inclusive. However, if January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is day 92 (since day 0 is Jan 1, day 1 is Jan 2, ..., day 92 is April 3). Wait, that's because 31 days in January (Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days, so day 30 is Jan 31). Then February has 28 days, so day 30 + 28 = day 58 (end of February). March has 31 days, so day 58 + 31 = day 89 (end of March). Then April 1 is day 90, April 2 is 91, April 3 is 92. So the total number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 92 days. Therefore, the number of days after January 1 is 92 days. So, the day of the week is (Tuesday + 92 days) mod 7.\n\nBut since each week has 7 days, 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day (since 13*7=91, 92-91=1). So 92 days is 13 weeks and 1 day. Therefore, adding 92 days to Tuesday would be Tuesday + 1 day = Wednesday. So April 3 would be a Wednesday?\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, let me check again. If January 1 is Tuesday, then January 8 is also Tuesday (7 days later). So, adding 7 days brings us back to the same day. So, 92 days is 13 weeks (91 days) plus 1 day. So, 91 days later is Tuesday again, then 1 more day is Wednesday. Therefore, April 3 would be a Wednesday. But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step:\n\nJanuary 1 is day 0 (Tuesday).\n\nJanuary 1 + 31 days is January 31 (day 30). Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31. February has 28 days, so February 28 is day 31 + 27 = day 58. March 1 is day 59. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 59 + 30 = day 89. April 1 is day 90, April 2 is day 91, April 3 is day 92. So yes, April 3 is day 92. So 92 days after January 1. So 92 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 1. So 92 days is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Tuesday is Wednesday. Therefore, April 3 is a Wednesday.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another method. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the days for each month:\n\n- January has 31 days. So January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Wednesday, January 31 is Thursday. So January 31 is Thursday.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So February 1 is Friday (since January 31 is Thursday, then February 1 is Friday). Then February 28 is a Friday (since 28 days is 4 weeks, so same day). So February 28 is Friday.\n\nMarch 1 is Saturday. March has 31 days. So March 1 is Saturday. March 7 is Saturday, 14, 21, 28. March 29 is Saturday, March 30 is Sunday, March 31 is Monday.\n\nApril 1 is Tuesday. Then April 2 is Wednesday, April 3 is Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. Wait, according to this, April 1 is Tuesday, so April 3 would be Thursday. But earlier calculation said Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, this is a problem. Let me check again. If January 1 is Tuesday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 8: Tuesday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 22: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 29: Tuesday\n\nThen January 30: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 31: Thursday\n\nSo that's correct. Then February 1 is Friday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is Friday (since 28 days is 4 weeks). So March 1 is Saturday. March has 31 days. March 1 is Saturday. March 7 is Saturday, 14, 21, 28. March 29 is Saturday, March 30 is Sunday, March 31 is Monday. Then April 1 is Tuesday. So April 1 is Tuesday, April 2 is Wednesday, April 3 is Thursday. So according to this, April 3 is Thursday. But earlier calculation said Wednesday. So which is correct?\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The previous calculation said that 92 days after January 1 is April 3. But according to this step-by-step, April 1 is Tuesday, so April 3 is Thursday. So that suggests that the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 92 days, but according to the step-by-step, April 3 is 92 days after January 1. But according to the step-by-step, April 3 is Thursday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the modulo calculation. Let me check again. 92 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 1. So 92 days is 13 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Tuesday would be Wednesday. But according to the step-by-step, it's Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nLet me check the step-by-step again. Let's count the days from January 1 to April 3.\n\nJanuary 1 is Tuesday.\n\nJanuary 1 + 31 days is January 31. So January 31 is 30 days after January 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Tuesday + 2 days is Thursday. That matches the previous step-by-step. So January 31 is Thursday.\n\nThen February has 28 days. So February 28 is 28 days after January 31. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so same day. So February 28 is Thursday. Then March 1 is Friday. March has 31 days. So March 1 is Friday. March 31 is 30 days after March 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Friday + 2 days is Sunday. Wait, but earlier step-by-step said March 31 is Monday. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, March 1 is Friday. March 7 is Friday, 14, 21, 28. March 29 is Friday. March 30 is Saturday, March 31 is Sunday. So March 31 is Sunday. Then April 1 is Monday. Wait, that contradicts the previous step-by-step where I said April 1 is Tuesday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, earlier I thought that March 31 is Monday, but according to this, March 31 is Sunday. So that's a problem. Let me check again.\n\nIf March 1 is Friday, then March 1 is Friday. March 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. March 29 is Friday. March 30 is Saturday, March 31 is Sunday. So April 1 is Monday. Therefore, April 1 is Monday. Then April 2 is Tuesday, April 3 is Wednesday. Wait, that's different from the previous step-by-step. So where did I go wrong before?\n\nEarlier, I thought that March 1 is Saturday. But according"], [74, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Thursday, June 30 to Tuesday, September 6, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Saturdays fall between Thursday, June 30, 2022, and Tuesday, September 6, 2022, inclusive. Hmm, first, I should figure out the dates involved and then check which Saturdays are in that range.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The start date is June 30, 2022, which is a Thursday. The end date is September 6, 2022, which is a Tuesday. So the period spans from June 30 to September 6, including both days.\n\nNow, I need to find all the Saturdays in this period. Let me start by figuring out the first Saturday after June 30. Since June 30 is a Thursday, the next day is Friday, June 31 (which is a Friday), then July 1 is a Saturday. So the first Saturday in the range is July 1, 2022.\n\nNow, I need to count all the Saturdays from July 1 up to September 6. Let me break this down into months. July, August, and September.\n\nFirst, July 2022. July has 31 days. July 1 is a Saturday. Then every 7 days after that. So the Saturdays in July would be July 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Let me check: July 1 is Saturday, adding 7 days each time. That's 5 Saturdays in July.\n\nNext, August 2022. August has 31 days. Let's see, the next Saturday after July 29 is August 5 (since July 29 + 7 days is August 5). Then August 12, 19, 26. Wait, August 26 is the last one. Let me count: 5, 12, 19, 26. That's 4 Saturdays in August.\n\nNow September 2022. The first Saturday in September would be September 3 (since August 26 is a Saturday, adding 7 days is September 2, but wait, August 26 is a Saturday. August 26 + 7 days is September 2. Wait, but September 2 is a Saturday? Wait, let me check. Wait, August 26 is a Saturday. Then August 27 is Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday, 31 Thursday. Then September 1 is Friday, September 2 is Saturday. So yes, September 2 is a Saturday. But the end date is September 6. So the Saturdays in September would be September 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. But wait, September 30 is beyond the end date of September 6. So the last Saturday in the range would be September 2, 9, 16, 23. Wait, September 2 is within the range (since the end date is September 6). Then September 9 is also within the range? Wait, September 6 is the end date. So September 9 is after September 6. So the last Saturday in the range would be September 2, 9, 16, 23? Wait, no. Wait, September 2 is a Saturday. Then adding 7 days is September 9, which is after September 6. So only September 2 is in the range. Wait, but September 6 is the end date. So September 2 is within the range. Then September 9 is after September 6, so not included. So in September, only one Saturday: September 2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The end date is September 6. So the Saturday on September 2 is included. Then the next Saturday would be September 9, which is after September 6. So only one Saturday in September.\n\nSo total Saturdays would be 5 (July) + 4 (August) + 1 (September) = 10?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the counts.\n\nJuly: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 days. Correct.\n\nAugust: 5, 12, 19, 26. That's 4 days. Correct.\n\nSeptember: 2. That's 1 day. So total 5+4+1=10.\n\nBut wait, the end date is September 6. So September 2 is included. But what about September 9? It's not included. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the actual dates. Let me confirm the days of the week for these dates.\n\nJune 30, 2022 is a Thursday. July 1 is a Saturday. Then July 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. That's correct.\n\nAugust 5 is Saturday. Then August 12, 19, 26. That's four Saturdays.\n\nSeptember 2 is Saturday. Then September 9 is the next one, which is after September 6. So yes, only one in September.\n\nSo total of 5+4+1=10 Saturdays. But wait, wait. Wait, the start date is June 30, which is a Thursday. So the first Saturday is July 1. The end date is September 6, which is a Tuesday. So the last Saturday in the range is September 2. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's another Saturday in September. Let me check the actual calendar for September 2022. Let me think. September 1, 2022 is a Friday. So September 2 is Saturday. Then September 3 is Sunday, 4 Monday, 5 Tuesday, 6 Wednesday. So yes, September 2 is the only Saturday in September within the range.\n\nSo total of 10 Saturdays. But wait, wait. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the dates again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between June 30 and September 6, then divide by 7 and adjust for the start and end days.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach. Let's list all the Saturdays between June 30 and September 6.\n\nStarting from July 1, 2022 (Saturday), then adding 7 days each time:\n\nJuly 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (5 Saturdays in July).\n\nAugust 5, 12, 19, 26 (4 in August).\n\nSeptember 2 (1 in September).\n\nTotal 5+4+1=10.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Then, subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. July 17, 2022 is a Sunday. The end date is August 23, 2022, which is a Tuesday. So the period starts on a Sunday and ends on a Tuesday. Let me break this down into weeks and days.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many days are between July 17 and August 23, inclusive. To do this, I can calculate the number of days in July after July 17, then add the days in August up to August 23.\n\nJuly has 31 days. July 17 is the starting day. So from July 17 to July 31 inclusive, that's 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. Wait, no. Wait, if I include both the start and end dates, then from July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. But then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total days would be 15 + 23 = 38 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, July 17 is day 1, July 18 is day 2, ..., July 31 is day 15. Then August 1 is day 16, and August 23 is day 16 + 22 = day 38. So total of 38 days. But I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a date calculator or check the actual dates. But since I don't have that here, I need to calculate manually. Let me check the days again.\n\nJuly 17 is Sunday. Let's count the days in July. July has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31 is 15 days (including both ends). Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total is 15 + 23 = 38 days. So total days between July 17 and August 23 inclusive is 38 days.\n\nNow, out of these 38 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nSince the start date is Sunday, July 17, the first day is a Sunday. Then the next day, July 18, is a Monday. Then the next day, July 19, is Tuesday, and so on. So the weekends in this period would be Sundays and Saturdays.\n\nLet me list the days of the week for each date. Let's start with July 17 (Sunday). Then:\n\nJuly 17: Sunday\nJuly 18: Monday\nJuly 19: Tuesday\nJuly 20: Wednesday\nJuly 21: Thursday\nJuly 22: Friday\nJuly 23: Saturday\nJuly 24: Sunday\nJuly 25: Monday\nJuly 26: Tuesday\nJuly 27: Wednesday\nJuly 28: Thursday\nJuly 29: Friday\nJuly 30: Saturday\nJuly 31: Sunday\n\nThen August 1: Monday\nAugust 2: Tuesday\nAugust 3: Wednesday\nAugust 4: Thursday\nAugust 5: Friday\nAugust 6: Saturday\nAugust 7: Sunday\nAugust 8: Monday\nAugust 9: Tuesday\nAugust 10: Wednesday\nAugust 11: Thursday\nAugust 12: Friday\nAugust 13: Saturday\nAugust 14: Sunday\nAugust 15: Monday\nAugust 16: Tuesday\nAugust 17: Wednesday\nAugust 18: Thursday\nAugust 19: Friday\nAugust 20: Saturday\nAugust 21: Sunday\nAugust 22: Monday\nAugust 23: Tuesday\n\nNow, let's count the number of Sundays and Saturdays in this period.\n\nFirst, in July:\n\nSundays: July 17, 24, 31. That's 3 Sundays.\n\nSaturdays: July 23, 30. That's 2 Saturdays.\n\nIn August:\n\nSaturdays: August 6, 13, 20. That's 3 Saturdays.\n\nSundays: August 7, 14, 21. That's 3 Sundays.\n\nSo total weekends: 3 (Sundays in July) + 2 (Saturdays in July) + 3 (Saturdays in August) + 3 (Sundays in August) = 3+2+3+3=11 weekends.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The period is from July 17 to August 23 inclusive. So August 23 is a Tuesday. So in August, the last day is Tuesday. So the Sundays in August would be August 7, 14, 21. That's three Sundays. The Saturdays in August would be August 6, 13, 20. That's three Saturdays. So that's correct.\n\nSo total weekends are 3+2+3+3=11. So total weekends are 11 days.\n\nSo total business days would be total days (38) minus weekends (11) = 27 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the weekends again. Let's list all the weekends in the period.\n\nSundays: July 17, 24, 31 (3 days)\nSaturdays: July 23, 30 (2 days)\nSaturdays in August: August 6, 13, 20 (3 days)\nSundays in August: August 7, 14, 21 (3 days)\nTotal: 3+2+3+3=11. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 38 total days minus 11 weekends equals 27 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from July 17 (Sunday), which is not a business day. Then July 18 (Monday) is a business day. Let's count each business day.\n\nJuly 18 (Mon), 19 (Tue), 20 (Wed), 21 (Thu), 22 (Fri) \u2013 that's 5 days.\n\nJuly 23 is Saturday (non-business), 24 Sunday (non-business). Then July 25 (Mon) is business. So July 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nJuly 30 (Sat), 31 (Sun) \u2013 non-business. Then August 1 (Mon) is business. August 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nAugust 6 (Sat), 7 (Sun) \u2013 non-business. August 8 (Mon) to August 12 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nAugust 13 (Sat), 14 (Sun) \u2013 non-business. August 15 (Mon) to August 19 (Fri) \u2013 5 days.\n\nAugust 20 (Sat), 21 (Sun) \u2013 non-business. August 22 (Mon), 23 (Tue) \u2013 2 days.\n\nSo adding up:\n\nJuly: 5 (18-22) + 5 (25-29) = 10\nAugust: 5 (1-5) + 5 (8-12) + 5 (15-19) + 2 (22-23) = 5+5+5+2=17\nTotal: 10 + 17 = 27. Yes, that matches. So the answer is 27.", "27"], [74, "Between Wednesday, May 18, 2022 and Friday, June 3, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Tuesday occur? Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many Tuesdays there are between Wednesday, May 18, 2022, and Friday, June 3, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out the dates and check each day.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days in that period and then divide by 7, but since the start and end days might not align perfectly, I need to check the exact days.\n\nLet me start by checking the first day, which is Wednesday, May 18, 2022. So that's a Wednesday. Then the next day is Thursday, May 19, and so on. The last day is Friday, June 3, 2022. So I need to count all the Tuesdays in this range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find out what day of the week May 18, 2022, was. Wait, the problem says that May 18 is a Wednesday. So that's given. So May 18 is Wednesday. Then May 19 is Thursday, May 20 is Friday, May 21 is Saturday, May 22 is Sunday, May 23 is Monday, May 24 is Tuesday. So the first Tuesday in this period is May 24, 2022.\n\nThen each week after that. Let me count the number of days from May 18 to June 3. Let's calculate the total days. May has 31 days. So from May 18 to May 31 is 14 days (including May 18). Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total days is 14 + 3 = 17 days. Wait, but wait, if May 18 is day 1, then May 19 is day 2, etc. So from May 18 to May 31 is 14 days (since 31 - 18 + 1 = 14). Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total is 14 + 3 = 17 days. So the period is 17 days long.\n\nNow, since the first day is Wednesday, May 18, and the last day is Friday, June 3. So the days of the week would cycle as follows. Let's list them out:\n\nMay 18: Wednesday\nMay 19: Thursday\nMay 20: Friday\nMay 21: Saturday\nMay 22: Sunday\nMay 23: Monday\nMay 24: Tuesday (first Tuesday)\nMay 25: Wednesday\nMay 26: Thursday\nMay 27: Friday\nMay 28: Saturday\nMay 29: Sunday\nMay 30: Monday\nMay 31: Tuesday (second Tuesday)\nJune 1: Wednesday\nJune 2: Thursday\nJune 3: Friday (last day)\n\nSo the Tuesdays are May 24 and May 31. That's two Tuesdays. Wait, but let me check again. Let me count each day step by step.\n\nStarting from May 18 (Wednesday):\n\n1. May 18: Wed\n2. May 19: Thu\n3. May 20: Fri\n4. May 21: Sat\n5. May 22: Sun\n6. May 23: Mon\n7. May 24: Tue (1st)\n8. May 25: Wed\n9. May 26: Thu\n10. May 27: Fri\n11. May 28: Sat\n12. May 29: Sun\n13. May 30: Mon\n14. May 31: Tue (2nd)\n15. June 1: Wed\n16. June 2: Thu\n17. June 3: Fri\n\nYes, that's 17 days. So the Tuesdays are on days 7 and 14, which are May 24 and May 31. So that's two Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer should be 2.", "2"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 24 to Friday, June 24, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Express your answer as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between April 24, 2022 (Sunday) and June 24, 2022 (Friday), including both dates. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates.\n\nApril 24, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think April 24, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check. Well, maybe I can count the days step by step.\n\nStarting from April 24 (Sunday), the next day is April 25 (Monday), then April 26 (Tuesday), April 27 (Wednesday), April 28 (Thursday), April 29 (Friday), April 30 (Saturday), May 1 (Sunday), and so on. Then May has 31 days, so May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, etc. June 1 is a Wednesday, and June 24 is a Friday.\n\nBut maybe I should calculate the total number of days between April 24 and June 24, inclusive. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, April has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30 is 30 - 24 + 1 = 7 days. Wait, but April 24 is included, so from April 24 to April 30 is 7 days. Then May has 31 days, so May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days would be 7 (April) + 31 (May) + 24 (June) = 62 days. Wait, but that's from April 24 to June 24 inclusive? Let me check again.\n\nWait, April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (including both ends). Then May has 31 days, so adding 31. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. So total days between April 24 and June 24 inclusive is 62 days.\n\nNow, out of these 62 days, how many are weekends? Weekends are Sundays and Saturdays. Let's count the number of Sundays and Saturdays in this period.\n\nStarting from April 24 (Sunday), the next Sunday is April 30 (since April 24 is Sunday, then April 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday? Wait, wait, no. Wait, April 24 is Sunday. Then April 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. So in April, the Sundays are April 24 and April 30? Wait, April 24 is Sunday, then the next Sunday is May 1. Wait, April 24 is Sunday, then April 25 is Monday, so April 30 is Saturday. So in April, there's only one Sunday (April 24) and one Saturday (April 30). Then May has 31 days. May 1 is Sunday, so May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 are Sundays. That's 5 Sundays. Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 are Saturdays. That's 5 Saturdays. Then June 1 is Wednesday. So June has 24 days. Let's check the weekends in June. June 1 is Wednesday, so the first weekend in June is June 5 (Sunday) and June 6 (Saturday). Then June 12, 19, 26 are Sundays. Then June 7, 14, 21, 28 are Saturdays. Wait, June 24 is Friday, so the last Saturday in June would be June 25? Wait, June 24 is Friday, so June 25 is Saturday. But since the end date is June 24, which is Friday, that Saturday (June 25) is not included. So in June, the Saturdays are June 6, 13, 20, 27. Wait, but June 27 is a Saturday. Then June 27 is included in the period? Wait, the end date is June 24. So June 27 is after June 24, so not included. So in June, the Saturdays would be June 6, 13, 20. That's three Saturdays. And Sundays in June would be June 5, 12, 19, 26. But June 26 is included in the period (since June 24 is the end date, but June 26 is after June 24, so no. Wait, June 24 is the end date. So June 24 is included. So June 24 is Friday. So the Sundays in June would be June 5, 12, 19, 26. But June 26 is after June 24, so only June 5, 12, 19 are Sundays in June. Wait, June 5 is a Sunday. Then June 12 is Sunday, June 19 is Sunday, June 26 is Sunday. But June 26 is after June 24, so only three Sundays in June. So total Sundays in the period: April 24, May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (May has 5 Sundays), and June 5, 12, 19 (three Sundays). So total Sundays: 1 (April) + 5 (May) + 3 (June) = 9 Sundays. Saturdays: April 30, May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (May has 5 Saturdays), and June 6, 13, 20 (three Saturdays). But June 30 is after June 24, so only up to June 20. So total Saturdays: 1 (April) + 5 (May) + 3 (June) = 9 Saturdays. Wait, but April 30 is Saturday, May 2 is Saturday, etc. So total weekends are 9 Sundays + 9 Saturdays = 18 days. So total weekdays would be total days (62) minus weekends (18) = 44 weekdays. Wait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks and days. Let's see. From April 24 (Sunday) to June 24 (Friday). Let's check how many weeks and days that is. April 24 is Sunday. Let's count the days. Let's see, April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (including both ends). Then May has 31 days, so May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. Now, if I divide 62 days into weeks, each week has 7 days. 62 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 6 days. So 8 weeks is 56 days, and 6 days remaining. In each week, there are 5 weekdays (Monday-Friday) and 2 weekends (Saturday and Sunday). So 8 weeks would have 8*5 = 40 weekdays. Then the remaining 6 days: April 24 is Sunday, so the next days are April 25 (Monday), 26 (Tuesday), 27 (Wednesday), 28 (Thursday), 29 (Friday), 30 (Saturday). Wait, but the remaining 6 days would be from April 30 (Saturday) to June 24 (Friday)? Wait, no. Wait, the total days are 62. If 8 weeks is 56 days, then the remaining 6 days would be the first 6 days of the period? Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Wait, the total days is 62. If I have 8 weeks (56 days), then the remaining 6 days would be the next 6 days after 56 days. But since the period starts on April 24 (Sunday), the first 56 days would be 8 weeks. Then the remaining 6 days would be from day 57 to day 62. Let me check what those days are. April 24 is day 1 (Sunday). Then day 56 would be April 24 + 55 days. Let me calculate that. April has 30 days, so April 24 + 30 days is May 24. Then May has 31 days, so May 24 + 31 days is June 24. Wait, that's 30 + 31 = 61 days. Wait, but that's from April 24 to May 24 (30 days) and then May 24 to June 24 is 31 days. Wait, that's 61 days. But the total is 62 days. So maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe the remaining 6 days after 56 days would be from April 24 + 56 days. Let me calculate that. April 24 + 56 days. April has 30 days, so 30 days from April 24 is May 24. Then 56 days is 30 + 26 days. So May 24 + 26 days is June 24 (since May has 31 days, so May 24 + 7 days is May 31, then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So May 24 + 26 days is June 24. So day 56 is June 24. Wait, but that would mean that the 56 days would end on June 24. But the total days are 62, so that can't be. Maybe my approach is wrong here. Let me try again. Maybe it's easier to count the number of weekends directly. Let's go back to the previous count. I had 9 Sundays and 9 Saturdays, totaling 18 weekend days. So 62 total days minus 18 weekend days equals 44 weekdays. But let me check again. Let's list the dates:\n\nApril 24 (Sunday) is included. Then April 25 (Monday), 26 (Tuesday), 27 (Wednesday), 28 (Thursday), 29 (Friday), 30 (Saturday). So in April, there are 7 days. The weekends here are April 24 (Sunday) and April 30 (Saturday). So 2 weekend days in April.\n\nThen May has 31 days. May 1 is Sunday. So Sundays in May are May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (5 Sundays). Saturdays in May are May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5 Saturdays). So 5 + 5 = 10 weekend days in May.\n\nJune has 24 days. June 1 is Wednesday. So the first weekend in June is June 5 (Sunday) and June 6 (Saturday). Then June 12 (Sunday), 19 (Sunday), 26 (Sunday). But June 26 is after June 24, so only June 5, 12, 19 are Sundays. Saturdays in June are June 6, 13, 20, 27. But June 27 is after June 24, so only June 6, 13, 20. So that's 3 Saturdays. So in June, 3 + 3 = 6 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekend days: April (2) + May (10) + June (6) = 18. So 18 weekend days. Total days 62. So 62 - 18 = 44 weekdays. That seems correct.

So two days ago would be the day before Tuesday, which is Monday. Wait, let me double-check that.

Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. Today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022. I need to find out what day of the week it was 56 days ago. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I know that weeks have 7 days, so maybe I can divide 56 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that calculation. 56 divided by 7 is 8. Oh, so 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. That means 56 days ago would be the same day of the week as today, right? Because each week cycles every 7 days. So if today is Tuesday, then 7 days ago was also Tuesday, 14 days ago another Tuesday, and so on. So 56 days ago, which is 8 weeks back, should also be a Tuesday.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me count backwards step by step to make sure. Let's start from today, February 8, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Subtract 7 days: February 1st, 2022, which is also a Tuesday. Subtract another 7 days: January 25, 2022, Tuesday again. Then January 18, 2022, Tuesday. January 11, 2022, Tuesday. January 4, 2022, Tuesday. December 28, 2022, Tuesday. Wait, hold on, that's only 7 weeks back. Wait, no, each subtraction of 7 days is one week. So 7 days ago is 1 week, 14 days ago is 2 weeks, etc. So 56 days is 8 weeks. So 8 weeks before February 8, 2022, would be February 8 minus 56 days. Let me check the actual date. \n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual calendar. But since I don't have a calendar here, maybe I can calculate the date. Let's see. February 8 minus 56 days. Let's break it down. February has 28 days in 2022 (since 2022 is not a leap year). So if I subtract 28 days from February 8, that would take me to January 10, 2022. Then subtract another 28 days: December 12, 2021. Then another 28 days: November 14, 2021. Wait, that's 28 days three times, which is 84 days. Wait, no, that's too much. Wait, 56 days is 28 + 28. So subtract 28 days from February 8: January 10, 2022. Then subtract another 28 days: December 12, 2021. Wait, that's 56 days. So December 12, 2021. Now, what day of the week was that?\n\nBut since I know that February 8, 2022, is a Tuesday, and 56 days ago is 8 weeks, which is exactly 56 days. So if I go back 8 weeks, the day of the week should be the same. Therefore, December 12, 2021, should also be a Tuesday. But maybe I should check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the number of days in each month. Let's count backwards from February 8, 2022.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use modular arithmetic. Since 56 divided by 7 is 8 with no remainder, so 56 days ago is the same day of the week. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the days? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're going back 56 days, which is exactly 8 weeks, the day of the week should be the same. So regardless of the actual dates, the day of the week would be Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Tell me whether 1999 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1999 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 1999. First, divide 1999 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 499 is 1996, so 1999 minus 1996 is 3. That means 1999 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3. So it's not divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that division. Let me add 4 to 1996: 1996 + 4 is 2000. So 1999 is one year before 2000, which is a leap year. But since 1999 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. \n\nAlso, 1999 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So even if it were divisible by 4, which it isn't, the century year check would still be needed.

November 1 is a Tuesday (since October 25 is a Tuesday, adding 7 days gets to November 1). Then November 8, 15. But the end date is November 15, which is included. So that's three Tuesdays in November.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me count each month step by step.\n\nSeptember: 20, 27. That's two Tuesdays.\n\nOctober: 4, 11, 18, 25. Four Tuesdays.\n\nNovember: 1, 8, 15. Three Tuesdays.\n\nSo total is 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 Tuesdays. But wait, let me make sure that all these dates are within the given range. The start date is September 18, so September 20 is after that. The end date is November 15. So all the Tuesdays listed are within the range. So 2 + 4 + 3 = 9. But wait, let me check if there's any mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but since the start and end days are specific, maybe that's not straightforward. But let's try.\n\nFirst, let's check the number of days from September 18 to November 15 inclusive. Let's calculate the total days.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. From September 18 to September 30 is 13 days (including September 18). Then October has 31 days, and November 1 to November 15 is 15 days. So total days is 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. Wait, but that's if we include both start and end dates. Wait, but if you count from September 18 to September 30 inclusive, that's 30 - 18 + 1 = 13 days. Then October is 31 days, and November 1-15 is 15 days. So total is 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. So 59 days in total.\n\nNow, if there are 59 days, then the number of Tuesdays would be 59 divided by 7, rounded up or down depending on the starting day. But since the first day is a Sunday, September 18 is Sunday. So the first Tuesday is September 20, which is day 2 (since day 0 is Sunday, day 1 is Monday, day 2 is Tuesday). Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of how many weeks and extra days there are.\n\nAlternatively, since the total days are 59, and 59 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 3 days. So 8 weeks would have 8 Tuesdays, and then 3 days. Since the first day is Sunday, the next three days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So that would add one more Tuesday. So total of 8 + 1 = 9 Tuesdays. Which matches the previous count. So that seems to confirm that the answer is 9.\n\nBut let me check again with the individual dates. Let's list all the Tuesdays:\n\nSeptember: 20, 27 (2)\nOctober: 4, 11, 18, 25 (4)\nNovember: 1, 8, 15 (3)\nTotal: 2+4+3=9. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 9.", "9"], [74, "Determine the day of the month for the last Saturday in November 2022. Give the count numerically.

If it doesn't exist, I should answer -1. Wait, but November has 30 days, so there must be a Saturday. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Maybe I can check that. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then counting the days:\n\nNovember 1 is Tuesday. So the next days would be:\n\n- 1: Tuesday\n- 2: Wednesday\n- 3: Thursday\n- 4: Friday\n- 5: Saturday. So the first Saturday is the 5th.\n\nThen the next Saturdays would be 12th, 19th, and 26th. Then the next one would be December 3rd, which is outside of November. So the last Saturday in November would be the 26th. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, if November 1 is Tuesday, then adding 4 days gets to Saturday the 5th. Then each week after that. So 5 + 7 = 12, 12 +7=19, 19+7=26. Then 26 +7=33, which is beyond 30. So yes, the last Saturday is the 26th. Therefore, the answer should be 26.", "26"], [74, "In a year where Monday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 3.

I need to figure out what day of the week that falls on.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 3rd. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I'll assume it's a common year with 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days into March.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to March 3rd would be 31 (January) - 1 (since we start on day 1) + 28 (February) + 3 (March) = 31 -1 is 30, plus 28 is 58, plus 3 is 61 days. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, etc. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days after February 28th, so 59 + 3 = 62 days total from January 1st. Wait, but if January 1st is day 1, then January 1st is day 1, January 2nd is day 2, so March 3rd would be day 31 (end of January) + 28 (February) + 3 (March) = 62 days. So March 3rd is day 62.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Monday, I need to find what day of the week day 62 is. Since each week has 7 days, I can divide 62 by 7 and find the remainder. 7*8=56, so 62-56=6. So the remainder is 6. That means 6 days after Monday. Let's count: Monday (0), Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Saturday (5), Sunday (6). So day 62 would be Sunday. Wait, but wait, if day 1 is Monday, then day 1 is Monday, day 2 Tuesday, ..., day 7 is Sunday. Then day 8 is Monday again. So the remainder when divided by 7 gives the number of days after Monday. So 62 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Monday is Sunday. Therefore, March 3rd would be a Sunday.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days into March, so 59 + 3 = 62 days. So yes, 62 days from January 1st. 62 divided by 7 is 8 weeks (56 days) and 6 days. So 6 days after Monday is Sunday.

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the dates involved. Let me check the dates. The start date is October 11, 2022, which is a Tuesday. The end date is October 20, 2022, which is a Thursday. \n\nNow, I need to list all the dates from October 11 to October 20 and count the weekdays. Let me start by listing each day:\n\nOctober 11: Tuesday (weekday)\nOctober 12: Wednesday (weekday)\nOctober 13: Thursday (weekday)\nOctober 14: Friday (weekday)\nOctober 15: Saturday (weekend)\nOctober 16: Sunday (weekend)\nOctober 17: Monday (weekday)\nOctober 18: Tuesday (weekday)\nOctober 19: Wednesday (weekday)\nOctober 20: Thursday (weekday)\n\nNow, let's count the weekdays.

Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any. From 11 to 20, that's 10 days total. The weekends are 15 and 16, so two days. So 10 - 2 = 8 weekdays. That matches.

The problem is: In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, what day of the week is March 11th? And I need to answer with the full weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 11th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is the starting point). Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think we can assume it's a common year, so 28 days. Then March 11th is 11 days into March.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. If January 1st is Wednesday, then January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So to find March 11th, I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 11th, then find the day of the week by adding that number modulo 7.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 11th is 11 days after February 28th. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 69 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is day 0, January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31, and February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59, March 11th is day 59 + 10 = day 69. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 69 days.\n\nNow, since each week has 7 days, we can find 69 divided by 7. Let's calculate 69 divided by 7. 7*9=63, 69-63=6. So 69 days is 9 weeks and 6 days. So starting from Wednesday (January 1st), adding 6 days would be the day of the week for March 11th.\n\nSo Wednesday + 6 days. Let's count: Wednesday (0), Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4), Monday (5), Tuesday (6). So adding 6 days to Wednesday would be Tuesday. Wait, but wait. Wait, if January 1st is Wednesday, then adding 1 day is Thursday, 2 days is Friday, etc. So 6 days later would be Tuesday. But wait, that would mean March 11th is Tuesday? But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me recount. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 11th is 11 days. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 30 + 28 + 11 = 69 days. Yes, that's correct. 69 days later.\n\nNow, 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks (63 days) and 6 days. So 6 days after Wednesday. Let's count:\n\nWednesday (0) + 1 = Thursday (1)\n+2 = Friday (2)\n+3 = Saturday (3)\n+4 = Sunday (4)\n+5 = Monday (5)\n+6 = Tuesday (6)\n\nSo March 11th would be a Tuesday. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because sometimes when you count days, you have to be careful whether you include the starting day or not. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Wednesday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Wednesday. Then January 8th is also Wednesday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Wednesday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is Wednesday. Then March 12th is Wednesday. So March 11th is two days before March 12th, which is Wednesday. So March 11th would be Monday? Wait, that contradicts the previous answer. Now I'm confused.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Which one is correct? Let me check again.\n\nIf March 5th is Wednesday, then March 6th is Thursday, March 7th is Friday, March 8th is Saturday, March 9th is Sunday, March 10th is Monday, March 11th is Tuesday. Wait, that would be Tuesday. But according to the previous step-by-step, March 5th is Wednesday. So March 11th is 6 days later. So Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But in the other approach, when I counted the days from January 1st to March 11th as 69 days, which is 9 weeks and 6 days, so adding 6 days to Wednesday gives Tuesday. So that's consistent. But then why did I think March 5th is Wednesday? Let me check that again.\n\nIf January 1st is Wednesday, then January 8th is Wednesday (7 days later). Then January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Wednesday (29 + 5 = 34 days later). Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is Wednesday (26 + 5 = 31 days later). Wait, but 26 days from February 26th is March 5th? Wait, February has 28 days, so February 26th plus 28 days is March 26th. Wait, no. Wait, if February 26th is a Wednesday, then adding 5 days would be March 3rd. Wait, maybe I messed up the dates here.\n\nLet me try again. Let's list the dates step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 8th: Wednesday (7 days later).\n\nJanuary 15th: Wednesday (14 days later).\n\nJanuary 22nd: Wednesday (21 days later).\n\nJanuary 29th: Wednesday (28 days later).\n\nThen February 5th is 28 + 5 = 33 days later. Wait, but January has 31 days, so from January 1st to February 5th is 31 (January) + 5 (February) - 1 = 35 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 29th is day 28. Then February 1st is day 29. So February 5th is day 29 + 4 = day 33. So day 33 is February 5th. Then February 5th is Wednesday. Then February 12th is day 33 + 7 = day 40, which is also Wednesday. February 19th is day 47, Wednesday. February 26th is day 54, Wednesday. Then March 5th is day 54 + 5 = day 59. So March 5th is Wednesday. Then March 6th is Thursday, March 7th is Friday, March 8th is Saturday, March 9th is Sunday, March 10th is Monday, March 11th is Tuesday. So that's Tuesday. So that's consistent with the first calculation. So March 11th is Tuesday. But earlier when I thought March 5th is Wednesday, and then adding 6 days to get to March 11th, that's correct. So why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought March 5th is Wednesday, and then March 11th is 6 days later, which is Tuesday. So that's correct.\n\nBut then why did I think there was a contradiction? Because I must have made a mistake in the second approach. So the answer should be Tuesday. But wait, let me check with another method. Let's use the total days.\n\nTotal days from January 1st to March 11th is 69 days. 69 divided by 7 is 9*7=63, remainder 6. So 6 days after Wednesday is Tuesday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Determine the day of the month for the fourth Sunday in December 2022.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the Sundays would be on the 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 24th. Wait, let me count again. If December 1 is a Thursday, then the next Sunday would be the 3rd (since 1 is Thursday, 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, Thursday is the 1st. Then Friday is 2nd, Saturday 3rd, Sunday 4th?

I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yeah, that makes sense. So if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then each subsequent day adds one day of the week.\n\nNow, October 1st is 274 days after January 1st. Wait, how do I calculate that? Let me break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since we start counting from the 1st). Then February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year), March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and then October 1st. Let me add those up step by step.\n\nFrom January 1 to October 1:\n\nJanuary: 31 days, but since we start on January 1, the days from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. But if we're calculating the number of days from January 1 to October 1, we need to count each month's days up to September. Wait, maybe I should count the number of days from January 1 to October 1. Let's do that:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (but since we start on Jan 1, the days from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. But if we're going from Jan 1 to Oct 1, we need to add the days of each month up to September. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of days between Jan 1 and Oct 1. Let me list the months:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 days (2022 is not a leap year)\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\n\nSo adding those up from January to September:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 30 (Jun) = 181\n181 + 31 (Jul) = 212\n212 + 31 (Aug) = 243\n243 + 30 (Sep) = 273 days.\n\nSo from January 1 to September 30 is 273 days. Then October 1 is the next day, so 274 days after January 1. \n\nNow, since January 1 is a Sunday, adding 274 days to that. But since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can divide 274 by 7 and find the remainder. That will tell me how many days ahead the date is from Sunday.\n\nLet me calculate 274 divided by 7. 7*39 is 273, so 274 is 273 +1. So the remainder is 1. That means 274 days later is 1 day after Sunday, which is Monday. Wait, but wait, if January 1 is Sunday, then adding 1 day would be Monday. So October 1st would be a Monday? But I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think of a known date. For example, I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm confusing with another year. Wait, I think I need to verify this. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then let's count the days step by step. For example, January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday again. So each week is 7 days. So if I can find how many weeks and days are in 274 days, that would help. \n\n274 divided by 7 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So 39 weeks later is the same day, Sunday, plus 1 day is Monday. So October 1st would be a Monday. But I think I might be wrong here. Wait, maybe I should check with another approach. \n\nAlternatively, I can check online or use a calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days from January 1 to October 1. Let me recount the months again. \n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\n\nAdding them up:\n\n31 + 28 = 59\n59 + 31 = 90\n90 + 30 = 120\n120 + 31 = 151\n151 + 30 = 181\n181 + 31 = 212\n212 + 31 = 243\n243 + 30 = 273. \n\nYes, that's correct. So from January 1 to September 30 is 273 days. Then October 1 is 274 days after January 1. So 274 divided by 7 is 39 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Sunday would be Monday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 is a Monday. \n\nBut wait, I think I might be wrong because I remember that October 1, 2022 was actually a Saturday. Wait, maybe I confused the year. Let me think again. Wait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Sunday is incorrect. Let me check that. \n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me verify January 1, 2022. If I recall, January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. That seems correct. So if that's the case, then adding 274 days would be 39 weeks and 1 day, so Sunday + 1 day is Monday. \n\nBut maybe I should check another date. For example, let's take a known date in 2022. For example, July 4, 2022. I think July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if July 4 is a Monday, then let's see. From January 1 to July 4. Let's calculate that. \n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 4. So adding up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 30 (Jun) = 181\n181 + 4 (Jul) = 185 days. \n\nSo 185 days from January 1. 185 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 3 days. So 26 weeks later is Sunday, plus 3 days is Wednesday. But if July 4 is a Monday, that contradicts. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong. \n\nWait, this suggests that my calculation is wrong. So maybe January 1, 2022 is not a Sunday. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let me check the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, if that's the case, then maybe my previous calculation is wrong. Let me try to work backward. \n\nIf October 1 is a Saturday, then September 30 is a Friday. Let's count the days from September 30 to October 1. That's one day. So if September 30 is Friday, then October 1 is Saturday. \n\nNow, let's count the days from January 1 to September 30. If September 30 is 273 days after January 1, then adding 273 days to January 1 (Sunday) would be September 30. So 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks, so 39 weeks later is the same day, Sunday. So September 30 would be a Sunday. But that contradicts the previous statement that September 30 is a Friday. Therefore, there's a mistake here. \n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Sunday is incorrect. So where did I go wrong? \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days from January 1 to September 30. Let me recount. \n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\n\nAdding them up:\n\n31 + 28 = 59\n59 + 31 = 90\n90 + 30 = 120\n120 + 31 = 151\n151 + 30 = 181\n181 + 31 = 212\n212 + 31 = 243\n243 + 30 = 273. \n\nYes, that's correct. So September 30 is 273 days after January 1. If that's the case, then if January 1 is a Sunday, September 30 would be a Sunday. But if October 1 is a Saturday, then September 30 is a Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Sunday must be wrong. \n\nSo where is the error? Let me check the day of the week for January 1, 2022. Maybe I confused it with another year. Let me think. I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year), so 2021 would start on a Thursday (since 366 days is 52 weeks and 2 days). So January 1, 2021 was a Thursday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day, so January 1, 2022 would be a Friday. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. \n\nSo if January 1, 2021 was a Thursday, then adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make January 1, 2022 a Friday. So that's where I went wrong earlier. I thought it was Sunday, but it's actually Friday. \n\nSo that changes everything. So if January 1, 2022 is a Friday, then adding 274 days (which is 39 weeks and 1 day) would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. That aligns with the previous thought that October 1 was a Saturday. \n\nSo the mistake was in the initial assumption about January 1, 2022. So the correct day is Saturday. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "Count forward 80 days from Wednesday, July 6, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 80 days after Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Hmm, first, I should figure out the date 80 days later. Then, determine the weekday.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than counting each day. Since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can divide 80 by 7 and find the remainder. That remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is.\n\nSo 80 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 11 is 77, which leaves a remainder of 3. So 80 days later is 3 days after Wednesday. Let me check that again. 7*11=77, 80-77=3. Yes, remainder 3.\n\nSo Wednesday plus 3 days. Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday. So the answer should be Saturday? Wait, but maybe I should verify this by actually counting the days or checking a calendar. Because sometimes when you cross months or leap years, the days might not align as expected. But 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days.\n\nLet me try to count the days step by step. Starting from July 6, 2022. Let's add 7 days first to get to July 13, which is also a Wednesday. Then adding another 7 days would be July 20, another Wednesday. Then July 27, August 3, August 10, August 17, August 24, August 31. Wait, but 80 days is more than 11 weeks (77 days). So 80 days is 11 weeks and 3 days. So adding 11 weeks (77 days) to July 6, 2022, would bring me to July 6 + 77 days. Let me check that.\n\nJuly has 31 days. July 6 plus 7 days is July 13, then 14 days is July 20, 21 days July 27, 28 days August 3. So 28 days later is August 3, 2022. Then adding 7 more weeks (another 28 days) would be August 3 + 28 days = August 31, 2022. Wait, but that's 28 + 28 = 56 days from July 6. Wait, no. Wait, 7 days is one week. So 77 days is 11 weeks. So July 6 plus 77 days would be July 6 + 7*11 = July 6 + 77 days. Let me calculate that.\n\nJuly has 31 days. July 6 plus 25 days would be July 31 (since 31-6=25). Then adding 77 days would be 25 days in July, then 28 days in August (July 31 + 28 days is August 28, 2022). Wait, that's 25 + 28 = 53 days. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to calculate manually. Let's break down the days:\n\nStarting from July 6, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count the days step by step.\n\nFirst, July has 31 days. So from July 6 to July 31 is 31 - 6 = 25 days. So adding 25 days to July 6 would be July 31. Then, adding 28 days (which is 4 weeks) would take me to August 28, 2022. So 25 + 28 = 53 days. Then, adding another 28 days (another 4 weeks) would be September 25, 2022. Wait, but 53 + 28 = 81 days. That's over 80. So 80 days would be 53 days (July 6 to August 28) minus 1 day, which is August 27, 2022. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, July 6 + 25 days is July 31. Then adding 28 days (July 31 + 28 days is August 28). So that's 25 + 28 = 53 days. Then adding another 27 days (since 80 - 53 = 27) would take me to August 28 + 27 days. August has 31 days, so August 28 + 27 days is September 24, 2022? Wait, August 28 + 2 days is August 30, then 3 days is August 31, then 24 days in September. Wait, that's not right. Let me count again.\n\nWait, August 28 + 27 days. August has 31 days, so from August 28 to August 31 is 3 days. Then September has 30 days. So 27 days after August 28 is 3 days in August (August 28, 29, 30, 31) and then 24 days in September. So September 24, 2022. So that's 53 + 27 = 80 days. So the date is September 24, 2022. Now, what day of the week is that?\n\nBut wait, the original date was Wednesday, July 6. Let me check the days again. If July 6 is a Wednesday, then July 13 is Wednesday (7 days later), July 20, 27, August 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, September 7, 14, 21, 28. So September 28 is a Wednesday. Then September 24 would be 4 days before that. So September 24 is a Saturday? Because September 28 is Wednesday. So September 27 is Tuesday, 26 is Monday, 25 is Sunday, 24 is Saturday. So that would mean September 24 is a Saturday. Which matches the earlier calculation of adding 3 days to Wednesday (Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday). So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "If a meeting is scheduled on the second Thursday of May 2022, on which day of the month does it occur?

I need to find out on which date the second Thursday of May 2022 falls. Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first week of May would start on Sunday, May 1. So the first Thursday would be May 4th, right? Because May 1 is Sunday, so adding three days gets to Thursday. Then the second Thursday would be the next week, so May 11th. Wait, but wait, maybe I should check again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nMay 1, 2022: Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday? Wait, that would mean the first Thursday is May 5th. Wait, maybe I messed up the days. Let me think again. If May 1 is Sunday, then:\n\nMay 1: Sunday\nMay 2: Monday\nMay 3: Tuesday\nMay 4: Wednesday\nMay 5: Thursday. Oh right! So the first Thursday is May 5th. Then the second Thursday would be the next week, which is May 12th. Wait, but wait, maybe I need to check the actual calendar for May 2022. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check online... Wait, I can't actually browse, but I can recall. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May has 31 days. Let me think again. If May 5 is the first Thursday, then adding 7 days would be May 12, which is the second Thursday. Then May 19 would be the third, and May 26 the fourth. But wait, the question is about the second Thursday. So that would be May 12th. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again. Wait, I think I might have confused the days. Let me try another approach. Let's check what day May 1, 2022, was. I think it was a Sunday. Let me confirm. For example, May 1, 2022, was indeed a Sunday. So May 1 (Sunday), May 2 (Monday), May 3 (Tuesday), May 4 (Wednesday), May 5 (Thursday). So first Thursday is May 5. Then the second Thursday is May 12. So the answer should be 12. But wait, maybe I should check if there's a possibility that the first Thursday is in the first week. Wait, the first Thursday of the month is the first occurrence of Thursday in May.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate this. Maybe I can use some known dates and work from there. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, I can use a known date that I'm certain about. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 15, 2022 is a specific date. Let me try to count the days from a known date. Let's say I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, how did I get that? Maybe I can check by counting weeks. Let me think. If I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday, then adding 14 days (which is two weeks) would bring me to June 15, 2022. So June 15 would be a Wednesday as well. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the days of the week. If I can find a date in June 2022 that I know the day of the week, then I can count forward or backward. For example, I remember that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me confirm that. If June 1 is Wednesday, then June 8 is also Wednesday, June 15 would be another Wednesday. So that would make June 15, 2022 a Wednesday. But I need to be sure that June 1, 2022 was indeed a Wednesday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then June 30 would be a Thursday. Then June 15 would be 15 days before July 1. Let's count backwards. June 15 to June 30 is 15 days. Wait, no, June 15 to June 30 is 15 days? Wait, June 15 plus 15 days is June 30. So if June 30 is Thursday, then June 15 would be 15 days earlier. Let's count backwards. Each week is 7 days, so 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks (14 days) and 1 day. So going back 14 days from June 30 would be June 16, which is Thursday. Then June 15 would be the day before, which is Wednesday. So that matches the previous conclusion. Therefore, June 15, 2022 was a Wednesday. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that July 1, 2022 was indeed a Friday. Let me think. If I know that June 15 is Wednesday, then June 16 is Thursday, June 23 is Wednesday, June 30 is Wednesday. Wait, that would mean July 1 is Thursday. But that contradicts my previous thought. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.\n\nIf June 15 is Wednesday, then June 16 is Thursday. Adding 7 days, June 23 is Wednesday. Then June 30 is Wednesday. So July 1 would be Thursday. But I thought earlier that July 1 was Friday. That's conflicting. So where is the error here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption that June 1 was Wednesday is wrong. Let me try another approach. Let's use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me count the days from January 1 to June 15. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Sunday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31 days, April 30, May 31, and June 15. Let's calculate the total days from January 1 to June 15.\n\nJanuary: 31 days (from Jan 1 to Jan 31)\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 31 days\nJune: 15 days (up to June 15)\n\nTotal days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 = Let's add them step by step.\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 15 (June) = 166 days.\n\nSo from January 1, 2022 (Sunday) to June 15, 2022 is 166 days. Now, to find the day of the week, we can divide 166 by 7 and find the remainder. Because each week has 7 days, the remainder will tell us how many days ahead the date is from Sunday.\n\n166 divided by 7 is 23 weeks and 5 days (since 23*7=161, 166-161=5). So 5 days after Sunday is Friday. Wait, that would mean June 15, 2022 is a Friday? But that contradicts my previous conclusion. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again. January 1 to June 15. Let's count the days again:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February is 28 days, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 15. So adding those:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 15 (June) = 166. That's correct. So 166 days from January 1, 2022 (Sunday). 166 divided by 7 is 23 weeks and 5 days. So 5 days after Sunday is Friday. Therefore, June 15, 2022 would be a Friday. But earlier, when I thought that June 30 was Wednesday, that would mean July 1 is Thursday, which would make June 15 a Wednesday. But that's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is wrong. Let me check that. I think I might have confused the year. Wait, 2022: January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, no, I think I need to verify that. Wait, I think I might have mixed up the years. Let me think. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, that's correct. So if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then my previous calculation was wrong. So that changes things. So if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then adding 166 days would be 166 days later. Let's recalculate.\n\nSo 166 days from Saturday. 166 divided by 7 is 23 weeks and 5 days. So 5 days after Saturday is Thursday. Wait, Saturday + 1 day is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday, +5 is Thursday. So June 15, 2022 would be a Thursday? But that contradicts the previous conclusion. Now I'm really confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is Monday, then June 30 would be a Sunday. Then June 15 would be 15 days before June 30. Let's count backwards. June 30 is Sunday. June 23 is Sunday, June 16 is Sunday, June 9 is Sunday, June 2 is Sunday. Then June 1 is Saturday. Wait, that would mean June 1 is Saturday. Then June 15 is 14 days later, which is two weeks, so also Saturday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to find a different approach. Let me check the actual date. Wait, I think I remember that June 15, 2022 was a Wednesday. But according to the calculation with January 1 being Saturday, 166 days later would be Thursday. But that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that June 15, 2022 is the same as June 15, 2023, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that June 15, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think of another way. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, if March 1 is Tuesday, then March 8 is Tuesday, March 15 is Tuesday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 29 is Tuesday. Then April 5 is Tuesday. April 12 is Tuesday, April 19 is Tuesday, April 26 is Tuesday. May 3 is Tuesday, May 10 is Tuesday, May 17 is Tuesday, May 24 is Tuesday, May 31 is Tuesday. Then June 7 is Tuesday, June 14 is Tuesday, so June 15 is Wednesday. That seems to align with the previous conclusion. So if March 1 is Tuesday, then June 15 is Wednesday. \n\nBut how do I know that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday? Let me check. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. January has 31 days, so January 31 is a Tuesday (since 31 days later is 31 mod 7 = 3 days after Saturday, which is Tuesday). Then February has 28 days, which is 4 weeks, so February 28 is also a Tuesday. March 1 is the next day, which is Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts the previous statement. So if March 1 is Wednesday, then my previous calculation that June 15 is Wednesday would be correct. But earlier, when I calculated from January 1 being Saturday, adding 166 days, which is 23 weeks and 5 days, that would be Saturday + 5 days = Thursday. But that's conflicting. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Where is the mistake? Let me recheck the calculation. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday, February 12 is Saturday, February 19 is Saturday, February 26 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday. March 1 is the day before March 5, which is Friday. Wait, that would mean March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is Friday, March 15 is Friday, March 22 is Friday, March 29 is Friday. April 5 is Friday, April 12 is Friday, April 19 is Friday, April 26 is Friday. May 3 is Friday, May 10 is Friday, May 17 is Friday, May 24 is Friday, May 31 is Friday. June 7 is Friday, June 14 is Friday, so June 15 is Saturday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion. \n\nThis is very confusing. I think I need to find a reliable way to check. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 15, 2022 is a Wednesday. But how? \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that I know that June 15, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, but I need to confirm. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. If July 1 is Friday, then June 30 is Thursday. Then June 23 is Thursday, June 16 is Thursday, June 9 is Thursday, June 2 is Thursday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 8 is Wednesday, June 15 is Wednesday. That would make June 15 a Wednesday. \n\nBut earlier, when I calculated from January 1 being Saturday, adding 166 days, I thought it was Thursday. But that must be wrong. Let me check that again. If January 1 is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15 is Saturday, 22 is Saturday, 29 is Saturday. February 5 is Saturday, 12 is Saturday, 19 is Saturday, 26 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday. March 1 is Friday. March 8 is Friday, 15 is Friday, 22 is Friday, 29 is Friday. April 5 is Friday, 12 is Friday, 19 is Friday, 26 is Friday. May 3 is Friday, 10 is Friday, 17 is Friday, 24 is Friday, 31 is Friday. June 7 is Friday, 14 is Friday, 21 is Friday, 28 is Friday. July 5 is Friday. So July 1 is Thursday. Wait, that contradicts the previous statement that July 1 is Friday. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. I think the correct way is to use the fact that June 15, 2022 is a Wednesday. Because when I counted from March 1 being Friday, then June 15 is Wednesday. But I need to resolve the discrepancy with the January 1 calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. I think I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But if that's the case, then the calculation of 166 days later would be 166 mod 7 = 5, so Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. But that contradicts the other method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between January 1 and June 15. Let me recalculate that. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31, April 30, May 31, and June 15. So total days from January 1 to June 15 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 15 (June) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+31=151, 151+15=166. That's correct. So 166 days. \n\nIf January 1 is Saturday, then 166 days later is 166 mod 7. 7*23=161, 166-161=5. So 5 days after Saturday is Thursday. So June 15 would be Thursday. But according to the other method, it's Wednesday. \n\nThis is a contradiction. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the March 1 calculation again. If January 1 is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. January 8 is Saturday, 15 is Saturday, 22 is Saturday, 29 is Saturday. February 5 is Saturday, 12 is Saturday, 19 is Saturday, 26 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday. So March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is Friday, 15 is Friday, 22 is Friday, 29 is Friday. April 5 is Friday, 12 is Friday, 19 is Friday, 26 is Friday. May 3 is Friday, 10 is Friday, 17 is Friday, 24 is Friday, 31 is Friday. June 7 is Friday, 14 is Friday, 21 is Friday, 28 is Friday. July 5 is Friday. So July 1 is Thursday. Therefore, June 15 is Friday. Wait, but earlier I thought June 15 was Wednesday. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. If June 15 is Friday, then that would mean that the previous calculation where I thought June 15 was Wednesday was wrong. But how? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the March 1 calculation. Let me check again. If March 1 is Friday, then March 8 is Friday, March 15 is Friday, March 22 is Friday, March 29 is Friday. April 5 is Friday, April"]]}
