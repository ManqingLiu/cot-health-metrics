Give the count numerically. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the first Wednesday of May 2022. I need to figure out which date that is. Hmm, I should start by recalling what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that again. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or some method to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if I know the day of the week for a specific date, I can count forward. Let's try to remember. For example, if May 1 is a Sunday, then May 2 is a Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday. So that would make the first Wednesday the 4th. But wait, is that correct? Wait, if May 1 is a Sunday, then the first Wednesday would be the 4th. But I need to confirm if May 1, 2022, was indeed a Sunday. Let me think. Wait, I think I might be wrong here. Maybe I should check a calendar. But since I can't actually look it up, I need to rely on my memory or some calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me recall that. So January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then, I can count the number of days in each month up to May. January has 31 days, February 28 (since 2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, and then May. So from January 1 to May 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) = 31+28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120 days. So May 1 is 120 days after January 1. Since January 1 is a Sunday, adding 120 days. Let's calculate 120 divided by 7. 7*17 is 119, so 120 days is 17 weeks and 1 day. So May 1 would be a Sunday + 1 day = Monday? Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1 is a Sunday, then adding 1 day is Monday (Jan 2), 2 days is Tuesday (Jan 3), etc. So 120 days later would be 120 mod 7. 120 divided by 7 is 17*7=119, remainder 1. So 120 days later is 1 day after Sunday, which is Monday. So May 1, 2022, was a Monday. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So if May 1 is a Monday, then the first Wednesday would be May 3. Because May 1 is Monday, May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday is the 3rd. But wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the actual calendar. Wait, I think I remember that May 2022 started on a Monday. So May 1 is Monday, May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 is Wednesday. Therefore, the first Wednesday is the 3rd. But I need to confirm this. Alternatively, maybe I can check the actual date. Wait, I think that May 3, 2022, was a Wednesday. Let me think. For example, if I know that May 1 is a Monday, then May 3 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday would be the 3rd. Therefore, the answer should be 3. But I need to make sure that May 1 is indeed a Monday. Let me check again. January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then, adding 31 days (January) brings us to February 1, which is a Sunday (since 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days, so Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is Sunday, then January 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 31 is 2 days after January 29, which is Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. So February 1, 2022, is a Wednesday. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days later. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so February 28 is also a Wednesday. Then March 1 is a Thursday. March has 31 days, so March 1 is Thursday, March 8 is Thursday, March 15, 22, 29. Then March 31 is 2 days after March 29 (Thursday + 2 days is Saturday). So April 1 is a Sunday. April has 30 days, so April 1 is Sunday, April 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. Then May 1 is the next day, which is Monday. So yes, May 1 is a Monday. Therefore, the first Wednesday is May 3. So the answer should be 3. Therefore, the first Wednesday of May 2022 is the 3rd. So the answer is 3.", "3"], [74, "Between Tuesday, November 8, 2022 and Friday, December 16, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Answer with a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, November 8, 2022, and Friday, December 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. November 8, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to calculate it. Let me think. Let's see, November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday? Let me check. Wait, I think November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but if that's the case, then November 8 would be the next Tuesday. So November 8 is a Tuesday. Then the period starts on Tuesday, November 8, and ends on Friday, December 16.\n\nSo the total days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive. Let me calculate the number of days. Let's break it down into months. November has 30 days. So from November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 = 22 days, but since we include both start and end dates, it's 22 + 1 = 23 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have from day X to day Y inclusive, the number of days is Y - X + 1. So November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. So total days would be 23 + 16 = 39 days. Wait, but that's from November 8 to December 16 inclusive. Let me check that again. November 8 to November 30 is 23 days (including both). Then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. So total is 23 + 16 = 39 days. So total days between those dates is 39 days.\n\nNow, out of these 39 days, how many are weekends? Let's figure out how many Saturdays and Sundays there are in this period.\n\nStarting from November 8, which is a Tuesday. Let's list the days of the week for each date.\n\nFirst, November 8 is Tuesday. Then November 9 is Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday, 13 Sunday. So the first weekend in November is 12 (Sat) and 13 (Sun). Then the next weekend would be 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), then 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Then December 1 is a Thursday (since November 26 is Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday, December 1 is Thursday). Wait, let me check that again. Wait, November 26 is Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday, December 1 is Thursday. So December 1 is Thursday. Then December 2 is Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, 6 Tuesday, 7 Wednesday, 8 Thursday, 9 Friday, 10 Saturday, 11 Sunday, 12 Monday, 13 Tuesday, 14 Wednesday, 15 Thursday, 16 Friday.\n\nSo the weekends in this period are:\n\nNovember: 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun).\n\nDecember: 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun). Wait, but the end date is December 16. So December 16 is a Friday. So the last weekend in the period would be December 16? No, December 16 is Friday. So the last weekend would be December 16 minus 1 day, which is December 15 (Thursday), so the last weekend is December 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun). Wait, but December 17 is a Saturday, but the end date is December 16. So December 17 is outside the range. So the weekends in December are 3,4,10,11. Wait, December 17 is Saturday, but that's after December 16. So in December, the weekends are 3,4,10,11. Wait, but December 16 is the end date. So let me check again.\n\nWait, December 1 is Thursday. So:\n\nDec 1: Thu\n\nDec 2: Fri\n\nDec 3: Sat\n\nDec 4: Sun\n\nDec 5: Mon\n\nDec 6: Tue\n\nDec 7: Wed\n\nDec 8: Thu\n\nDec 9: Fri\n\nDec 10: Sat\n\nDec 11: Sun\n\nDec 12: Mon\n\nDec 13: Tue\n\nDec 14: Wed\n\nDec 15: Thu\n\nDec 16: Fri\n\nSo in December, the weekends are Dec 3, 4, 10, 11. That's four weekends. Then in November, the weekends are 12,13,19,20,26,27. That's six weekends. So total weekends are 6 + 4 = 10 days. So total business days would be total days (39) minus weekends (10) = 29 days. Wait, but let me check again. Wait, November has 23 days (from 8 to 30 inclusive). Let me check how many weekends are in November. From November 8 to November 30.\n\nNovember 8 is Tuesday. So the first weekend in November is 12 (Sat) and 13 (Sun). Then next is 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun). Then 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). So that's 6 days. So 6 weekends in November. Then December has 16 days (from 1 to 16). The weekends in December are 3,4,10,11. That's 4 days. So total weekends are 6 + 4 = 10. So total business days would be 39 - 10 = 29. But wait, let me check again. Wait, the total days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive is 39 days. Let me confirm that again. November has 30 days. From November 8 to November 30 is 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Then December 1 to December 16 is 16 days. 23 + 16 = 39. Yes. So 39 days total. 10 weekends. So 39 - 10 = 29 business days. But wait, let me check if there's any mistake in the weekend count. Let me list all the weekends in the period.\n\nNovember weekends:\n\n12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 6 days.\n\nDecember weekends:\n\n3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun). That's 4 days. Total 10. So yes. So 39 - 10 = 29. But wait, let me check another way. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tuesday) to December 16 (Friday). Let's count each week.\n\nFrom November 8 (Tuesday) to November 11 (Friday) is 4 days (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri). Then November 12 (Sat) is a weekend. November 13 (Sun) is weekend. Then November 14 (Mon) to November 17 (Thu) is 4 days. Then November 18 (Fri) to November 21 (Mon) is 4 days. Wait, maybe this approach is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of weeks and days.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the total days as 39. If I subtract the weekends, which are 10, then 39 - 10 = 29. But maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again. Let's count the days from November 8 to December 16 inclusive.\n\nNovember 8 is day 1. Then November 9 is day 2, ..., November 30 is day 23. Then December 1 is day 24, December 2 is 25, ..., December 16 is day 24 + 15 = 39. Yes, that's correct. So 39 days. So 39 - 10 = 29. But wait, maybe I missed a weekend? Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, November 26 is Saturday, 27 Sunday. Then December 1 is Thursday. So December 3 is Saturday, 4 Sunday. Then December 10 is Saturday, 11 Sunday. Then December 17 is Saturday, but that's beyond the end date. So that's correct. So 6 + 4 = 10 weekends. So 29 business days. But wait, let me check another way. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays in the period.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tuesday). Let's list the days:\n\nNovember 8: Tue\n\n9: Wed\n\n10: Thu\n\n11: Fri\n\n12: Sat\n\n13: Sun\n\n14: Mon\n\n15: Tue\n\n16: Wed\n\n17: Thu\n\n18: Fri\n\n19: Sat\n\n20: Sun\n\n21: Mon\n\n22: Tue\n\n23: Wed\n\n24: Thu\n\n25: Fri\n\n26: Sat\n\n27: Sun\n\n28: Mon\n\n29: Tue\n\n30: Wed\n\nDecember 1: Thu\n\n2: Fri\n\n3: Sat\n\n4: Sun\n\n5: Mon\n\n6: Tue\n\n7: Wed\n\n8: Thu\n\n9: Fri\n\n10: Sat\n\n11: Sun\n\n12: Mon\n\n13: Tue\n\n14: Wed\n\n15: Thu\n\n16: Fri\n\nNow, let's count the number of each weekday.\n\nTuesdays: November 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 4 Tuesdays.\n\nWednesdays: 9, 16, 23, 30. 4 Wednesdays.\n\nThursdays: 10, 17, 24, 8 (wait, no. Wait, November 10 is Thursday, 17, 24, and December 1 is Thursday. So that's 4 Thursdays.\n\nFridays: 11, 18, 25, 2 (December 2), 9 (December 9), 16 (December 16). Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, November 11 is Friday. Then 18, 25. Then December 2, 9, 16. That's 6 Fridays.\n\nWait, that's 6 Fridays. So total business days would be 4 (Tue) + 4 (Wed) + 4 (Thu) + 6 (Fri) = 18? Wait, but that's only 18. But that can't be right. Wait, what about Mondays?\n\nMondays: November 14, 21, 28. Then December 5, 12, 19. Wait, December 19 is beyond the end date (December 16). So November 14, 21, 28. Then December 5, 12. That's 5 Mondays. So Mondays: 5.\n\nSo total business days would be 5 (Mon) + 4 (Tue) + 4 (Wed) + 4 (Thu) + 6 (Fri) = 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 23? Wait, that's 23. But earlier calculation said 29. There's a discrepancy here. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me recount the days. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekdays.\n\nLet me list all the business days from November 8 to December 16.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tue) to December 16 (Fri). Let's list each day and check if it's a business day.\n\nNovember 8: Tue (business)\n\n9: Wed\n\n10: Thu\n\n11: Fri\n\n12: Sat (non-business)\n\n13: Sun (non-business)\n\n14: Mon\n\n15: Tue\n\n16: Wed\n\n17: Thu\n\n18: Fri\n\n19: Sat\n\n20: Sun\n\n21: Mon\n\n22: Tue\n\n23: Wed\n\n24: Thu\n\n25: Fri\n\n26: Sat\n\n27: Sun\n\n28: Mon\n\n29: Tue\n\n30: Wed\n\nDecember 1: Thu\n\n2: Fri\n\n3: Sat\n\n4: Sun\n\n5: Mon\n\n6: Tue\n\n7: Wed\n\n8: Thu\n\n9: Fri\n\n10: Sat\n\n11: Sun\n\n12: Mon\n\n13: Tue\n\n14: Wed\n\n15: Thu\n\n16: Fri\n\nNow, let's count the business days (Mon-Fri):\n\nNovember 8 (Tue) - yes\n\n9 (Wed) - yes\n\n10 (Thu) - yes\n\n11 (Fri) - yes\n\n14 (Mon) - yes\n\n15 (Tue) - yes\n\n16 (Wed) - yes\n\n17 (Thu) - yes\n\n18 (Fri) - yes\n\n21 (Mon) - yes\n\n22 (Tue) - yes\n\n23 (Wed) - yes\n\n24 (Thu) - yes\n\n25 (Fri) - yes\n\n28 (Mon) - yes\n\n29 (Tue) - yes\n\n30 (Wed) - yes\n\nDecember 1 (Thu) - yes\n\n2 (Fri) - yes\n\n5 (Mon) - yes\n\n6 (Tue) - yes\n\n7 (Wed) - yes\n\n8 (Thu) - yes\n\n9 (Fri) - yes\n\n12 (Mon) - yes\n\n13 (Tue) - yes\n\n14 (Wed) - yes\n\n15 (Thu) - yes\n\n16 (Fri) - yes\n\nNow, let's count these:\n\n1. 8\n\n2. 9\n\n3. 10\n\n4. 11\n\n5. 14\n\n6. 15\n\n7. 16\n\n8. 17\n\n9. 18\n\n10. 21\n\n11. 22\n\n12. 23\n\n13. 24\n\n14. 25\n\n15. 28\n\n16. 29\n\n17. 30\n\n18. 1\n\n19. 2\n\n20. 5\n\n21. 6\n\n22. 7\n\n23. 8\n\n24. 9\n\n25. 12\n\n26. 13\n\n27. 14\n\n28. 15\n\n29. 16\n\nSo that's 29 business days.

Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1940 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1940 divided by 4. 4 times 485 is 1940, right? So 4 x 485 = 1940. That means 1940 is divisible by 4. So that's the first condition satisfied.\n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 1940 divided by 100 is 19.4, which isn't a whole number. So 1940 isn't a century year. Therefore, the second condition about being divisible by 400 doesn't apply here.\n\nSince 1940 is divisible by 4 and not a century year, it should be a leap year. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me calculate 1940 divided by 4 again. 4 times 400 is 1600, subtract that from 1940, you get 340. 4 times 85 is 340. So 400 + 85 is 485. So yes, 4 x 485 is indeed 1940. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, since it's divisible by 4 and not a century year, 1940 is a leap year.", "Yes."], [74, "Determine the day of the month for the second Tuesday in November 2022.

Alright, so first, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 10th. Well, from the 1st to the 10th is 9 days later, right? Because if you count from the 1st to the 2nd is one day, so 10 minus 1 is 9 days.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Saturday, adding 9 days to that. Let me think about how the days of the week cycle. There are 7 days in a week, so every 7 days, the cycle repeats. So, if I divide 9 by 7, the remainder will tell me how many days beyond the week I need to count.\n\nLet me do the division: 9 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 2. So that means 9 days later is 1 week and 2 days. So starting from Saturday, adding 7 days would still be Saturday. Then adding 2 more days.

So to find March 14th, I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 14th, then find the remainder when divided by 7 to determine the weekday.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 14th is 14 days after February 28th. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 58 + 14 = 72 days.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is Sunday. So January 1st is day 0 (Sunday), January 2nd is day 1 (Monday), and so on. So the total number of days from January 1st to March 14th is 72 days. But since we start counting from day 0, the number of days between January 1st and March 14th is 72 days. But to find the weekday, we can take 72 mod 7. Because each week has 7 days.\n\nSo 72 divided by 7 is 10 weeks (70 days) with a remainder of 2 days. So 72 mod 7 is 2. So that means March 14th is 2 days after Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 days is Tuesday. So March 14th would be a Tuesday?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 14th is 14 days. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 30 + 28 + 14 = 72 days. Yes, that's correct. So 72 days later.\n\nBut wait, if January 1st is Sunday, then adding 7 days would be Sunday again. So 72 divided by 7 is 10*7=70, remainder 2. So 70 days later is Sunday again, then 2 more days would be Monday (day 1) and Tuesday (day 2). So March 14th is Tuesday. Hmm. But I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Sunday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Sunday. Then January 8th is Sunday again (7 days later), January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Wait, March 14th is two days before March 16th. Wait, March 5th is a Sunday (since January 1st is Sunday, adding 31 days (January) + 5 days (March 5th) is 36 days. Wait, maybe this approach is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of days from January 1st to March 14th. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 14th is 14 days. So total is 30 + 28 + 14 = 72 days. So 72 days after January 1st. Since January 1st is Sunday, adding 72 days. 72 divided by 7 is 10 weeks (70 days) and 2 days. So 70 days later is Sunday, then 2 days later is Monday and Tuesday. So March 14th is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check with a different method.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days for each month. Let's start with January 1st as Sunday. Then:\n\nJanuary 1st: Sunday\n\nJanuary 2nd: Monday\n\n...\n\nJanuary 7th: Saturday\n\nJanuary 8th: Sunday\n\nSo every 7 days, it cycles. So January 1st is Sunday, January 8th is Sunday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Sunday (since 29th Jan + 6 days is Feb 5th). Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is Sunday (Feb 26th + 7 days). Then March 12th is Sunday, March 19th, 26th. So March 14th is two days before March 16th. Wait, March 5th is Sunday. March 5th + 7 days is March 12th (Sunday). March 12th + 7 days is March 19th (Sunday). So March 14th is 3 days before March 19th. March 19th is Sunday, so March 18th is Saturday, March 17th is Friday, March 16th is Thursday, March 15th is Wednesday, March 14th is Tuesday. So that's consistent with the previous calculation. So March 14th is Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "If a meeting is scheduled on the last Thursday of June 2022, on which day of the month does it occur?

Because if I know that, I can count the days to find the last Thursday.\n\nWait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I should check a calendar or use some method to calculate it. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me think. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Saturday. Then February 1 is a Monday (since 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days, so adding 3 days to Saturday gives Tuesday? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again.\n\nWait, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, and so on. So February 1, 2022, would be 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday (January 1) would be Tuesday. So February 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Then March 1 would be 28 days later (February 2022 is not a leap year, so 28 days). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Tuesday (March 1) would be Friday. So April 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Friday (April 1) would be Sunday. So May 1, 2022, was a Sunday.

Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2098 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2098. First, divide 2098 by 4. Let's do the division: 2098 divided by 4. 4 times 524 is 2096, so 2098 minus 2096 is 2. That leaves a remainder of 2, so 2098 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that division. Let me add 4 to 2096 to get 2100. So 2098 is two years before 2100, which is 2098. So yes, 2098 divided by 4 is 524.5, which is not an integer. So definitely not divisible by 4. Therefore, 2098 is not a leap year. \n\nBut just to be thorough, even though it's not divisible by 4, maybe there's some exception? No, the rules are pretty straightforward. The only exceptions are for century years. Since 2098 isn't a century year (it's not divisible by 100), the second condition doesn't apply. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, February 6 to Friday, March 4, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between Sunday, February 6, 2022, and Friday, March 4, 2022, inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the dates involved. Let me check the dates. February 6, 2022, is a Sunday. Then March 4 is a Friday. So the period starts on a Sunday and ends on a Friday. I need to count all the days from February 6 to March 4, but only include the weekdays.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's first find out how many days are there in total between those dates, then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, I can count the weekdays directly.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to list out the dates and count. Let me think. Let's start with February 6, 2022. That's a Sunday. So the next day, February 7 is a Monday. Then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, etc.\n\nWait, but I need to go up to March 4. Let me check the dates. Let me check how many days are in February 2022. 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So February 6 is Sunday, then February 7 is Monday, and so on. Let me calculate the number of days from February 6 to March 4.\n\nFirst, from February 6 to February 28 inclusive. Then March 1 to March 4.\n\nFebruary 6 to February 28: that's 28 - 6 + 1 = 23 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you have from day 6 to day 28 inclusive, the number of days is 28 - 6 + 1 = 23 days. But wait, February 6 is day 1, then February 7 is day 2, etc. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the formula is (end - start + 1). So if I start on February 6 (day 1) and end on February 28 (day 23), that's 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total days from February 6 to March 4 inclusive is 23 + 4 = 27 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Let me count the days in February. February 6 to February 28: 28 - 6 = 22 days, plus 1 for the inclusive, so 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total 23 + 4 = 27 days. So total days between those dates is 27 days.\n\nNow, out of these 27 days, how many are weekdays? Let's see. The first day is Sunday (Feb 6), then Monday (Feb 7), Tuesday (Feb 8), Wednesday (Feb 9), Thursday (Feb 10), Friday (Feb 11), Saturday (Feb 12), Sunday (Feb 13), and so on.\n\nSo in the first week (Feb 6-12), the weekdays are Monday (7), Tuesday (8), Wednesday (9), Thursday (10), Friday (11). That's 5 weekdays. Then Saturday (12) and Sunday (13) are weekends. Then the next week starts on Monday, Feb 14. So each week has 5 weekdays.\n\nNow, let's see how many weeks are in the 27 days. Let's see, 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So 3 weeks is 21 days, and 6 days remaining. So the first 21 days would be 3 weeks, and then 6 days more.\n\nBut wait, the first day is Sunday, so the first week (days 1-7) is Sunday (6), Monday (7), Tuesday (8), Wednesday (9), Thursday (10), Friday (11), Saturday (12). Then the next week (days 8-14) would be Sunday (13), Monday (14), Tuesday (15), Wednesday (16), Thursday (17), Friday (18), Saturday (19). Then the third week (days 15-21) would be Sunday (20), Monday (21), Tuesday (22), Wednesday (23), Thursday (24), Friday (25), Saturday (26). Then the remaining days are 27th day, which is March 4, which is a Friday.\n\nWait, but let me check the actual dates. Let me list the dates from Feb 6 to March 4 and count the weekdays.\n\nStarting with Feb 6 (Sunday), then:\n\nFeb 6: Sunday (weekend)\nFeb 7: Monday (weekday)\nFeb 8: Tuesday (weekday)\nFeb 9: Wednesday (weekday)\nFeb 10: Thursday (weekday)\nFeb 11: Friday (weekday)\nFeb 12: Saturday (weekend)\nFeb 13: Sunday (weekend)\nFeb 14: Monday (weekday)\nFeb 15: Tuesday (weekday)\nFeb 16: Wednesday (weekday)\nFeb 17: Thursday (weekday)\nFeb 18: Friday (weekday)\nFeb 19: Saturday (weekend)\nFeb 20: Sunday (weekend)\nFeb 21: Monday (weekday)\nFeb 22: Tuesday (weekday)\nFeb 23: Wednesday (weekday)\nFeb 24: Thursday (weekday)\nFeb 25: Friday (weekday)\nFeb 26: Saturday (weekend)\nFeb 27: Sunday (weekend)\nFeb 28: Monday (weekday)\nMarch 1: Tuesday (weekday)\nMarch 2: Wednesday (weekday)\nMarch 3: Thursday (weekday)\nMarch 4: Friday (weekday)\n\nNow, let's count the weekdays.

So the answer should be 20.\n\nAlternatively, another way to calculate is to find the total days (27) and subtract the number of weekends. Let's see. How many weekends are there in those 27 days?\n\nFrom the list above, the weekends are:\n\nFeb 6, 12, 13, 19, 20, 26, 27. That's 7 weekends. So 27 total days minus 7 weekends equals 20 weekdays.

I need to find out how many Mondays there are between June 12, 2022 (Sunday) and July 28, 2022 (Thursday), inclusive. Hmm. So first, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those days are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates or find the first and last day of the week in that range. Let me start by checking what day of the week June 12, 2022 was. The problem says it's a Sunday. So June 12 is a Sunday. Then June 13 would be a Monday. So the first Monday in this period is June 13, 2022.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many Mondays are there until July 28, 2022. Let me figure out the total number of days between June 12 and July 28, inclusive. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, June has 30 days. So from June 12 to June 30, that's 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to calculate the total days. Wait, the period is from June 12 to July 28, inclusive. Let me calculate the total days.\n\nJune has 30 days. So from June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have June 12 (inclusive) to June 13 (inclusive), that's 2 days. So the formula is end date minus start date plus 1. So June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then July has 31 days, but we only go up to July 28. So July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total days from June 12 to July 28 is 19 (June) + 28 (July) = 47 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, June 12 to June 30 is 19 days. Then July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total is 19 + 28 = 47 days. So the total number of days in the period is 47.\n\nNow, since the first day is a Sunday (June 12), then the next day, June 13, is a Monday. So the Mondays would be every 7 days after that. So the first Monday is June 13, then June 20, June 27, July 4, July 11, July 18, July 25. Let me count those.\n\nJune 13, 20, 27 (three Mondays in June). Then July 4, 11, 18, 25 (four Mondays in July). So total of 3 + 4 = 7 Mondays. Wait, but let me check if July 25 is within the period. The period ends on July 28, so July 25 is included. So that's correct. So that's 7 Mondays. But wait, let me check again. Let me list them all:\n\nJune 13 (Monday)\nJune 20 (Monday)\nJune 27 (Monday)\nJuly 4 (Monday)\nJuly 11 (Monday)\nJuly 18 (Monday)\nJuly 25 (Monday)\n\nThat's seven Mondays. So the answer should be 7. But wait, let me confirm the total days again. If there are 47 days in total, and the first day is Sunday, then the number of Mondays would be the number of times the 1st day of the week (Sunday) plus 1, 8, 15, etc. Wait, but since the first day is Sunday, the first Monday is day 2. So the Mondays would be on days 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44. Let me check how many days that is. Let's count:\n\nDay 1: June 12 (Sunday)\nDay 2: June 13 (Monday)\nDay 3: June 14 (Tuesday)\n...\nDay 7: June 18 (Saturday)\nDay 8: June 19 (Sunday)\nDay 9: June 20 (Monday)\nSo that's correct. So the Mondays are on days 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44. Now, the total days in the period is 47. So day 44 is July 25 (since day 44 is 44 days after June 12). Then day 44 + 7 = 51, which would be July 25 + 7 = August 1, which is outside the period. So the last Monday is July 25. So that's 7 Mondays.

I need to find out how many business days there are from Monday, January 24, 2022, to Tuesday, March 22, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days, then count the business days accordingly.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. January 24, 2022 is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think January 24, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can count the days. But maybe I should just proceed step by step.\n\nSo, the period starts on a Monday, January 24, 2022, and ends on Tuesday, March 22, 2022. Let me break this down into months: January, February, and March.\n\nFirst, from January 24 to January 31. Let's count the days. January 24 is Monday. Then January 25 is Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So from January 24 to January 31 inclusive, that's 8 days. But how many business days are in that period?\n\nJanuary 24 is Monday (business day), 25 Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday. Then 29 is Saturday (non-business), 30 Sunday (non-business), 31 Monday (business). So in January, from the 24th to the 31st, there are 5 business days (24-28) plus 31, so 6 business days? Wait, let me count again:\n\nJanuary 24 (Mon) - business\n25 (Tue) - business\n26 (Wed) - business\n27 (Thu) - business\n28 (Fri) - business\n29 (Sat) - no\n30 (Sun) - no\n31 (Mon) - business\n\nSo that's 6 business days in January.\n\nThen February 2022. February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. So February 1 is a Tuesday (since January 31 is a Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday). Wait, January 31 is Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Let me check that. If January 31 is Monday, then February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday, and the month ends on February 28, which is a Monday (since 28 days later, 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks, so same day of the week as February 1, which is Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, if February 1 is Tuesday, then February 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. But 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So February 28 is 28 days after February 1. 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks, so February 28 is also a Tuesday? Wait, that can't be. Wait, if February 1 is Tuesday, then adding 7 days (February 8) is also Tuesday. Then February 15, 22, and 29 (but 2022 doesn't have a 29th). So February 28 is 28 days after February 1. 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks, so same day of the week. So February 28 is Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean that February 28 is a Tuesday. But that would mean that February 27 is Monday. Let me check that again. If February 1 is Tuesday, then February 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday. Wait, that's 7 days. So February 7 is Monday. Then February 14 is Monday, 21, 28. So February 28 is Monday? Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's start over. January 31 is Monday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday. So February 7 is Monday. Then February 14 is Monday, 21, 28. So February 28 is Monday. Therefore, February 28 is a Monday. So that's correct. So February has 28 days, ending on Monday, February 28. So in February, how many business days are there?\n\nFrom February 1 (Tuesday) to February 28 (Monday). Let's count the days. Since February has 28 days, that's 28 days total. Let's count the number of weekends. The weekends in February would be Saturdays and Sundays. Let's see:\n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend is February 5 (Saturday) and 6 (Sunday). Then 12, 13; 19, 20; 26, 27. Then the next weekend would be March 1 and 2, but March is outside the range. So in February, the weekends are 5-6, 12-13, 19-20, 26-27. That's 4 weekends, each with 2 days, so 8 weekend days. So total days in February is 28. So business days would be 28 - 8 = 20 business days. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, since February 1 is Tuesday, and ends on Monday, February 28. So the days from Tuesday to Monday. Let's count the business days. Each week has 5 business days. There are 4 weeks in February (28 days), so 4*5=20 business days. That matches. So that's 20 business days in February.\n\nThen March. The period ends on March 22, 2022. Let's check what day March 22 is. Since February 28 is a Monday, March 1 is Tuesday. Let me confirm that. February 28 is Monday, so March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 1 is Tuesday, 2 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, etc. So March 22 is the 22nd day of March. Let's count how many days from March 1 to March 22. That's 22 days. Let's find out how many weekends are in that period.\n\nMarch 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend is March 5 (Saturday) and 6 (Sunday). Then 12, 13; 19, 20. Then March 26, 27 would be the next weekend, but March 22 is before that. So in March, from March 1 to March 22, the weekends are 5-6, 12-13, 19-20. That's three weekends, each with 2 days, so 6 weekend days. So total days in March from 1 to 22 is 22 days. So business days would be 22 - 6 = 16 business days. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, since March 1 is Tuesday, and March 22 is Tuesday (since 22 days later, 22 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 1 day. So March 1 is Tuesday, March 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22. So March 22 is Tuesday. So the days from March 1 to March 22 include 22 days. Let's count the business days. From Tuesday (March 1) to Tuesday (March 22). Let's count the number of weeks. 22 days is 3 weeks (21 days) plus 1 day. So 3 weeks have 5 business days each, so 15, plus the extra day (March 22) which is a Tuesday, a business day. So total business days would be 15 + 1 = 16. That matches. So March has 16 business days.\n\nSo adding up the business days:\n\nJanuary: 6\nFebruary: 20\nMarch: 16\nTotal: 6 + 20 = 26, plus 16 is 42.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because the original period is from January 24 (Monday) to March 22 (Tuesday). So in January, we had 6 business days. Then February 20, then March 16. So 6+20+16=42. But let me check if there's any mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total days between the two dates and subtract the weekends. Let's try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of days from January 24 to March 22 inclusive.\n\nJanuary 24 to January 31: 8 days (as before)\nFebruary has 28 days\nMarch 1 to March 22: 22 days\nTotal days: 8 + 28 + 22 = 58 days.\n\nNow, subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period.\n\nBut how many weekends are there?\n\nLet me check the dates again. January 24 is Monday. So the first weekend in January is January 29 (Saturday) and 30 (Sunday). Then February has weekends as 5-6, 12-13, 19-20, 26-27. Then March has weekends as 5-6, 12-13, 19-20. But March 22 is Tuesday, so the weekends in March up to March 22 are 5-6, 12-13, 19-20. So that's 3 weekends in March.\n\nSo total weekends:\n\nJanuary: 2 (29-30)\nFebruary: 4 weekends (each 2 days) = 8 days\nMarch: 3 weekends (each 2 days) = 6 days\nTotal weekends: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 days.\n\nSo total business days would be total days (58) minus weekends (16) = 42. That matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 42.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because when I calculated the business days per month, I had 6 in January, 20 in February, 16 in March. 6+20=26, 26+16=42. So that's correct. So the answer is 42.", "42"], [74, "Count forward 99 days from Monday, December 26, 2022 - what's the weekday? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count 99 days forward from Monday, December 26, 2022, and find out what day of the week that falls on. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 99 days. Let me divide 99 by 7. 7 times 14 is 98, so that's 14 weeks and 1 day. Wait, 14 weeks would be exactly 98 days, so adding 1 more day would make it 99 days. So if I start on a Monday, adding 14 weeks (which is 98 days) would still be a Monday, right? Then adding one more day would take it to Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the dates? Wait, December 26, 2022, is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Let me think, December 26, 2022. I know that December 25, 2022, was a Sunday, so December 26 would be a Monday. That's correct.\n\nNow, adding 99 days. Let me break it down. 99 days is 14 weeks (98 days) plus 1 day. So adding 14 weeks would bring me back to the same day of the week, Monday. Then adding one more day would be Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday. But maybe I should check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the days step by step. Let's see. Starting from December 26, 2022 (Monday). Let's count the days forward. But that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Since 99 divided by 7 gives a remainder of 1 (because 7*14=98, 99-98=1). So the remainder is 1. So adding 1 day to Monday would be Tuesday. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the date calculation is correct. For example, if I add 99 days to December 26, 2022, what is the actual date? Let me try to calculate that. December has 31 days, so December 26 plus 4 days would be December 30, then 31 days in December. So from December 26 to December 31 is 5 days. Then January has 31 days, February 2023 has 28 days (since 2023 is not a leap year), March has 31, etc. But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the number of days in each month. Let's try to count 99 days from December 26, 2022. Let's start:\n\nDecember 26, 2022 (Monday) is day 0.\n\nAdd 1 day: December 27, 2022 (Tuesday) - day 1.\n\nBut this would take too long to count 99 days manually. Maybe I can use the fact that 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. So if I add 14 weeks (98 days) to December 26, 2022, that would be December 26 + 98 days. Let's calculate that date. December has 31 days, so 31 - 26 = 5 days remaining in December. So adding 5 days would take me to December 31, 2022. Then 98 days is 5 days in December (to reach December 31) plus 93 days in the next months. Wait, 98 days total. Wait, maybe this approach is not the best. Alternatively, since 98 days is exactly 14 weeks, adding 14 weeks to December 26, 2022, would be the same day of the week, Monday. Then adding one more day would be Tuesday. So the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no errors in the assumption that 99 days is exactly 14 weeks and 1 day. Let me check 7*14=98, so 98+1=99. Yes, that's correct. So the remainder is 1. Therefore, the weekday would be Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Thursday, September 15 to Saturday, November 26, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Express your answer as a number.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between Thursday, September 15 and Saturday, November 26, 2022, including both dates. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. September 15 is a Thursday. Then November 26 is a Saturday. Let me confirm the dates. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. Let me check the days of the week for each month.\n\nFirst, September 15 is a Thursday. Let's count the days from September 15 to November 26.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So from September 15 to September 30 is 16 days (including both start and end). Wait, September 15 is day 1, then September 16 is day 2, etc. So from September 15 to September 30 is 30 - 15 + 1 = 16 days. But wait, September 15 is included, so that's correct.\n\nThen October has 31 days. November has 30 days, so up to November 26 is 26 days. So total days from September 15 to November 26 is 16 (September) + 31 (October) + 26 (November) = 16 + 31 is 47, plus 26 is 73 days total. Wait, but that's including both start and end dates. Wait, no. Wait, if I do September 15 to September 30, that's 16 days. Then October is 31 days, and November 1 to November 26 is 26 days. So total is 16 + 31 + 26 = 73 days. So total days between those two dates is 73 days.\n\nBut now I need to find how many of those are weekdays. So total days is 73. Now, how many weekends are in that period?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of weeks and then add the remaining days. Let's see. Let's start with September 15, which is a Thursday. So the first day is Thursday. Let's count the days in each month.\n\nSeptember: 16 days (from 15th to 30th). Let's list the days of the week for September. September 15 is Thursday. So September 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed), 22 (Thu), 23 (Fri), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun), 26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed), 29 (Thu), 30 (Fri). So in September, from 15th to 30th, there are 16 days. Let's count the weekdays (Mon-Fri) in this period.\n\nLooking at the days:\n\nSeptember 15: Thu (weekday)\n16: Fri (weekday)\n17: Sat (weekend)\n18: Sun (weekend)\n19: Mon (weekday)\n20: Tue (weekday)\n21: Wed (weekday)\n22: Thu (weekday)\n23: Fri (weekday)\n24: Sat (weekend)\n25: Sun (weekend)\n26: Mon (weekday)\n27: Tue (weekday)\n28: Wed (weekday)\n29: Thu (weekday)\n30: Fri (weekday)\n\nSo from September 15 to 30, how many weekdays? Let's count:\n\nThu (15), Fri (16), Mon (19), Tue (20), Wed (21), Thu (22), Fri (23), Mon (26), Tue (27), Wed (28), Thu (29), Fri (30). That's 12 weekdays. Wait, let me count again:\n\n15 (Thu), 16 (Fri) = 2\n19 (Mon), 20 (Tue), 21 (Wed) = 3 more (total 5)\n22 (Thu), 23 (Fri) = 2 more (total 7)\n26 (Mon), 27 (Tue), 28 (Wed) = 3 more (total 10)\n29 (Thu), 30 (Fri) = 2 more (total 12). Yes, 12 weekdays in September.\n\nNow October has 31 days. October 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, let me check. Wait, September 15 is Thursday. September 16 is Friday. September 17 is Saturday. So September 17 is Saturday. Then October 1 is 17 days after September 15. Wait, September 15 is day 0. September 16 is day 1, etc. Wait, maybe I should check the actual day of the week for October 1, 2022. Alternatively, since September 15 is Thursday, September 16 is Friday, September 17 is Saturday. Then September 24 is Saturday (since 17 + 7 = 24). Then October 1 is 24 + 7 = 31 days? Wait, no. Wait, September has 30 days. So September 15 is Thursday. September 30 is Friday. Then October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday, etc.\n\nSo in October, the first day is Saturday. So the first week of October starts on Saturday. So the weekdays in October would be Monday to Friday. Let's count the number of weekdays in October. October has 31 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. So in 4 weeks, there are 4*5=20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days are October 31 (Monday), November 1 (Tuesday), November 2 (Wednesday). Wait, no. Wait, October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri), 8 (Sat), etc. So the first week of October has 3 days (Sat, Sun, Mon) as the first three days. Then the next weeks are Mon-Fri, then Sat-Sun, etc. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of weekdays in October.\n\nSince October 1 is Saturday, the first weekday is October 3 (Monday). Then the last day of October is October 31, which is a Monday (since October 31 is 31 days after October 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So October 1 is Saturday, adding 3 days gets to Monday. So October 31 is Monday. So the last day of October is Monday.\n\nSo the weekdays in October are from October 3 (Mon) to October 31 (Mon). Let's count how many weeks that is. From October 3 to October 31 is 29 days. Wait, October 3 is day 1, October 31 is day 29. Wait, 31 - 3 + 1 = 29 days. So 29 days. How many weeks is that? 29 days is 4 weeks (28 days) and 1 day. So 4 weeks have 20 weekdays, and the remaining 1 day is Monday (October 31). So total weekdays in October would be 20 + 1 = 21? Wait, but wait, the first day of the month is Saturday, so the first week has 3 days (Sat, Sun, Mon). So the first week has 1 weekday (Monday). Then the next weeks are 4 weeks (each with 5 weekdays). Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Alternatively, since October has 31 days, and the first day is Saturday, the number of weekdays can be calculated as follows:\n\nIn a 31-day month starting on Saturday, the number of weekdays is:\n\nNumber of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays.\n\nSince the first day is Saturday, the first week has 1 Monday (day 3), then each subsequent week has 5 weekdays. The last day is Monday (day 31). So the total number of weekdays is 5 * 4 (for the 4 full weeks) plus 1 (for the last day). Wait, 4 weeks is 28 days. So days 1-28: 4 weeks. Then days 29-31 are 3 days. So in days 29-31: day 29 is Tuesday (since day 1 is Saturday, day 29 is 28 days later, which is Saturday again, plus 1 day is Sunday, day 29 is Sunday? Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, October 1 is Saturday. So:\n\nOctober 1: Saturday (day 1)\nOctober 2: Sunday (day 2)\nOctober 3: Monday (day 3)\nOctober 4: Tuesday (day 4)\nOctober 5: Wednesday (day 5)\nOctober 6: Thursday (day 6)\nOctober 7: Friday (day 7)\nOctober 8: Saturday (day 8)\n... and so on.\n\nSo each week is 7 days. So day 1 is Saturday, day 8 is Saturday, day 15 is Saturday, day 22 is Saturday, day 29 is Saturday. Then day 30 is Sunday, day 31 is Monday.\n\nSo the last day of October is Monday, October 31. So the weekdays in October are:\n\nFrom day 3 (Monday) to day 7 (Friday) = 5 weekdays (week 1)\nThen day 10 (Monday) to day 14 (Friday) = 5 weekdays (week 2)\nDay 17 (Monday) to day 21 (Friday) = 5 weekdays (week 3)\nDay 24 (Monday) to day 28 (Friday) = 5 weekdays (week 4)\nThen day 31 (Monday) is the last day. So that's 1 more weekday.\n\nSo total weekdays in October: 5*4 + 1 = 21. So 21 weekdays in October.\n\nNow November. November 1, 2022 is Tuesday. Wait, October 31 is Monday, so November 1 is Tuesday. So November 1 is Tuesday. The end date is November 26, which is Saturday. So November has 30 days. Let's count the weekdays from November 1 to November 26.\n\nNovember 1 is Tuesday. November 26 is Saturday. Let's count the number of weekdays in this period.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many days are in November from 1 to 26. That's 26 days. Let's check the days of the week for each.\n\nNovember 1: Tuesday\nNovember 2: Wednesday\nNovember 3: Thursday\nNovember 4: Friday\nNovember 5: Saturday\nNovember 6: Sunday\nNovember 7: Monday\nNovember 8: Tuesday\n... and so on.\n\nSo the first week (days 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and 2 weekends (Saturday, Sunday). Then each subsequent week has 5 weekdays.\n\nBut since the period is from November 1 to November 26, which is 26 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 26 days is 3 weeks and 5 days (since 3*7=21, 26-21=5). So 3 full weeks (21 days) plus 5 days.\n\nIn the 3 full weeks, there are 3*5=15 weekdays. Then the remaining 5 days are November 22 (Monday), 23 (Tuesday), 24 (Wednesday), 25 (Thursday), 26 (Friday). Wait, wait. Wait, November 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the days:\n\nWeek 1: Nov 1 (Tue) to Nov 7 (Mon)\nWeek 2: Nov 8 (Tue) to Nov 14 (Mon)\nWeek 3: Nov 15 (Tue) to Nov 21 (Mon)\nWeek 4: Nov 22 (Tue) to Nov 28 (Mon)\nBut our end date is November 26, which is Saturday. So the last week is only up to November 26.\n\nSo the first three weeks (21 days) have 15 weekdays. Then the remaining 5 days (Nov 22-26) are:\n\nNov 22: Tuesday\nNov 23: Wednesday\nNov 24: Thursday\nNov 25: Friday\nNov 26: Saturday\n\nSo in these 5 days, the weekdays are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (4 days). So total weekdays in November would be 15 + 4 = 19.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The first three weeks (21 days) are from Nov 1 to Nov 21. Then the next 5 days are Nov 22 to Nov 26. So in the first three weeks, each week has 5 weekdays. So 3*5=15. Then in the remaining 5 days, Nov 22 (Tue) to Nov 26 (Sat), the weekdays are Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri (4 days). So total 15 + 4 = 19 weekdays in November.\n\nSo adding up the weekdays:\n\nSeptember: 12\nOctober: 21\nNovember: 19\nTotal: 12 + 21 = 33, plus 19 is 52.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the days. Let me verify each month again.\n\nSeptember: 12 weekdays. Let me check again. From September 15 (Thu) to September 30 (Fri). The days are:\n\nThu (15), Fri (16), Sat (17), Sun (18), Mon (19), Tue (20), Wed (21), Thu (22), Fri (23), Sat (24), Sun (25), Mon (26), Tue (27), Wed (28), Thu (29), Fri (30). So the weekdays are the days that are not Saturday or Sunday. So from 15 to 30, the weekends are 17, 18, 24, 25. So total 4 weekends. So total days 16, minus 4 weekends = 12 weekdays. Correct.\n\nOctober: 21 weekdays. Let me check. October has 31 days. The first day is Saturday. So the first week has 1 weekday (Monday, day 3). Then each week has 5 weekdays. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4*5=20, plus the 3 days (day 29, 30, 31) which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So the only weekday is Monday (day 31). So 20 +1=21. Correct.\n\nNovember: 19 weekdays. From Nov 1 (Tue) to Nov 26 (Sat). The first three weeks (21 days) have 15 weekdays. Then the remaining 5 days (Nov 22-26) have 4 weekdays. So 15+4=19. Correct.\n\nSo total is 12 +21 +19 = 52. So the answer should be 52.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's calculate the total days (73) and subtract the number of weekends. So total days is 73. How many weekends are there?\n\nIn September: 4 weekends (as above)\nIn October: 4 weekends (since 31 days, 4 weeks and 3 days. 4 weekends (each week has 2 weekends). Wait, no. Wait, in October, the first day is Saturday. So the first week has Saturday and Sunday (2 days). Then each subsequent week has 2 weekend days. So 4 weeks would have 4*2=8 weekend days. But October has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days. So the last 3 days are Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So weekends are 2 (Saturday and Sunday) in the last partial week. So total weekends in October: 4*2 + 2 = 10? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, if there are 4 full weeks (28 days), then 4*2=8 weekend days. Then the remaining 3 days (days 29-31) are Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So that's 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). So total weekends in October is 8 + 2 = 10. So 10 weekend days.\n\nIn November: from Nov 1 (Tue) to Nov 26 (Sat). How many weekends? Let's count. The weekends are Saturday and Sunday. Let's see:\n\nIn the first three weeks (Nov 1-21), there are 3 weekends. Each week has 2 weekend days. So 3*2=6. Then the remaining 5 days (Nov 22-26) include Saturday (26th) and Sunday (27th, but 27th is beyond the end date). Wait, the end date is Nov 26, which is Saturday. So in the remaining 5 days"], [74, "Is 2055 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2055 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2055. First, divide 2055 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2055 minus 2000 is 55. 55 divided by 4 is 13.75. So 2055 divided by 4 is 513.75. That means 2055 is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should check again. Let me add 4 to 2055: 2055 + 4 = 2059. So 2055 is not a multiple of 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, since it's not divisible by 4, it can't be a leap year. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm. 2055 divided by 4: 4 times 513 is 2052. 2055 minus 2052 is 3. So remainder 3. So yes, not divisible by 4. Therefore, regardless of whether it's a century year or not, since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. \n\nWait, but 2055 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So even if it were divisible by 4, but since it's not a century year, it would be a leap year. But since it's not divisible by 4, it's automatically not a leap year. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [74, "Count forward 46 days from Wednesday, February 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 46 days after Wednesday, February 2, 2022. Hmm, so first, I should figure out the date 46 days later, and then determine the weekday.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to calculate the weekday without knowing the exact date? Because adding days can be done by considering how many weeks and extra days there are. Since a week has 7 days, 46 divided by 7 gives 6 weeks and 4 days. So if I start on a Wednesday, adding 6 weeks would still be Wednesday, and then adding 4 more days would take me to Sunday. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, let me check. Let's break it down. 46 divided by 7 is 6 with a remainder of 4. So 6 weeks is 42 days, and then 4 more days. So starting from Wednesday, adding 4 days: Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this by actually counting the days. Let me try to check the actual dates. February 2, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let's count 46 days forward.\n\nFirst, February has 28 days in 2022 because it's not a leap year. So from February 2, adding 28 days would take me to March 1, 2022. Wait, no. Wait, February 2 plus 28 days would be March 1? Wait, February 2 plus 28 days: February has 28 days, so from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days. Then adding 2 more days would be March 1. Wait, no. Wait, if I start on February 2, then adding 28 days would be February 2 + 28 days. Let me count:\n\nFebruary 2 + 1 day is February 3, ..., up to February 28 is 26 days later. Then March 1 is 27th day, March 2 is 28th, March 3 is 29th. Wait, so 28 days after February 2 would be March 2? Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nStarting from February 2, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count the days:\n\nFirst, February has 28 days in 2022. So from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since 28 - 2 = 26). Then March has 31 days, April has 30, May 31, etc. But maybe it's easier to just count the days in weeks.\n\nAlternatively, since 46 days is 6 weeks and 4 days, as I thought before. So adding 6 weeks (42 days) would bring me to the same day of the week, Wednesday. Then adding 4 days: Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 Friday, +3 Saturday, +4 Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday.\n\nBut maybe I should check with an actual calendar. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use another method. Let's check the actual date 46 days after February 2, 2022.\n\nFebruary 2, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let's count 46 days:\n\nFirst, February has 28 days. So from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days. Then March has 31 days. So adding 26 days (to reach February 28) plus 20 days in March would be 46 days. Wait, 26 + 20 = 46. So 26 days later is February 28, then 20 days into March. March 20th? Wait, March 1 is day 27, March 2 is 28, ..., March 20 is 26 + 20 = 46 days. So the date would be March 20, 2022. Now, what day of the week is March 20, 2022?\n\nBut how do I know that? Well, if February 2 is a Wednesday, then February 28 is 26 days later. 26 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Wednesday: Wednesday + 5 days is Monday. Wait, Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 Friday, +3 Saturday, +4 Sunday, +5 Monday. So February 28, 2022 is a Monday. Then March 1 is Tuesday, March 2 is Wednesday, March 3 is Thursday, March 4 is Friday, March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday, March 7 is Monday, March 8 is Tuesday, March 9 is Wednesday, March 10 is Thursday, March 11 is Friday, March 12 is Saturday, March 13 is Sunday, March 14 is Monday, March 15 is Tuesday, March 16 is Wednesday, March 17 is Thursday, March 18 is Friday, March 19 is Saturday, March 20 is Sunday. So March 20 is a Sunday. Therefore, the answer is Sunday. That matches my initial calculation. So the answer is Sunday.", "Sunday"], [74, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Reply with the numerical value.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, December 4, 2022, to Saturday, January 14, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates. Wait, the start date is Sunday, December 4, 2022, and the end date is Saturday, January 14, 2022. Wait, but January 14 is after December 4, so the period is from December 4 to January 14. But wait, the user said \"from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)\". So I need to count all the days between those two dates, including both, and then subtract the weekends.\n\nBut first, I need to make sure that the dates are correct. Let me check the actual dates. December 4, 2022 is a Sunday. Then, January 14, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, but wait, 2022 is a non-leap year. Let me confirm the days of the week for those dates. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to break it down into months. Let's see: from December 4 to December 31, then January 1 to January 14.\n\nFirst, December 4 is a Sunday. Let's count the days in December from December 4 to December 31. December has 31 days. So from December 4 to December 31 inclusive, that's 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days. Wait, 31 minus 4 is 27, plus 1 is 28 days. But wait, December 4 is included, so from Dec 4 to Dec 31 is 28 days. But how many of those are business days?\n\nBut wait, December 4 is a Sunday. So the next day, December 5 is a Monday. So in December, starting from Dec 4 (Sunday), the business days would be Monday (Dec 5) through Friday (Dec 9), then again Monday (Dec 12) through Friday (Dec 16), and so on. Wait, but I need to check each week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the number of weekends. But first, let's find the total number of days between Dec 4 and Jan 14 inclusive.\n\nWait, but the start date is Dec 4, and the end date is Jan 14. Let me calculate the total days between them. Let's see:\n\nFrom Dec 4 to Dec 31: 31 - 4 = 27 days, but since Dec 4 is included, it's 28 days. Then from Jan 1 to Jan 14 is 14 days. So total days is 28 + 14 = 42 days. But wait, that would be from Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive. Wait, but if Dec 4 is day 1, then Dec 5 is day 2, etc. So total days between Dec 4 and Jan 14 inclusive is 42 days. Let me check that again. December has 31 days. So from Dec 4 to Dec 31 is 28 days (including Dec 4). Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total is 28 + 14 = 42 days. So total days is 42.\n\nNow, out of these 42 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nBut I need to figure out how many Saturdays and Sundays are in this period. Let's start with the first day, which is Sunday, Dec 4. So Dec 4 is a Sunday. Then Dec 5 is Monday, Dec 6 Tuesday, Dec 7 Wednesday, Dec 8 Thursday, Dec 9 Friday. Then Dec 10 is Saturday, Dec 11 is Sunday. So in December, the weekends would be Dec 4 (Sunday), Dec 11 (Sunday), Dec 18 (Saturday?), wait, wait, let me check.\n\nWait, Dec 4 is Sunday. Then Dec 5 is Monday. So the first weekend in December is Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 is Monday. Wait, no, the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. So the first weekend would be Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 is Monday. Wait, no, the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. So the first weekend in December would be Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 3 (Saturday)? Wait, but Dec 4 is the start date. Wait, Dec 4 is Sunday. So the previous Saturday would be Dec 3, 2022. But since the start date is Dec 4, the first weekend in the period is Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 is Monday. Wait, no, the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. So Dec 4 is Sunday, so the previous Saturday is Dec 3. But since the period starts on Dec 4, the first weekend day in the period is Dec 4 (Sunday). Then the next weekend would be Dec 11 (Sunday) and Dec 12 (Monday). Wait, no, Dec 11 is Sunday, Dec 12 is Monday. Then Dec 18 is Saturday, Dec 19 is Sunday. Then Dec 25 is Saturday, Dec 26 is Sunday. Then Jan 1 is Saturday, Jan 2 is Sunday. Wait, but the end date is Jan 14, which is a Saturday. So let's list all the weekends in the period from Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive.\n\nFirst, Dec 4 is Sunday. Then Dec 11 is Sunday. Then Dec 18 is Saturday? Wait, Dec 4 is Sunday. Dec 5 is Monday. Dec 6 Tuesday, Dec 7 Wednesday, Dec 8 Thursday, Dec 9 Friday. Dec 10 Saturday, Dec 11 Sunday. Then Dec 12 Monday, Dec 13 Tuesday, Dec 14 Wednesday, Dec 15 Thursday, Dec 16 Friday. Dec 17 Saturday, Dec 18 Sunday. Then Dec 19 Monday, Dec 20 Tuesday, Dec 21 Wednesday, Dec 22 Thursday, Dec 23 Friday. Dec 24 Saturday, Dec 25 Sunday. Then Dec 26 Monday, Dec 27 Tuesday, Dec 28 Wednesday, Dec 29 Thursday, Dec 30 Friday. Dec 31 Saturday. Then Jan 1 is Sunday, Jan 2 is Monday, Jan 3 Tuesday, Jan 4 Wednesday, Jan 5 Thursday, Jan 6 Friday. Jan 7 Saturday, Jan 8 Sunday. Jan 9 Monday, Jan 10 Tuesday, Jan 11 Wednesday, Jan 12 Thursday, Jan 13 Friday, Jan 14 Saturday.\n\nSo the weekends in the period are:\n\nDec 4 (Sunday), Dec 11 (Sunday), Dec 18 (Sunday), Dec 25 (Sunday), Jan 1 (Sunday), Jan 8 (Sunday), Jan 15 (Sunday) but wait, the end date is Jan 14, so Jan 15 is not included. So the weekends in the period are:\n\nDec 4, Dec 11, Dec 18, Dec 25, Jan 1, Jan 8. Wait, but Dec 31 is Saturday, which is included in the period? Wait, the period is from Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive. So Dec 31 is included. So Dec 31 is Saturday. So that's another weekend day. Then Jan 1 is Sunday. So the weekends are:\n\nDec 4 (Sunday), Dec 11 (Sunday), Dec 18 (Sunday), Dec 25 (Sunday), Dec 31 (Saturday), Jan 1 (Sunday), Jan 8 (Sunday). Wait, but Dec 31 is Saturday. So that's another weekend. Let me check again.\n\nLet me list all the weekends in the period:\n\nStarting from Dec 4 (Sunday):\n\n- Dec 4 (Sunday)\n- Dec 11 (Sunday)\n- Dec 18 (Sunday)\n- Dec 25 (Sunday)\n- Dec 31 (Saturday)\n- Jan 1 (Sunday)\n- Jan 8 (Sunday)\n\nWait, but Dec 31 is Saturday. So that's a Saturday. Then Jan 1 is Sunday. So that's two more weekends. So total of 7 weekends? Let me count again:\n\nDec 4 (Sunday), Dec 11 (Sunday), Dec 18 (Sunday), Dec 25 (Sunday), Dec 31 (Saturday), Jan 1 (Sunday), Jan 8 (Sunday). That's 7 weekend days. Wait, but Dec 31 is Saturday, which is included. So that's 7 weekend days. So total days is 42, minus 7 weekends, so 42 - 7 = 35 business days. But wait, let me check again. Because maybe I missed some weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of Saturdays and Sundays in the period.\n\nLet me check each month:\n\nDecember:\n\nFrom Dec 4 to Dec 31:\n\nDec 4 is Sunday. So the weekends in December are:\n\nDec 4 (Sunday), Dec 11 (Sunday), Dec 18 (Sunday), Dec 25 (Sunday), and Dec 31 (Saturday). So that's 5 weekend days in December.\n\nJanuary:\n\nFrom Jan 1 to Jan 14:\n\nJan 1 is Sunday, Jan 2 is Monday, ..., Jan 7 is Saturday, Jan 8 is Sunday. So the weekends in January are Jan 1 (Sunday), Jan 7 (Saturday), Jan 8 (Sunday). Wait, but Jan 7 is Saturday, and Jan 8 is Sunday. So that's two weekends in January: Jan 1 (Sunday), Jan 7 (Saturday), Jan 8 (Sunday). Wait, but Jan 7 is Saturday, so that's one weekend day (Saturday), and Jan 8 is Sunday. So that's two weekend days in January. Wait, but Jan 7 is Saturday, which is included in the period (since the end date is Jan 14). So in January, the weekends are Jan 1 (Sunday), Jan 7 (Saturday), Jan 8 (Sunday). So that's three weekend days in January.\n\nWait, but that would make total weekends 5 (Dec) + 3 (Jan) = 8. But earlier I thought 7. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's list all the weekends again:\n\nDecember:\n\n- Dec 4 (Sunday)\n- Dec 11 (Sunday)\n- Dec 18 (Sunday)\n- Dec 25 (Sunday)\n- Dec 31 (Saturday)\n\nThat's 5.\n\nJanuary:\n\n- Jan 1 (Sunday)\n- Jan 7 (Saturday)\n- Jan 8 (Sunday)\n\nThat's 3. So total 5 + 3 = 8 weekend days. So total days is 42, so 42 - 8 = 34 business days. But this contradicts the previous count. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I missed a weekend in December. Let me check again. Dec 31 is Saturday. So that's one. Then in December, the weekends are:\n\nDec 4 (Sunday), Dec 11 (Sunday), Dec 18 (Sunday), Dec 25 (Sunday), Dec 31 (Saturday). That's 5. Then in January, Jan 1 (Sunday), Jan 7 (Saturday), Jan 8 (Sunday). That's 3. So total 8. So 42 - 8 = 34 business days. But earlier I thought 7 weekends, but that was wrong. So the correct number is 8 weekends. Therefore, 42 - 8 = 34 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check the dates again. Let's list all the days from Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive and count the weekends.\n\nStarting with Dec 4 (Sunday):\n\nDec 4: Sunday (weekend)\nDec 5: Monday (business)\nDec 6: Tuesday\nDec 7: Wednesday\nDec 8: Thursday\nDec 9: Friday\nDec 10: Saturday (weekend)\nDec 11: Sunday (weekend)\nDec 12: Monday\nDec 13: Tuesday\nDec 14: Wednesday\nDec 15: Thursday\nDec 16: Friday\nDec 17: Saturday (weekend)\nDec 18: Sunday (weekend)\nDec 19: Monday\nDec 20: Tuesday\nDec 21: Wednesday\nDec 22: Thursday\nDec 23: Friday\nDec 24: Saturday (weekend)\nDec 25: Sunday (weekend)\nDec 26: Monday\nDec 27: Tuesday\nDec 28: Wednesday\nDec 29: Thursday\nDec 30: Friday\nDec 31: Saturday (weekend)\nJan 1: Sunday (weekend)\nJan 2: Monday\nJan 3: Tuesday\nJan 4: Wednesday\nJan 5: Thursday\nJan 6: Friday\nJan 7: Saturday (weekend)\nJan 8: Sunday (weekend)\nJan 9: Monday\nJan 10: Tuesday\nJan 11: Wednesday\nJan 12: Thursday\nJan 13: Friday\nJan 14: Saturday (weekend)\n\nNow, let's count the weekends:\n\nDec 4, Dec 10, Dec 11, Dec 17, Dec 18, Dec 24, Dec 25, Dec 31, Jan 1, Jan 7, Jan 8, Jan 14. Wait, that's 12 weekend days. Wait, but that's conflicting with previous counts. What's going on here?\n\nWait, the user said the end date is Saturday, January 14, 2022. So Jan 14 is included. So in the list above, Jan 14 is Saturday, which is a weekend. So that's another weekend day. So that's 12 weekend days. But that can't be right because the total days are 42. So 42 - 12 = 30 business days. But this is conflicting with previous counts. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the list above shows that from Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive, there are 42 days. Let me count the number of weekends in that list.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nWeekends are:\n\nDec 4 (Sunday)\nDec 10 (Saturday)\nDec 11 (Sunday)\nDec 17 (Saturday)\nDec 18 (Sunday)\nDec 24 (Saturday)\nDec 25 (Sunday)\nDec 31 (Saturday)\nJan 1 (Sunday)\nJan 7 (Saturday)\nJan 8 (Sunday)\nJan 14 (Saturday)\n\nThat's 12 weekend days. So 12 weekends. Therefore, 42 - 12 = 30 business days. But that's conflicting with previous counts. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe the total number of days is not 42. Let me check again. From Dec 4 to Jan 14 inclusive. Let's calculate the number of days between Dec 4 and Jan 14.\n\nDecember has 31 days. So from Dec 4 to Dec 31 is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days. Then January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total is 28 + 14 = 42 days. That's correct. So 42 days total. But according to the list above, there are 12 weekend days. So 42 - 12 = 30 business days. But that seems low. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the list of weekends includes Dec 4, Dec 10, Dec 11, Dec 17, Dec 18, Dec 24, Dec 25, Dec 31, Jan 1, Jan 7, Jan 8, Jan 14. That's 12 days. So 12 weekends. So 42 - 12 = 30 business days. But that seems like a lot of weekends. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, Dec 4 is Sunday. Then Dec 5 is Monday. So the first weekend is Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 5 is Monday. Wait, no, the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. So the first weekend in the period is Dec 4 (Sunday) and Dec 3 (Saturday), but Dec 3 is not included. So the first weekend day in the period is Dec 4 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is Dec 11 (Sunday) and Dec 10 (Saturday). Then Dec 17 (Saturday) and Dec 18 (Sunday). Then Dec 24 (Saturday) and Dec 25 (Sunday). Then Dec 31 (Saturday) and Jan 1 (Sunday). Then Jan 7 (Saturday) and Jan 8 (Sunday). Then Jan 14 (Saturday). Wait, but Jan 14 is Saturday, so that's another weekend day. So that's 12 weekend days. So 12 weekends. So 42 - 12 = 30 business days. But that seems like a lot of weekends. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks between the dates. From Dec 4 to Jan 14 is 42 days. 42 divided by 7 is 6 weeks. So 6 weeks would have 6*2 = 12 weekend days. So that matches. So 6 weeks, 12 weekend days. So 42 - 12 = 30 business days. So the answer should be 30. But I need to make sure"], [74, "On which weekday did June 26, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 26, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, let me check that. If I remember correctly, 2022 started on a Sunday. Let me confirm that. \n\nWait, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because January 1, 2021 was a Friday? Wait, no, I need to be careful here. Let me try to recall. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. July 4, 2022: if I count backwards, June has 30 days. So June 26 is 4 days before July 4. If July 4 is a Monday, then June 26 would be 4 days earlier. So subtracting 4 days from Monday: Monday minus 1 day is Sunday, minus 2 is Saturday, minus 3 is Friday, minus 4 is Thursday. So June 26 would be a Thursday? But wait, I'm not sure if July 4, 2022 was actually a Monday. Maybe I should check that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then June 1 is Wednesday. Then adding days: June 1 (Wed), June 2 (Thu), June 3 (Fri), June 4 (Sat), June 5 (Sun), June 6 (Mon), June 7 (Tue), June 8 (Wed). Wait, that seems off. Wait, if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 8 would be the next Wednesday. So June 8 is Wednesday. Then June 15 is Wednesday, June 22 is Wednesday, and June 29 is Wednesday. So June 26 would be three days before June 29. So June 26 would be Sunday? Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming June 1 was a Wednesday. Let me check. If I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then June 26 would be 4 days before that. So July 4 minus 4 days is June 30, which would be Sunday. Then June 26 is 4 days before June 30, which would be Thursday. But if June 30 is Sunday, then June 26 is Thursday. But if June 1 is Wednesday, then June 26 would be Sunday. There's a contradiction here. So one of my assumptions must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check a different known date. Let me think. For example, I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If June 1 is Wednesday, then June 8 is Wednesday, June 15 is Wednesday, June 22 is Wednesday, and June 29 is Wednesday. So June 26 would be three days before June 29, which would be Sunday. But if July 4 is Monday, then June 30 is Sunday, so June 26 is Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's use Zeller's Congruence. The formula for Zeller's Congruence for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for June 26, 2022, m is 6, and the year is 2022. So q is 26, m is 6, K is 22, J is 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (26 + floor((13*(6 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nfloor((13*7)/5) = floor(91/5) = floor(18.2) = 18\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n26 + 18 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 26 + 18 is 44, plus 22 is 66, plus 5 is 71, plus 5 is 76, plus 100 is 176.\n\nNow 176 mod 7. Let's divide 176 by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 176 mod 7 is 1. \n\nSo h = 1. According to Zeller's Congruence, h=1 corresponds to Sunday. Therefore, June 26, 2022 was a Sunday. But earlier when I thought July 4 was Monday, that would imply June 26 was Thursday. But according to Zeller's Congruence, it's Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming July 4 was a Monday. Let me check that. If June 26 is Sunday, then June 27 is Monday, June 28 Tuesday, June 29 Wednesday, June 30 Thursday. July 1 is Friday. July 4 would be Monday. So that's correct. So July 4 is Monday. So that aligns with the Zeller's result. Therefore, June 26 is Sunday. So my initial calculation where I thought June 1 was Wednesday must have been wrong. Let me check that again. If June 26 is Sunday, then June 1 is 25 days before. Let's count 25 days. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So if June 26 is Sunday, then June 1 is Sunday minus 4 days, which is Wednesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. That matches. So that's correct. Therefore, June 26, 2022 was a Sunday.", "Sunday"], [74, "Name the day of the week for 06/29/2022.

But I need to make sure that my reference date is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me see if that helps. Wait, December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me count backwards from there. But that might take longer. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think. If I can find a known date in 2022, maybe I can use that.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 was not a leap year. So February had 28 days. Let me try to find a date that I know. For example, I remember that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then April 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Fridays. Then May 6, 13, 20, 27 would be Fridays. June 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 would be Fridays. So June 3 was a Friday. Then June 6 would be Monday. Wait, June 3 is Friday, so June 4 is Saturday, June 5 is Sunday, June 6 is Monday. So June 6 is a Monday. Then June 13 is Monday, June 20 is Monday, June 27 is Monday. Then June 29 would be three days after June 27. So June 27 is Monday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 29 is Wednesday. Wait, that would make June 29 a Wednesday. But earlier when I counted from July 4 (Monday) backwards, I got Saturday. There's a contradiction here. So which one is correct?\n\nHmm, maybe my assumption that April 1, 2022 was a Friday is wrong. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me try to use Zeller's Congruence. Zeller's formula for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for the given date of June 29, 2022, m is 6, and the year is 2022. So q is 29, m is 6, K is 22, J is 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (29 + floor((13*(6 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nfloor((13*7)/5) = floor(91/5) = floor(18.2) = 18\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n29 + 18 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 29 + 18 is 47, plus 22 is 69, plus 5 is 74, plus 5 is 79, plus 100 is 179.\n\nNow 179 mod 7. Let's divide 179 by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 179 - 175 is 4. So h = 4.\n\nAccording to Zeller's Congruence, h=4 corresponds to Thursday (since 0=Saturday, 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, 4=Wednesday, 5=Thursday, 6=Friday). Wait, no, wait. Wait the formula says h is 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, 3 = Tuesday, 4 = Wednesday, 5 = Thursday, 6 = Friday. So h=4 is Wednesday. But according to my previous calculation, when I thought April 1 was Friday, I got June 29 as Wednesday. But when I counted from July 4 (Monday) backwards, I thought June 29 was Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula is h = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a term. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal formula: h = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the terms are:\n\nq = 29\n\nfloor(13*(6+1)/5) = floor(91/5) = 18\n\nK = 22\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo total is 29 + 18 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 179. 179 divided by 7 is 25*7=175, remainder 4. So h=4. Which is Wednesday. So according to Zeller's Congruence, June 29, 2022 is a Wednesday. But earlier when I thought July 4 was Monday, and counted back, I thought June 29 was Saturday. That must have been a mistake in that calculation. Let me check that again.\n\nIf July 4 is Monday, then July 4 is day 0. Then July 3 is Sunday, July 2 is Saturday, July 1 is Friday. June 30 is Friday, June 29 is Thursday. Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me recount. If July 4 is Monday, then July 4 is Monday. So July 4 minus 1 day is July 3 (Sunday), minus 2 days is July 2 (Saturday), minus 3 days is July 1 (Friday), minus 4 days is June 30 (Thursday), minus 5 days is June 29 (Wednesday). Oh! So that would make June 29 a Wednesday. So that matches the Zeller's result. So earlier when I thought June 29 was Saturday, I must have miscalculated. So that was my mistake. So the correct answer is Wednesday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that June 27, 2022 was a Monday. If that's the case, then June 28 is Tuesday, June 29 is Wednesday. So that matches. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Wednesday.", "Wednesday"], [74, "What day of the week was May 31, 2022? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to find out what day of the week May 31, 2022 was. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can use as a reference. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but maybe I should check that again. Let me think. If I recall correctly, 2022 started on a Saturday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, if I can count the number of days from January 1 to May 31, I can figure out the day of the week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know for sure. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8, 2022 was also a Saturday. Then, adding months, maybe I can count. But maybe that's too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's break down the months from January to May. January has 31 days, February has 28 days (since 2022 is not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, and May has 31 days. But since we're going up to May 31, maybe I need to calculate the total days from January 1 to May 31, then find the remainder when divided by 7 to determine the day of the week.\n\nWait, but if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding days to get to May 31. Let's calculate the total days from January 1 to May 31. Let's see:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March 31, April 30, and May 31. Wait, but if we're going up to May 31, then the total days from January 1 to May 31 would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) = 31+28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 31 is 151 days. Wait, but that's from January 1 to May 31 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then adding 31 days would take us to January 31. Then adding 28 days would take us to February 28. Then adding 31 days would take us to March 31. Then adding 30 days to April 30, and then adding 31 days to May 31. Wait, but that would be 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 151 days. But if January 1 is day 1, then May 31 would be day 151. But since January 1 is a Saturday, then day 1 is Saturday. Then day 1 + 150 days would be May 31. Wait, because day 1 is January 1, so day 151 is May 31. So the number of days between January 1 and May 31 is 150 days. Wait, no, because if January 1 is day 1, then May 31 is day 151. So the difference between May 31 and January 1 is 150 days. So 150 days later. Now, since each week has 7 days, 150 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder gives the number of days ahead. Let's calculate 150 divided by 7. 7*21 is 147, so 150-147 is 3. So the remainder is 3. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 3 days would be Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean May 31 is a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. If that's correct, then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday, May 15, 22, 29. Then May 31 would be two days after May 29. So May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that would make May 31, 2022 a Tuesday. But I need to confirm if May 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday. How can I check that?\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method. Let's take a date I know for sure. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If May 31 is Tuesday, then June has 30 days. So June 1 is Wednesday. Then July 1 is a Friday. Wait, that doesn't align with July 4 being a Monday. Hmm, maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use an online calendar or a known reference. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, I think that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me think again. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday. Then January 15 is Saturday, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Saturday. February 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. May 7, 14, 21, 28. So May 28 is a Saturday. Then May 29 is Sunday, May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that would make May 31, 2022 a Tuesday. But I need to confirm if May 28 is indeed a Saturday. Let's check. If April 30 is a Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. Wait, April 30, 2022 was a Saturday? Let me think. April has 30 days. If April 30 is Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. But how do I know April 30 is Saturday? Let's go back. March 26 was a Saturday. March has 31 days, so March 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. March 31 is a Monday. Then April 1 is a Tuesday. Then April 1 is Tuesday. Then April 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. So April 29 is Tuesday. Then April 30 is Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So if April 29 is Tuesday, then April 30 is Wednesday. Then May 1 is Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, let's start over. If January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday. January 15 is Saturday. January 22 is Saturday. January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February 12 is Saturday. February 19 is Saturday. February 26 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday. March 12 is Saturday. March 19 is Saturday. March 26 is Saturday. March 27 is Sunday. March 28 is Monday. March 29 is Tuesday. March 30 is Wednesday. March 31 is Thursday. Then April 1 is Friday. April 8 is Friday. April 15 is Friday. April 22 is Friday. April 29 is Friday. Then April 30 is Saturday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday. May 15 is Sunday. May 22 is Sunday. May 29 is Sunday. Then May 30 is Monday. May 31 is Tuesday. So that would make May 31, 2022 a Tuesday. But earlier when I thought April 30 was Wednesday, that was a mistake. So according to this calculation, May 31 is Tuesday. But I need to check if January 1, 2022 was indeed a Saturday. Wait, I think that's correct. Because 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 started on a Saturday. Let me check that. 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 started on a Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, if 2021 started on a Monday, then the next year would start on a Tuesday if it's not a leap year. Wait, 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be one day later than January 1, 2021. So if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 started on a Tuesday. But I thought earlier that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. That must be wrong. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I confused the years. Let me check. For example, I know that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 was a leap year, so 366 days, which is 52 weeks and 2 days. So 2021 started on a Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 started on a Saturday. So that would mean January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So that's correct. So if that's the case, then my previous calculation is correct. So May 31, 2022 is Tuesday. But I need to make sure that the calculation of the days from January 1 to May 31 is correct. Let me recalculate the days from January 1 to May 31. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March 31, April 30, and May 31. Wait, but if I'm going from January 1 to May 31, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+31=151 days. So May 31 is the 151st day of the year. But if January 1 is day 1, then May 31 is day 151. So the number of days between January 1 and May 31 is 150 days. So 150 days later. Now, 150 divided by 7 is 21 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday (January 1) would be Saturday + 3 days = Tuesday. So that confirms that May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022 - what's the weekday? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022, and find out what day of the week that falls on. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 81 days. Since a week has 7 days, dividing 81 by 7 will give me the number of weeks and the remainder will tell me how many days I need to go back beyond those weeks. Let me do that calculation. 81 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 4 days. Because 11 times 7 is 77, and 81 minus 77 is 4. So, going back 81 days is the same as going back 11 weeks and 4 days. But since 11 weeks is exactly 77 days, which brings me back to the same day of the week, the key part is the 4 days backward.\n\nNow, starting from Tuesday, October 4, 2022. If I go back 4 days, what day would that be? Let's count. One day before Tuesday is Monday, two days before is Sunday, three days before is Saturday, and four days before is Friday. Wait, so going back 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday? But wait, maybe I should check that again. Let me count step by step.\n\nStarting from Tuesday, October 4, 2022:\n\n- 1 day before: Monday, October 3, 2022\n- 2 days before: Sunday, October 2, 2022\n- 3 days before: Saturday, September 30, 2022\n- 4 days before: Friday, September 29, 2022\n\nSo, that's four days back. Therefore, the weekday should be Friday. But wait, I need to make sure that the 81 days are correctly accounted for. Because sometimes when you count backward, you might have to check if the dates actually exist, especially across months and years. But since the original date is October 4, 2022, and we're going back 81 days, which is about 11 weeks and 4 days, the calculation should be straightforward. However, maybe I should verify by checking the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the day of the week for October 4, 2022. Wait, the problem says that the starting date is Tuesday, October 4, 2022. So that's given. So if I go back 81 days, which is 11 weeks and 4 days, then the day of the week would be 4 days before Tuesday. So Tuesday minus 4 days is Friday. But wait, maybe I should check if that's correct. Let me think again. If I go back one day, it's Monday. Two days back is Sunday. Three days back is Saturday. Four days back is Friday. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be Friday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another approach. Let's use an online calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. Alternatively, I can check the number of days in each month to ensure that going back 81 days is accurate. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from October 4, 2022. Let's count backward:\n\nOctober has 31 days. So October 4 minus 4 days is September 30. Then, going back 77 days (11 weeks) would take me back to September 30, 2022, minus 77 days. Wait, no. Wait, 81 days total. So if I go back 77 days (11 weeks), that would be September 30, 2022. Then, going back 4 more days from there would be September 26, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if I go back 81 days from October 4, 2022, then subtracting 77 days (11 weeks) would take me to October 4 minus 77 days. Let's calculate that. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 31 days is September 4, 2022. Then subtract another 31 days (for September) would be August 4, 2022. Wait, that's 31 + 31 = 62 days. Then subtract another 15 days (October 4 minus 77 days is 77-62=15 days). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's try to count backward step by step. Starting from October 4, 2022:\n\nGoing back 1 day: September 30, 2022 (Monday)\nGoing back 2 days: September 29, 2022 (Sunday)\nGoing back 3 days: September 28, 2022 (Saturday)\nGoing back 4 days: September 27, 2022 (Friday)\nWait, but that's only 4 days back. But the total is 81 days. So maybe I need to go back 81 days in total. But if I go back 4 days, that's 4 days, but the rest is 77 days. Wait, but 77 days is 11 weeks, so that would bring me back to the same day of the week. So if I go back 4 days from Tuesday, that's Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But I need to make sure that the 81 days are correctly accounted for. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 4, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let's check what day of the week October 4, 2022 was. Wait, the problem says it's Tuesday, so that's given. So if I go back 81 days, which is 11 weeks and 4 days, then the day of the week would be 4 days before Tuesday. So Tuesday minus 4 days is Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But I need to make sure that the calculation of 81 days is correct. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. So if I subtract 11 weeks (77 days) from October 4, 2022, that would be October 4 minus 77 days. Let's calculate that. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 31 days is September 4, 2022. Then subtract another 31 days (September has 30 days, so September 4 minus 30 days is August 4, 2022. Wait, that's 31 + 30 = 61 days. Then subtract another 16 days (77 - 61 = 16) to get to August 4 minus 16 days. August has 31 days, so August 4 minus 16 days is July 18, 2022. Wait, but that's 77 days back. Then adding 4 days to that would be July 22, 2022. Wait, but that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days and count backward step by step. Let's try that. Starting from October 4, 2022:\n\nGoing back 81 days. Let's break it down into months. October has 31 days, so going back 31 days would take me to September 4, 2022. Then another 31 days would take me to August 4, 2022. That's 62 days. Then 81 - 62 = 19 days. So going back 19 days from August 4, 2022. August has 31 days, so August 4 minus 19 days is July 16, 2022. Wait, but that's 81 days back. But then, what day of the week is July 16, 2022? Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. However, I don't have the actual calendar here, but I know that October 4, 2022 is a Tuesday. So if I go back 81 days, which is 11 weeks and 4 days, then the day of the week should be 4 days before Tuesday, which is Friday. But if I go back 81 days to July 16, 2022, what day is that? Let me think. Wait, maybe I should check the number of days between July 16, 2022 and October 4, 2022. Let's see:\n\nFrom July 16 to July 31: 16 days (July has 31 days, so 31 - 16 = 15 days left, but including July 16, it's 16 days? Wait, no. If I go from July 16 to July 31, that's 15 days later. Then August has 31 days, so from July 16 to August 16 is 31 days. Then September has 30 days, so from July 16 to September 16 is 31 + 30 = 61 days. Then October 16 is another 31 days. So from July 16 to October 16 is 61 + 31 = 92 days. But October 4 is 12 days before October 16, so 92 - 12 = 80 days. Wait, that's 80 days. But I thought it was 81 days. Hmm, so maybe my calculation is off. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the steps. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that October 4, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let's check what day of the week July 16, 2022 was. If I go back 81 days from October 4, 2022, that would be July 16, 2022. Let's calculate the number of days between July 16 and October 4. July has 31 days, so from July 16 to July 31 is 15 days. August has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to September 16. Then September has 30 days, so adding 30 days brings us to October 16. But October 4 is 12 days before October 16, so total days from July 16 to October 4 is 15 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) - 12 (October) = 15 + 31 + 30 - 12 = 64 days. Wait, that's 64 days. But that's not 81. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, my previous calculation must be wrong. So maybe my initial approach of subtracting 11 weeks and 4 days is correct, but the step-by-step month calculation is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let's use the fact that 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. So if I subtract 11 weeks (77 days) from October 4, 2022, that would be October 4 minus 77 days. Let's calculate that. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 31 days is September 4. Then subtract another 31 days (September has 30 days, so September 4 minus 30 days is August 4. Wait, that's 31 + 30 = 61 days. Then subtract another 16 days (77 - 61 = 16) to get to July 18, 2022. Wait, August 4 minus 16 days is July 18. So that's 77 days back. Then adding 4 days to July 18 would be July 22. But that's 81 days back. So July 22, 2022. Now, what day of the week is July 22, 2022? If October 4, 2022 is a Tuesday, then July 22 would be 81 days before. Let's check the number of days between July 22 and October 4. July has 31 days, so from July 22 to July 31 is 9 days. August has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to September 22. September has 30 days, so adding 30 days brings us to October 22. Then October 4 is 18 days before October 22. So total days from July 22 to October 4 is 9 + 31 + 30 - 18 = 9 + 31 + 12 = 52 days. Wait, that's not 81. So clearly, there's a mistake here. I must be miscalculating the days. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's use the fact that each week has 7 days, so 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. Therefore, going back 81 days from Tuesday would be the same as going back 4 days from Tuesday, which is Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But why is there a discrepancy in the other method? Maybe I made a mistake in the step-by-step calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual day of the week for July 22, 2022. If I can recall, July 22, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, but how? If October 4, 2022 is a Tuesday, then going back 81 days would be 11 weeks and 4 days, so 4 days before Tuesday is Friday. Therefore, July 22, 2022 would be a Friday. But if I check the actual calendar, July 22, 2022 was indeed a Friday. So that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is Friday.", "Friday"], [74, "If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so I need to figure out the day of the week for March 25, given that January 1st is a Saturday.\n\nFirst, I should check how many days are in each month up to March. Since we're starting from January 1st, which is a Saturday, I need to count the days from January 1st to March 25th. Let me break it down month by month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is a Saturday. Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. But since the first day of the year is given as Saturday, maybe we can assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed to not depend on that? Wait, but March 25th is in the same year, so if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. Maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days, which would affect the total number of days from January 1st to March 25th. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check if the answer is the same in both cases? Or maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Let me think. The problem says \"the first day of the year was a Saturday\"\u2014so if it's a leap year, then February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. Wait, but that's not possible. For example, if it's a leap year, then the total days from January 1st to March 25th would be 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 25 (March) = 85 days. If it's not a leap year, it's 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. So the day of the week would be different. But the problem doesn't mention leap year. Hmm. Maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to not require knowing about leap years. Wait, but how can that be? Let me check the actual dates. Wait, March 25th is in the same year. So if the first day of the year is a Saturday, then the number of days from January 1st to March 25th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (March) = 84 days. Wait, but if it's a leap year, then February has 29 days, so 31 + 29 + 25 = 85 days. But the problem doesn't specify. However, since the problem is given without any mention of leap year, maybe it's safe to assume that it's a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but that's not possible. Let me check. Let's assume it's a non-leap year. So total days from Jan 1 to March 25 is 84 days. Now, since January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 84 days. Since 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 days later would be the same day of the week. So March 25 would be a Saturday? Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, wait. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is also Saturday, and so on. So adding 7 days, the same day. So 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. So March 25 would be a Saturday. But that seems too easy. But maybe that's correct. Wait, but let me check again. Let me count the days step by step. January has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 would be 3 days after Saturday, which is Tuesday. Then February has 28 days (non-leap year), so March 1 is 28 days after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 would be Tuesday. Then March 25 is 24 days after March 1. 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Tuesday would be Friday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. Wait, so where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, first approach: total days from Jan 1 to March 25 is 84 days. 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks. So same day. But that would mean March 25 is Saturday. But the second approach, breaking down the months, gives Friday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check the second approach again. January 1 is Saturday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then February has 28 days, so March 1 is 28 days after February 1. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also Tuesday. Then March 25 is 24 days after March 1. 24 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 3 days. So Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. So March 25 would be Friday. But according to the first approach, 84 days later is same day. But that's conflicting. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, the first approach is wrong. Because the total days from Jan 1 to March 25 is not 84 days. Wait, let's count again. January has 31 days. So from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so from Feb 1 to Feb 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 25 is 25 days. So total days from Jan 1 to March 25 is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but that's correct. But if Jan 1 is day 0 (Saturday), then day 84 would be 84 days later. But if 84 is divisible by 7, then it's the same day. But according to the second approach, March 25 is Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the approaches is wrong. Let me check the second approach again. Let's take a specific example. Let's take January 1 as Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday. January 15 is Saturday. January 22 is Saturday. January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February 12 is Saturday. February 19 is Saturday. February 26 is Saturday. Then March 5 is Saturday. March 12 is Saturday. March 19 is Saturday. March 26 is Saturday. So March 25 is one day before March 26, which is Saturday. So March 25 would be Friday. So that's correct. So according to this, March 25 is Friday. But according to the first approach, 84 days later is same day. But that's not possible. Wait, why is that? Because if Jan 1 is day 0 (Saturday), then day 84 is 84 days later. But if March 25 is 84 days after Jan 1, then it's the same day. But according to the step-by-step counting, March 25 is Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the calculations is wrong. Let me check the total days again. From Jan 1 to March 25: January has 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so from Feb 1 to Feb 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 25 is 25 days. So total is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. But if March 25 is 84 days after Jan 1, then that would be 84 days later. But according to the step-by-step, March 25 is Friday. But if Jan 1 is Saturday, then 84 days later is also Saturday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the way the days are counted. Because when you count the number of days from Jan 1 to March 25, inclusive or exclusive? Wait, if Jan 1 is day 1, then March 25 is day 84. But if Jan 1 is day 0, then March 25 is day 83. Wait, maybe that's the problem. Let me clarify. If Jan 1 is day 0 (Saturday), then Jan 2 is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between Jan 1 and March 25 is 84 days. But if you add 84 days to Jan 1, you get March 25. But if you add 84 days to Saturday, you get Saturday again. But according to the step-by-step, March 25 is Friday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step. Let me check again. Let's list the dates:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday.\n\nJanuary 8: Saturday (7 days later).\n\nJanuary 15: Saturday.\n\nJanuary 22: Saturday.\n\nJanuary 29: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 5: Saturday (29 + 7 = 36 days later).\n\nFebruary 12: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 19: Saturday.\n\nFebruary 26: Saturday.\n\nMarch 5: Saturday (26 + 7 = 33 days later).\n\nMarch 12: Saturday.\n\nMarch 19: Saturday.\n\nMarch 26: Saturday.\n\nSo March 25 is one day before March 26, which is Saturday. Therefore, March 25 is Friday. So that's correct. But according to the total days, 84 days later would be Saturday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because the total number of days from Jan 1 to March 25 is 84 days, but if you count from Jan 1 (day 0) to March 25 (day 84), then the number of days between them is 84 days. However, when you add 84 days to Jan 1, you get March 25. But if Jan 1 is Saturday, then adding 84 days (which is 12 weeks) would be Saturday again. But according to the step-by-step, March 25 is Friday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the total days calculation. Let me count the days again. January has 31 days. So from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so from Feb 1 to Feb 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 25 is 25 days. So total is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. But if Jan 1 is day 0, then March 25 is day 84. But if you add 84 days to Jan 1, you get March 25. But according to the step-by-step, March 25 is Friday. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when you count the days from Jan 1 to March 25, you need to include both the start and end dates? Or not? Wait, if Jan 1 is day 1, then March 25 is day 84. But if you add 83 days to Jan 1, you get March 25. Because from Jan 1 to Jan 2 is 1 day later. So the number of days between Jan 1 and March 25 is 84 - 1 = 83 days. Therefore, if you add 83 days to Jan 1 (Saturday), you get March 25. 83 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 6 days. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. That matches the step-by-step. So the mistake was in the initial calculation of the total days. The correct number of days between Jan 1 and March 25 is 83 days, not 84. Because if you count from Jan 1 (day 1) to March 25 (day 84), the number of days between them is 83. Therefore, adding 83 days to Saturday gives Friday. So that's the correct answer. Therefore, March 25 is Friday.\n\nSo the answer is Friday.", "Friday"], [74, "Determine the day of the month for the third Thursday in November 2022. Express your answer as a number.

Hmm, first, maybe I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Thursday would be the 3rd. Because November 1 is Tuesday, so the next day is Wednesday (2nd), then Thursday is the 3rd. So the first Thursday is the 3rd. Then the second Thursday would be the 10th, and the third would be the 17th. Wait, but wait, let me check again. If the first Thursday is the 3rd, then adding 7 days would be the 10th (second Thursday), then another 7 days is the 17th (third Thursday). So the third Thursday would be the 17th. But I need to make sure that November 2022 actually has that. Let me check the actual calendar. Wait, November has 30 days. So 17th is within the month. So the answer should be 17. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again. Let me think: If November 1 is a Tuesday, then November 2 is Wednesday, November 3 is Thursday. So first Thursday is 3rd. Then adding 7 days: 3 +7=10, so 10th is second Thursday. Then 10+7=17, third Thursday. So yes, 17th. But I should verify if November 1, 2022, was indeed a Tuesday. Maybe I can check an online calendar or use a different method. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year. Let me think. Let's count the days. For example, if I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me check with another approach. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. Because if November 3 is Thursday, then 4th is Friday. So that's correct. So the first Thursday is 3rd, second is 10th, third is 17th. Therefore, the answer should be 17. But wait, maybe I should check another date. For example, November 17, 2022. Let me think. If November 1 is Tuesday, then November 17 is 16 days later. 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days.

First, I should figure out the dates of each Thursday in that range.\n\nLet me start by checking the starting date. April 3, 2022, is a Sunday. So the next day, April 4, is a Monday. Then April 5 is Tuesday, April 6 is Wednesday, April 7 is Thursday. So the first Thursday in the range is April 7, 2022.\n\nNow, I need to find all the Thursdays from April 7 up to June 28. Let me break this down into months. April, May, and June.\n\nStarting with April. April 7 is the first Thursday. Then adding 7 days each time. So April 14, 21, 28. Wait, April 28 is a Thursday? Let me check. April 7 is Thursday. Adding 7 days: 7+7=14 (Thursday), 14+7=21 (Thursday), 21+7=28 (Thursday). So April has four Thursdays: 7, 14, 21, 28.\n\nNow May. May 1, 2022, is a Sunday.

Wait, if April 28 is Thursday, then April 29 is Friday, April 30 is Saturday, May 1 is Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, April 28 is Thursday. Then April 29 is Friday, April 30 is Saturday, May 1 is Sunday. Wait, that would mean May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday. So the first Thursday in May is May 5. Then adding 7 days: May 12, 19, 26. So that's four Thursdays in May: 5, 12, 19, 26.\n\nNow June. June 1, 2022, is a Wednesday. Let me check that. May 31 is a Tuesday (since May 5 is Thursday, then May 12 is Thursday, 19, 26, then May 31 is Tuesday? Wait, May 26 is Thursday. May 27 is Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. Yes, May 31 is Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 2 is Thursday. So the first Thursday in June is June 2. Then adding 7 days: June 9, 16, 23, 30. But the end date is June 28. So June 30 is beyond the end date. So in June, the Thursdays are June 2, 9, 16, 23. June 30 is after June 28, so that's excluded. So that's four Thursdays in June.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check June 28. June 2 is Thursday. Then adding 7 days: 9, 16, 23, 30. So June 23 is Thursday. Then June 23 +7 is June 30. So June 28 is two days before June 30. So June 28 is a Tuesday. So the last Thursday in the range is June 23. So that's four Thursdays in June.\n\nSo total Thursdays: April has 4, May has 4, June has 4. That's 12 in total. Wait, but wait. Let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of weeks between the dates. Let me check the total number of days between April 3 and June 28, inclusive. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can check each month again.\n\nApril: April 7, 14, 21, 28. That's four Thursdays. Correct.\n\nMay: May 5, 12, 19, 26. Four Thursdays. Correct.\n\nJune: June 2, 9, 16, 23. Four Thursdays. So total 12. But wait, the end date is June 28, which is a Tuesday. So June 23 is the last Thursday before June 28. So that's correct. So 4+4+4=12. But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar. Let me think. April 3 is Sunday. So April 7 is Thursday. Then April 14, 21, 28. Then May 5, 12, 19, 26. Then June 2, 9, 16, 23. That's 4+4+4=12. So the answer should be 12. But wait, maybe I need to check if the end date is included. The end date is June 28, which is a Tuesday. So the last Thursday is June 23. So yes, that's included. So 12 Thursdays in total. Hmm. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the total number of days between April 3 and June 28, inclusive. Let's see. April has 30 days. So from April 3 to April 30 is 28 days. Then May has 31 days, and June 1 to June 28 is 28 days. So total days: 28 (April) + 31 (May) + 28 (June) = 87 days. Wait, but that's from April 3 to June 28 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, April 3 to April 30 is 28 days (since April 3 is day 1, April 4 is day 2, etc., up to April 30 is day 28). Then May has 31 days, so adding 31. Then June 1 to June 28 is 28 days. So total is 28 + 31 + 28 = 87 days. Now, the number of Thursdays in 87 days. But since the first day is Sunday (April 3), then the first Thursday is day 5 (April 7). Then each week has one Thursday. So the number of Thursdays would be the number of weeks plus any extra days. Let's see. 87 days divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 3 days. So 12 weeks would have 12 Thursdays. Then the remaining 3 days (days 85, 86, 87) would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So no additional Thursdays.

Let me check. April 12, 2022, was a Tuesday. So if I start on Tuesday, April 12, then the next day, April 13, is Wednesday, and so on. Let me confirm that. Let me think about the days of the week.\n\nSo, starting from April 12 (Tuesday), the next Monday would be April 18, right? Because April 12 is Tuesday, so adding 6 days gets to Monday. Wait, no. Wait, Tuesday plus 1 day is Wednesday, plus 2 is Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday. So yes, April 18 is a Monday.

So I need to check how many Mondays are between April 12 and June 1 inclusive.\n\nLet me list out the dates. Let's start with April 12 (Tuesday). Let's count the Mondays in April first. April 12 is Tuesday. So the first Monday after that would be April 18. Then April 25. Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Then in May, May 2 is a Monday. Then May 9, 16, 23, 30. Then June 6, 13, 20, 27. But June 1 is the end date, so June 6 is after June 1. So June 1 is Wednesday, so the last Monday before June 1 would be May 30. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let's verify the dates. Let me check the actual days. Wait, maybe I should check the actual calendar for 2022. But since I can't look it up, I need to calculate based on the given start date.\n\nApril 12, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let's count the days from April 12 to June 1. Let's calculate the total number of days. April has 30 days. So from April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 = 18 days, plus 1 (including April 12) so 19 days in April. Then May has 31 days, and June 1 is 1 day. So total days from April 12 to June 1 inclusive is 19 (April) + 31 (May) + 1 (June 1) = 51 days? Wait, no. Wait, April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end dates, it's 18 + 1 = 19 days in April. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 19 + 31 = 50 days. Then June 1 is one more day, so total is 51 days. Wait, but if the period is from April 12 to June 1 inclusive, that's 51 days. Let me check again. April 12 to April 13 is 2 days. So April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days, so 19 + 31 = 50 days. Then June 1 is one more day, so total 51 days. So 51 days in total.\n\nNow, to find how many Mondays are in 51 days. Since April 12 is a Tuesday, the first day is Tuesday. So the days of the week will cycle every 7 days. Let's find how many weeks and extra days there are in 51 days. 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks (49 days) and 2 days remaining. So there are 7 full weeks, which would have 7 Mondays, plus 2 extra days. Now, the first day is Tuesday, so the next two days are Wednesday and Thursday. So in the extra two days, there are no Mondays. Therefore, total Mondays would be 7. But wait, that can't be right because I know that in April, there are two Mondays (April 18 and 25), then in May there are 5 Mondays (2, 9, 16, 23, 30), and then in June, the first Monday is June 6, but June 1 is Wednesday, so June 6 is the first Monday of June. But since the period ends on June 1, which is Wednesday, then June 6 is not included. So total Mondays would be 2 (April) + 5 (May) = 7. So that matches the calculation. Therefore, the answer is 7.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me list the Mondays:\n\nApril 18 (Monday), April 25 (Monday), May 2 (Monday), May 9, May 16, May 23, May 30. That's 7 Mondays. Yes.

So"], [74, "Between Saturday, March 19, 2022 and Sunday, May 8, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? State the amount as a number.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between March 19, 2022, and May 8, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. March 19, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, let me confirm that. Wait, March 19, 2022: Let me think. March 14, 2022 was a Monday. So March 14 (Monday), 15 (Tuesday), 16 (Wednesday), 17 (Thursday), 18 (Friday), 19 (Saturday). Yes, March 19 is a Saturday. So the first day is a Saturday. The last day is May 8, 2022. Let me check what day that is. Let's see, March has 31 days. So March 19 is Saturday, March 20 is Sunday, March 21 is Monday. Then April has 30 days. Let me count the days from March 19 to May 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. But maybe breaking it down into weeks would be better.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days between March 19 and May 8, inclusive. Let's calculate the days step by step.\n\nMarch 19 to March 31: March has 31 days. From March 19 to March 31 inclusive is 31 - 19 + 1 = 13 days. Wait, March 19 is day 1, March 20 is day 2, ..., March 31 is day 13. So that's 13 days.\n\nThen April has 30 days. So April 1 to April 30 is 30 days.\n\nThen May 1 to May 8 is 8 days.\n\nSo total days from March 19 to May 8 inclusive is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. Wait, but let me check again. Wait, March 19 to March 31 is 13 days. Then April is 30 days. Then May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. So total days is 51.\n\nNow, out of these 51 days, how many are weekends? Let's see. Since March 19 is a Saturday, the first day is Saturday. Then March 20 is Sunday. Then March 21 is Monday, and so on.\n\nSo the weekends in this period would be the Saturdays and Sundays. Let's count how many Saturdays and Sundays there are between March 19 and May 8 inclusive.\n\nStarting from March 19 (Saturday), the next Saturday is March 26, then April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Then May 7 is a Saturday. Then May 8 is a Sunday. Wait, let me check each week.\n\nFirst, March 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat). So March 26 is Saturday. Then April 2 is Saturday, April 9, 16, 23, 30. Then May 7 is Saturday. Then May 8 is Sunday. So let's list all the Saturdays and Sundays in this period.\n\nSaturdays: March 19, 26; April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30; May 7. That's 7 Saturdays.\n\nSundays: March 20, 27; April 3, 10, 17, 24, 31; May 1, 8. Wait, let's check. March 20 is Sunday. Then March 27 is Sunday. April 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. Then May 1 and 8. So that's 7 Sundays.\n\nWait, but March 27 is Sunday. Then April 3 is next Sunday. So that's 7 Sundays. Let me count:\n\nMarch 20 (1), 27 (2); April 3 (3), 10 (4), 17 (5), 24 (6), 31 (7); May 1 (8), 8 (9). Wait, that's 9 Sundays? Wait, but May 8 is included in the period. Wait, the total days are 51. Let me check again.\n\nWait, March 19 is Saturday. So March 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat). Then March 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), 31 (Thu). Then April 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), etc.\n\nSo in March, the Sundays are March 20 and 27. Then April has Sundays on 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. Then May has Sundays on 1 and 8. So that's 2 + 5 + 2 = 9 Sundays. Wait, but that's 9 Sundays. But earlier I thought 7. So that's a mistake. So the total number of Sundays is 9. Similarly, Saturdays are March 19, 26; April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30; May 7. That's 7 Saturdays. So total weekends are 7 + 9 = 16 days. Therefore, the total business days would be 51 total days minus 16 weekend days = 35 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because if there are 51 days total, and 16 weekends, then 51 - 16 = 35. But maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, March 19 is Saturday. So March 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun). Then March 21-25 are Mon-Fri. March 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). March 28-31 are Mon-Thu. Then April 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 4-6 (Mon-Wed), 7 (Thu), 8 (Fri), 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun), etc. So April has 30 days. Let's count the Sundays in April: April 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. That's 5 Sundays. Then May 1 and 8 are Sundays. So that's 2 more. So total Sundays: March 20, 27 (2), April 3, 10, 17, 24, 31 (5), May 1, 8 (2). Total 2+5+2=9 Sundays. Correct.\n\nSaturdays: March 19, 26 (2), April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (5), May 7 (1). Total 2+5+1=8? Wait, March 19 and 26 are two, then April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (five), and May 7 (one). That's 2+5+1=8 Saturdays. Wait, earlier I thought 7. So that's a mistake. So total weekends are 8 Saturdays and 9 Sundays, total 17 days. Then total business days would be 51 - 17 = 34. But this contradicts the previous count. So where is the error?\n\nWait, let me list all the Saturdays and Sundays between March 19 and May 8 inclusive.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nMarch 19 (Sat)\n\nMarch 26 (Sat)\n\nApril 2 (Sat)\n\nApril 9 (Sat)\n\nApril 16 (Sat)\n\nApril 23 (Sat)\n\nApril 30 (Sat)\n\nMay 7 (Sat)\n\nThat's 8 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\nMarch 20 (Sun)\n\nMarch 27 (Sun)\n\nApril 3 (Sun)\n\nApril 10 (Sun)\n\nApril 17 (Sun)\n\nApril 24 (Sun)\n\nApril 31 (Sun)\n\nMay 1 (Sun)\n\nMay 8 (Sun)\n\nThat's 9 Sundays.\n\nSo total weekends: 8 + 9 = 17 days. Therefore, business days are 51 - 17 = 34.\n\nBut earlier I thought 35. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the total days again. March 19 to March 31 is 13 days. April is 30 days. May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. 13 + 30 + 8 = 51. Correct.\n\nSo 51 days total. 17 weekends. 51 - 17 = 34 business days.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's count the business days week by week.\n\nStarting from March 19 (Saturday). So the first week:\n\nMarch 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri). So from March 19 to March 25: 7 days. Business days are Mon-Fri: 21-25 (5 days). But March 19 is Saturday, 20 Sunday. So in this first week, business days are 21-25 (5 days).\n\nThen March 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), 31 (Thu). So March 26-31: 7 days. Business days are 28-31 (4 days) and March 26 is Saturday, 27 Sunday. Wait, March 28 is Monday, so business days are 28, 29, 30, 31 (4 days).\n\nThen April 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu), 8 (Fri), 9 (Sat), etc. So April 1-7: 7 days. Business days are 1-7 (Fri, Mon-Thu, Fri). Wait, April 1 is Friday, so business days are 1 (Fri), 4 (Mon), 5 (Tue), 6 (Wed), 7 (Thu). That's 5 days. Wait, but April 1 is Friday, so that's a business day. Then April 2 is Saturday, 3 Sunday. So from April 1 to April 7: 5 business days (1,4,5,6,7).\n\nThen April 8-14: 7 days. April 8 is Saturday, 9 Sunday. So business days are 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue), 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri). That's 5 days.\n\nApril 15-21: 7 days. April 15 is Saturday, 16 Sunday. Business days are 17 (Mon), 18 (Tue), 19 (Wed), 20 (Thu), 21 (Fri). 5 days.\n\nApril 22-28: 7 days. April 22 is Saturday, 23 Sunday. Business days 24 (Mon), 25 (Tue), 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri). 5 days.\n\nApril 29- May 5: 7 days. April 29 is Saturday, 30 Sunday. Business days 30 is Sunday, so May 1 (Mon), 2 (Tue), 3 (Wed), 4 (Thu), 5 (Fri). Wait, April 29 is Saturday, 30 Sunday. So May 1 is Monday. So business days are May 1-5 (5 days).\n\nThen May 6-12: 7 days. May 6 is Saturday, 7 Sunday. Business days 8 (Mon), 9 (Tue), 10 (Wed), 11 (Thu), 12 (Fri). 5 days.\n\nBut wait, our period ends on May 8. So May 8 is included. So let's check up to May 8.\n\nSo from May 1 to May 8: May 1 (Mon), 2 (Tue), 3 (Wed), 4 (Thu), 5 (Fri), 6 (Sat), 7 (Sun), 8 (Mon). So business days are May 1-5 (5 days) and May 8 (1 day). So that's 6 days.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that from April 29- May 5 is 5 days. Then May 6-8 is 3 days (May 6 is Sat, 7 Sun, 8 Mon). So business days in May 6-8: only May 8 (1 day). So total business days in May would be 5 (from May 1-5) + 1 (May 8) = 6.\n\nSo adding up all the business days:\n\nMarch 19-25: 5 days\n\nMarch 26-31: 4 days\n\nApril 1-7: 5 days\n\nApril 8-14: 5 days\n\nApril 15-21: 5 days\n\nApril 22-28: 5 days\n\nApril 29- May 5: 5 days\n\nMay 6-8: 1 day\n\nWait, but that's 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 35 days. Wait, but earlier calculation said 34. So there's a discrepancy here. Which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me recount:\n\nMarch 19-25: 5 days (Mon-Fri: 21-25)\n\nMarch 26-31: 4 days (Mon-Fri: 28-31)\n\nApril 1-7: 5 days (1,4-7)\n\nApril 8-14: 5 days (10-14)\n\nApril 15-21: 5 days (17-21)\n\nApril 22-28: 5 days (24-28)\n\nApril 29- May 5: 5 days (30 is Sunday, so May 1-5: 5 days)\n\nMay 6-8: 1 day (May 8)\n\nSo total is 5+4=9, +5=14, +5=19, +5=24, +5=29, +5=34, +1=35. So 35 business days. But earlier calculation said 51 total days minus 17 weekends (34) equals 34. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the weekend count. Let me check again. If the total days are 51, and business days are 35, then weekends would be 51-35=16. But earlier I counted 17. So where is the mistake?\n\nLet me list all the weekends again. Saturdays and Sundays between March 19 and May 8 inclusive.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nMarch 19, 26\n\nApril 2, 9, 16, 23, 30\n\nMay 7\n\nThat's 2 + 5 + 1 = 8 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\nMarch 20, 27\n\nApril 3, 10, 17, 24, 31\n\nMay 1, 8\n\nThat's 2 + 5 + 2 = 9 Sundays.\n\nTotal weekends: 8 + 9 = 17. So 51 - 17 = 34. But according to the week-by-week count, it's 35. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total days are not 51. Let me check again.\n\nMarch 19 to March 31: 31 - 19 + 1 = 13 days.\n\nApril has 30 days.\n\nMay 1 to May 8: 8 days.\n\nTotal: 13 + 30 + 8 = 51. Correct.\n\nSo if the total days are 51, and the business days are 35, then weekends are 16. But according to the weekend count, it's 17.

Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2043 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2043 divided by 4. 4 times 510 is 2040, so 2043 minus 2040 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 2043 is not divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check the other conditions just in case.\n\nNext, even though 2043 isn't divisible by 4, maybe it's a century year? Century years are those divisible by 100, like 2000, 2100, etc. 2043 divided by 100 is 20.43, so it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition about being divisible by 400 doesn't apply here. \n\nSo since 2043 isn't divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. I think that's all.

Both dates are included, so I need to check if they are Mondays and count them.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week August 5, 2022, was. Let me recall that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I should check that again. Wait, I think August 5, 2022, was actually a Friday. Let me confirm. Wait, maybe I can use a calendar or some method to verify. Alternatively, I can use the fact that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Let me think. If that's correct, then the next day, August 6, 2022, would be a Saturday, August 7 a Sunday, August 8 a Monday. So the first Monday in this period would be August 8, 2022. Then the next Mondays would be every 7 days. Let me list them out.\n\nStarting from August 5 (Friday), the Mondays would be:\n\nAugust 8 (Monday), then August 15, 22, and then August 29. Wait, August 29 is the end date. Let me check if August 29 is a Monday. If August 8 is a Monday, then adding 7 days: 8 +7=15 (Monday), 15+7=22 (Monday), 22+7=29 (Monday). So that's four Mondays: 8, 15, 22, 29. But wait, the start date is August 5, which is a Friday, and the end date is August 29, which is a Monday. So including both dates, the Mondays are 8, 15, 22, 29. That's four Mondays. But wait, let me check again. Let me count the days between August 5 and August 29 inclusive. How many days is that? From August 5 to August 29 is 25 days (since 29-5=24, plus 1 day for inclusion, so 25 days total). Now, if the first day is Friday, then the Mondays would be every 7 days. Let me count how many Mondays are in 25 days. Starting from day 1 (August 5) as Friday, then day 8 (August 8) is Monday. Then day 15, 22, 29. So that's four Mondays. But wait, August 29 is the 25th day. So yes, four Mondays. Therefore, the answer should be 4. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial day. Let me check again. Let me check what day August 5, 2022, was. I can use an online calendar or a date calculator. Wait, I think I remember that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Let me confirm. For example, August 6, 2022, was a Saturday. Then August 7 was Sunday, August 8 was Monday. So yes, August 8 is a Monday. Then adding 7 days: 15, 22, 29. So that's four Mondays.

Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 1950. First, divide 1950 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 487 is 1948, so 1950 minus 1948 is 2. That means 1950 divided by 4 is 487.5, which isn't a whole number. So 1950 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that division. Let me add 4 to 1948: 1948 + 4 is 1952, so 1950 is two years after 1948, which is a leap year. So 1950 is not a leap year. Also, since 1950 isn't a century year (it's not divisible by 100), the second condition about 400 doesn't come into play here. So even if it were divisible by 4, since it's not a century year, it would still be a leap year. But since it's not divisible by 4 at all, it's definitely not a leap year.

Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards to find other dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 16, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about the days in May. May has 31 days. Let's see, if I can find a known date in May 2022, like May 1st, and then count the days from there. \n\nWait, I think May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, and so on. Then May 16 would be 15 days later. Since 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So adding 15 days to Sunday would be Sunday + 1 day = Monday. Wait, but that would make May 16 a Monday. But I need to confirm if May 1, 2022 was indeed a Sunday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1 is Friday, then April 8 is also Friday, and so on. Then May 1 would be 30 days after April 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 1 (Friday) plus 2 days is Sunday. So May 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Therefore, May 16 is 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 1 day is Monday. Therefore, May 16, 2022 would be a Monday. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that April 1, 2022 was indeed a Friday. Let me think. I know that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. March has 31 days, so March 1 is Tuesday, March 8 is Tuesday, March 15 is Tuesday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 29 is Tuesday. Then April 5 is Tuesday. April 5 is Tuesday, so April 1 is 4 days before that. April 1 would be Tuesday minus 4 days. Tuesday minus 1 day is Monday, minus 2 is Sunday, minus 3 is Saturday, minus 4 is Friday. So April 1, 2022 was a Friday. That checks out. Therefore, May 1 is Sunday. Then May 16 is 15 days later, which is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 1 day is Monday. Therefore, May 16, 2022 was a Monday. \n\nAlternatively, I can check using another method. For example, using the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, if that's the case, then let's count the days from January 1 to May 16. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Saturday. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, and May 16 is the 16th day of May. \n\nSo total days from January 1 to May 16: 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 16 (May) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 16 is 136 days. Now, 136 days from January 1, 2022. Since January 1 is a Saturday, we can calculate 136 days later. 136 divided by 7 is 19 weeks and 3 days. So 19 weeks later is also a Saturday, plus 3 days would be Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. Hmm, that's a problem. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. If January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 136 days would be 19 weeks (133 days) plus 3 days. So 133 days later is also a Saturday, then adding 3 days would be Tuesday. But earlier, I thought May 16 was a Monday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. Let me recall that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. That seems correct. So if that's the case, then May 16 is 136 days later, which would be Tuesday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where May 1 was Sunday. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days from January 1 to May 16. Let me recalculate. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90 days. April has 30 days, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120 days. Then May 16 is 16 days into May. So total days from January 1 to May 16 is 120 + 16 = 136 days. That's correct. So 136 days from January 1, 2022 (Saturday) is 136 days later. 136 divided by 7 is 19*7=133, remainder 3. So 19 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. But earlier, I thought May 1 was Sunday. So that would mean that May 1 is 31 days after January 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So January 1 is Saturday, adding 3 days would be Tuesday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion that May 1 was Sunday. So there's a problem here. \n\nWait, this suggests that my earlier assumption that April 1 was a Friday is wrong. Let me check again. If January 1 is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February 5 is Saturday. Then February 12 is Saturday, February 19 is Saturday, February 26 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday. March 12 is Saturday, March 19 is Saturday, March 26 is Saturday. April 2 is Saturday. April 9 is Saturday, April 16 is Saturday, April 23 is Saturday, April 30 is Saturday. So April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. That matches the previous conclusion. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 16 is 15 days later. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 1 day is Monday. But according to the other calculation, May 16 is 136 days from January 1, which is Tuesday. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the days from January 1 to May 16. Let me check again. January 1 to May 16: January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90 days. April has 30 days, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120 days. Then May 16 is 16 days into May. So total days from January 1 to May 16 is 120 + 16 = 136 days. That's correct. So 136 days from January 1 (Saturday) is 136 days later. 136 divided by 7 is 19 weeks and 3 days. So Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday. But according to the other method, May 16 is Monday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. That seems correct. So that part is correct. Then why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the calculation of the days from January 1 to May 16. Let me count the days step by step. Let's take January 1 as day 0. Then January 1 is day 0 (Saturday). January 2 is day 1 (Sunday), ..., January 8 is day 7 (Saturday). January 9 is day 8 (Sunday). So January 31 is day 30 (since 31-1=30). Then February 1 is day 31. February has 28 days, so February 28 is day 31 + 27 = day 58. March 1 is day 59. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 59 + 30 = day 89. April 1 is day 90. April has 30 days, so April 30 is day 90 + 29 = day 119. May 1 is day 120. May 16 is day 120 + 15 = day 135. Wait, so May 16 is day 135. So 135 days from January 1. Wait, earlier I thought it was 136 days. But if January 1 is day 0, then May 16 is day 135. So 135 days later. 135 divided by 7 is 19 weeks and 2 days. So 19 weeks is 133 days, so 135 - 133 = 2 days. So Saturday (day 0) + 2 days is Monday. That matches the previous conclusion. So where was the mistake before? Oh, I think I added 136 days, but actually, if January 1 is day 0, then May 16 is day 135. So 135 days later. So 135 divided by 7 is 19*7=133, remainder 2. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Therefore, May 16, 2022 is a Monday. \n\nSo the earlier mistake was in the calculation of the number of days. I had said 136 days, but actually it's 135 days. Because if January 1 is day 0, then May 16 is day 135. Therefore, the correct day is Monday. So that aligns with the other method where May 1 is Sunday, and adding 15 days (which is 2 weeks and 1 day) gives Monday. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Monday.", "Monday"], [74, "On which weekday did April 5, 2022 fall?

But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or calculations. Let me try to calculate it step by step.\n\nLet me start with a known date. For example, I remember that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. If that's correct, then adding four days would get me to April 5. So Friday (1st) + 1 day is Saturday (2nd), +2 is Sunday (3rd), +3 is Monday (4th), +4 is Tuesday (5th). So that would make April 5, 2022 a Tuesday. But I need to confirm if April 1, 2022 was indeed a Friday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, March has 31 days, so April 1 is 31 days after March 1. Since 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So if March 1 was a Tuesday, then March 8 is Tuesday, March 15 is Tuesday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 29 is Tuesday. Then April 5 would be 6 days after March 29.

If March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then March 8 is Tuesday, March 15 is Tuesday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 29 is Tuesday. Then April 5 is 6 days after March 29. March 29 is Tuesday, so adding 6 days: Tuesday + 1 is Wednesday, +2 Thursday, +3 Friday, +4 Saturday, +5 Sunday, +6 Monday. So April 5 would be a Monday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought April 1 was Friday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday is wrong. Let me try to find another way. Let's think about January 1, 2022. I think that was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year), so February 28 is a Monday (since 28 days is 4 weeks). Then March 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. So that matches the previous calculation. So March 1 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 1 (Tuesday) + 3 days is Friday. Therefore, April 1, 2022 is a Friday. Then April 5 would be 4 days later, which would be Tuesday. So that would make April 5 a Tuesday. But earlier when I calculated from March 29 (Tuesday) to April 5, I got Monday. That's conflicting. Where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, if March 1 is Tuesday, then March 29 is Tuesday (since 28 days later is March 29, which is 4 weeks later, so same day). Then March 29 is Tuesday. Then April 5 is 6 days later. So Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. But according to the other calculation, April 1 is Friday, so April 5 is Tuesday. There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between March 1 and April 1. March has 31 days, so March 1 to April 1 is 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days.

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's start from a known date. Let's say I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then, adding days to get to May 13. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday, May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday, May 9 is Monday, May 10 is Tuesday, May 11 is Wednesday, May 12 is Thursday, and May 13 would be Friday. Wait, that would make May 13 a Friday. But I'm not sure if May 1 was a Sunday. Maybe I should check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the year 2022. I know that 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. Let's start from a known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, how did I get that? Let me think. If March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then April 1 would be 31 days later. Since 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 1 (Tuesday) plus 3 days would be Friday. So April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Then, April has 30 days, so May 1 would be 30 days after April 1. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So April 1 (Friday) plus 2 days is Sunday. Therefore, May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then, adding days to get to May 13. May 1 is Sunday, so May 13 is 12 days later. 12 divided by 7 is 1 week and 5 days. So Sunday plus 5 days is Friday. Therefore, May 13, 2022 was a Friday. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that my initial assumption about April 1 being a Friday is correct. Let me check again. If March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then April 1 would be 31 days later. 31 mod 7 is 3, so Tuesday + 3 days is Friday. That seems right. Then May 1 is 30 days after April 1. 30 mod 7 is 2, so Friday + 2 days is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 13 is 12 days later. 12 mod 7 is 5, so Sunday + 5 days is Friday. So that would make May 13 a Friday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that May 13, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, but I need to confirm this. Alternatively, I can use an online calendar, but since I can't do that, I have to rely on my calculations. \n\nAnother way: Let's check the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, May 13, 2022. If I remember that May 13, 2022 was a Friday, then that's the answer. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, I can use the fact that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me count the days from May 1 to May 13. May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday, May 6 is Friday, May 7 is Saturday, May 8 is Sunday, May 9 is Monday, May 10 is Tuesday, May 11 is Wednesday, May 12 is Thursday, May 13 is Friday.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week January 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Oh right, because 2022 started on a Saturday. So January 1 is Saturday.\n\nSo if January 1 is Saturday, then the first Tuesday would be the 3rd. Because Saturday is day 1, Sunday is 2, Monday 3, Tuesday 4? Wait, no.

Wait, the total number of days between August 28 and September 8 inclusive is (September 8 - August 28) + 1. Let me calculate that. August has 31 days, so from August 28 to August 31 is 4 days (28,29,30,31). Then September 1 to September 8 is 8 days. So total is 4 + 8 = 12 days.

So the first Wednesday is April 27, 2022.\n\nThen, each subsequent Wednesday would be 7 days later.

And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so I need to figure out the day of the week for March 26, given that January 1st is a Tuesday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are there from January 1st to March 26th. Let me break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since the first day is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the first day of the year being a Tuesday. So if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year? Wait, but maybe the problem is in a specific year. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to assume that it's not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed in such a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no. Wait, if it's a leap year, then February has 29 days, which would affect the total number of days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check if the year is a leap year or not. Wait, but the problem says \"the first day of the year was a Tuesday\". So if the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to assume that it's not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless? Wait, but that's not possible. For example, if the year is a leap year, then the total days from January 1 to March 26 would be different. So maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Let me check the standard Gregorian calendar. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to assume that it's a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a year where March 26 is the same day regardless of leap year? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's assume that the year is not a leap year. So February has 28 days. Then, the total days from January 1 to March 26 would be 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 26 (March) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then the number of days from January 1 to March 26 is (31 - 1) + 28 + 26? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days between January 1 and March 26 is calculated as follows: January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 26 is 26 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 30 (January) + 28 (February) + 26 (March) = 84 days? Wait, but that would be 30 + 28 is 58, plus 26 is 84. But wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 2 is day 2, so the number of days between January 1 and March 26 is 84 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you count from January 1 to March 26 inclusive, that's 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But if you want the number of days between January 1 and March 26, not including January 1, then it's 84 days. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, you need to know how many days have passed since the starting day. So if January 1 is a Tuesday, then January 1 is day 0. Then, the next day, January 2 is day 1, which is Wednesday. So to find the day of the week for March 26, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1 and March 26, then take that number modulo 7. Because each 7 days cycle repeats the same day of the week.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of days from January 1 to March 26. Let's assume it's not a leap year. So January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 26 is 26 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 30 + 28 + 26 = 84 days. Wait, but that would be 84 days after January 1. Wait, but if January 1 is day 0, then day 1 is January 2, day 2 is January 3, etc. So March 26 is 84 days after January 1. So 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. So if January 1 is a Tuesday, then adding 84 days (which is 12 weeks) would still be a Tuesday. But that can't be right because March 26 is not 84 days after January 1. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 26 is 26 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 30 + 28 + 26 = 84 days. Wait, but that would mean that March 26 is 84 days after January 1. But 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 12 weeks. So that would mean that March 26 is also a Tuesday. But that seems incorrect. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the number of days. Let me check with a different approach. Let's take a specific example. Let's say January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 8 is also Tuesday, January 15, 22, 29. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26. Then March 5, 12, 19, 26. So March 26 would be a Tuesday. Wait, that's the same as the first day. So that would mean that March 26 is a Tuesday. But that seems to be the case. But wait, if that's true, then the answer is Tuesday. But I need to check if my calculation of the days is correct. Let me count the days again. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days. So adding 28 days. Then March 26 is 26 days. So 30 + 28 is 58, plus 26 is 84. So 84 days. 84 divided by 7 is 12. So 12 weeks. So yes, same day. But that seems to be correct. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check with another method. Let's count the days in each month. January has 31 days. So if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 2 is Wednesday, and so on. Let's count the days for March 26. Let's count the number of days from January 1 to March 26. Let's do it step by step. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 26 is 26 days. So total days from January 1 to March 26 is 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. Wait, but that's including both the start and end dates. Wait, but if I want to find the number of days between January 1 and March 26, not including January 1, then it's 84 days. But if I include January 1, then it's 85 days. But when calculating the day of the week, if January 1 is day 0, then March 26 is day 84. So 84 days later. So 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 12 weeks. So same day. So that would be Tuesday. But wait, when I count the dates, like January 1 is Tuesday, then January 8 is Tuesday, etc. So January 29 is Tuesday. Then February 5 is Tuesday, 12, 19, 26. Then March 5 is Tuesday, 12, 19, 26. So March 26 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So the answer is Tuesday. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the year is not a leap year. Let me check if the problem is in a leap year. If it's a leap year, then February has 29 days. So the total days from January 1 to March 26 would be 31 (January) + 29 (February) + 26 (March) = 86 days. But that would be 86 days. 86 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 2 days. So 86 days later would be Tuesday + 2 days = Thursday. But the problem didn't specify whether it's a leap year or not. However, the problem says \"the first day of the year was a Tuesday\". So if the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. So maybe the problem is assuming a non-leap year. But how can I know? Wait, maybe the problem is in a specific year. For example, if the year is 2023, which is not a leap year, then March 26 would be a Sunday. Wait, but that's not matching. Wait, maybe I need to check. Wait, but the problem is not tied to a specific year. So perhaps the problem is designed in a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. But that's not possible. Wait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if the problem is in a leap year, then the answer would be different. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume that it's a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is in a non-leap year. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But I need to check again. Let me think again. If January 1 is Tuesday, then January 1 is day 0. Then January 2 is day 1 (Wednesday), and so on. Let's count the days for March 26. Let's count the number of days from January 1 to March 26. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 26 is 26 days. So total days is 30 + 28 + 26 = 84 days. So 84 days later. 84 divided by 7 is 12. So 12 weeks. So same day. Therefore, March 26 is Tuesday. So the answer is Tuesday. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if I count the days from January 1 to March 26, including both dates, then it's 31 + 28 + 26 = 85 days. But if I want to find the number of days between January 1 and March 26, not including January 1, then it's 84 days. So if January 1 is day 0, then March 26 is day 84. So 84 days later. So 84 divided by 7 is 12, so same day. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But I need to make sure that the calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let's count the days step by step. January 1 is Tuesday. January 8 is Tuesday (7 days later). January 15 is Tuesday. January 22 is Tuesday. January 29 is Tuesday. Then February 5 is Tuesday. February 12 is Tuesday. February 19 is Tuesday. February 26 is Tuesday. Then March 5 is Tuesday. March 12 is Tuesday. March 19 is Tuesday. March 26 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So March 26 is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "How many Wednesdays are there from Friday, December 2, 2022 to Wednesday, December 7, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Provide the count as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many Wednesdays there are from Friday, December 2, 2022, to Wednesday, December 7, 2022, inclusive. So I need to count all the Wednesdays between those two dates, including both the start and end dates.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the days of the week for each date in that range. Let me start by confirming the starting date. The problem says it's Friday, December 2, 2022. Let me check what day of the week that was. Wait, I think December 2, 2022 was a Friday. Let me confirm that. Well, if I remember correctly, December 1, 2022 was a Thursday, so December 2 would be a Friday. That seems right.\n\nNow, the end date is Wednesday, December 7, 2022. So the dates in question are from the 2nd to the 7th, inclusive. Let me list out each day and see which ones are Wednesdays.\n\nStarting with December 2, 2022: Friday. Then December 3 is Saturday, December 4 is Sunday, December 5 is Monday, December 6 is Tuesday, and December 7 is Wednesday. So the dates are:\n\n- 2: Friday\n- 3: Saturday\n- 4: Sunday\n- 5: Monday\n- 6: Tuesday\n- 7: Wednesday\n\nSo in this range, the only Wednesday is December 7th. Wait, but the start date is Friday, so the first day is Friday. So the Wednesdays would be the 7th. But wait, is there another Wednesday in between? Let me check again. From the 2nd to the 7th, inclusive. Let's count each day:\n\nDay 2: Friday\nDay 3: Saturday\nDay 4: Sunday\nDay 5: Monday\nDay 6: Tuesday\nDay 7: Wednesday\n\nSo only one Wednesday, which is the 7th. Therefore, the answer should be 1. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Maybe I should verify the days of the week for those dates. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of days between the two dates and then see how many weeks and extra days there are. But since the range is only 6 days (from the 2nd to the 7th inclusive), that's 6 days total. Let me count the days again:\n\nFrom Dec 2 (Friday) to Dec 7 (Wednesday) is 6 days. Let's list them:\n\n1. Dec 2: Friday\n2. Dec 3: Saturday\n3. Dec 4: Sunday\n4. Dec 5: Monday\n5. Dec 6: Tuesday\n6. Dec 7: Wednesday\n\nYes, that's six days. So only one Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is 1. Wait, but maybe I should check if the start date is included. The problem says inclusive of both dates. So the first day is Friday, which is included, and the last day is Wednesday, which is also included. So the count is just one Wednesday. So the answer is 1.", "1"], [74, "If today is Thursday, February 3, 2022, what day of the week will it be in 84 days? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. Today is Thursday, February 3, 2022. I need to find out what day of the week it will be 84 days from today. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 84 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 84 divided by 7 is exactly 12. So that means 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. Wait, if that's the case, then adding 12 weeks to Thursday would still be Thursday, right? Because each week cycles every 7 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, the problem says today is February 3, 2022. Let me confirm if 2022 is a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also by 400. 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, so not a leap year. So February has 28 days. But since we're adding 84 days, maybe the exact date isn't necessary? Because the question is only about the day of the week, not the actual date. So even if the date changes, the day of the week would be the same as adding multiples of 7 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify. Let's think: if today is Thursday, adding 7 days would be next Thursday. Adding 14 days would be another Thursday, and so on. So 84 days is 12 times 7, so 12 weeks. Therefore, the day of the week should be the same as today, which is Thursday. So the answer should be Thursday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check with another method. Let's count the days step by step. For example, adding 7 days: 7 days later is Thursday again. Then 14 days is Thursday again. So 84 days is 12 times that. So yes, same day. Therefore, the answer is Thursday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use modulo operation. 84 divided by 7 gives remainder 0. So 84 days later is 0 weeks and 0 days. So the day of the week is the same. Therefore, Thursday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with actual dates. Let's try to count. Let's start from February 3, 2022. Let's add days step by step. But that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can check the actual date 84 days later. Wait, but since the problem is only about the day of the week, maybe it's sufficient to know that 84 is a multiple of 7.

I need to find out how many business days there are from Thursday, February 10, 2022, to Saturday, March 12, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the business days directly. Let me start by checking the dates.\n\nStarting on February 10, 2022, which is a Thursday. Let's list out the dates week by week.\n\nFebruary 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), March 1 (Wed), 2 (Thu), 3 (Fri), 4 (Sat), 5 (Sun), 6 (Mon), 7 (Tue), 8 (Wed), 9 (Thu), 10 (Fri), 11 (Sat), 12 (Sun).\n\nWait, but the end date is March 12, which is a Saturday. So the period includes from February 10 (Thu) to March 12 (Sat). Let me check if I have the dates right.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total days first. Let's see. From February 10 to March 12 inclusive. Let's count the days in February after the 10th. February has 28 days in 2022, right? Because 2022 is not a leap year. So February 10 to February 28 is 28 - 10 = 18 days, but since we include both start and end, it's 18 + 1 = 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, from February 10 to February 28 inclusive: February 10 is day 1, then February 11 is day 2, ..., up to February 28. So the number of days is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total days from Feb 10 to March 12 inclusive is 19 + 12 = 31 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, using a date calculator. But since I can't do that, I need to count manually. Let me check the dates again.\n\nFebruary 10 (Thu) to February 28: Let's count the days. From 10th to 28th inclusive. Let's subtract 10 from 28: 28 - 10 = 18 days, but adding 1 gives 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total is 19 + 12 = 31 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 31 days.\n\nNow, out of these 31 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nLet me list the dates again, starting from February 10 (Thu):\n\nWeek 1: Feb 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun) \u2192 2 weekends (Sat and Sun)\nWeek 2: Feb 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun) \u2192 2 weekends\nWeek 3: Feb 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun) \u2192 2 weekends\nWeek 4: Feb 28 (Mon), March 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun) \u2192 2 weekends\nWeek 5: March 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat) \u2192 1 weekend (Sat)\n\nWait, but let me check each week properly. Let's break down the dates:\n\nFrom Feb 10 to Feb 13: 4 days (Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun) \u2192 2 weekends (Sat, Sun)\nFeb 14-20: 7 days (Mon to Sun) \u2192 2 weekends (Sat, Sun)\nFeb 21-27: 7 days (Mon to Sun) \u2192 2 weekends (Sat, Sun)\nFeb 28 to March 6: 7 days (Mon to Sun) \u2192 2 weekends (Sat, Sun)\nMarch 7-12: 6 days (Mon to Sat) \u2192 1 weekend (Sat)\n\nSo total weekends: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 weekends.\n\nSo total business days would be total days (31) minus weekends (9) = 22 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weeks. Let me recount the days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of Saturdays and Sundays between the dates.\n\nStarting from Feb 10 (Thu), the first Saturday is Feb 12, then Sunday Feb 13. Then next Saturday is Feb 19, Sunday 20. Then Feb 26, March 2. Then March 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Wait, March 12 is Saturday.\n\nSo let's list all the Saturdays and Sundays in the period:\n\nSaturdays: Feb 12, 19, 26, March 4, 11. That's 5 Saturdays.\n\nSundays: Feb 13, 20, 27, March 5, 12. That's 5 Sundays.\n\nTotal weekends: 5 + 5 = 10. Wait, but earlier I counted 9. So which is correct?\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nIf the period is from Feb 10 (Thu) to March 12 (Sat), inclusive.\n\nSaturdays:\n\n- Feb 12 (Sat)\n- Feb 19 (Sat)\n- Feb 26 (Sat)\n- March 4 (Sat)\n- March 11 (Sat)\n\nThat's 5 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\n- Feb 13 (Sun)\n- Feb 20 (Sun)\n- Feb 27 (Sun)\n- March 5 (Sun)\n- March 12 (Sun)\n\nThat's 5 Sundays.\n\nTotal weekends: 5 + 5 = 10. So that's 10 days. Therefore, total business days would be 31 - 10 = 21 days.\n\nBut earlier when I broke down the weeks, I had 9 weekends. So there's a discrepancy here. Which is correct?\n\nLet me check the total days again. If there are 10 weekends, then total days would be business days + 10. So if the total days is 31, then business days would be 21. But earlier when I broke down the weeks, I thought there were 9 weekends. So where is the mistake?\n\nLet me recount the weeks:\n\nWeek 1: Feb 10 (Thu) to Feb 13 (Sun) \u2192 4 days. Weekends: 2 (Sat, Sun)\nWeek 2: Feb 14 (Mon) to Feb 20 (Sun) \u2192 7 days. Weekends: 2 (Sat, Sun)\nWeek 3: Feb 21 (Mon) to Feb 27 (Sun) \u2192 7 days. Weekends: 2 (Sat, Sun)\nWeek 4: Feb 28 (Mon) to March 6 (Sun) \u2192 7 days. Weekends: 2 (Sat, Sun)\nWeek 5: March 7 (Mon) to March 12 (Sat) \u2192 6 days. Weekends: 1 (Sat)\n\nTotal weekends: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9. But according to the list of Saturdays and Sundays, there are 10. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the weeks are overlapping. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWeek 1: Feb 10 (Thu) to Feb 13 (Sun) \u2192 4 days. That's correct. Weekends: Sat (12) and Sun (13).\n\nWeek 2: Feb 14 (Mon) to Feb 20 (Sun) \u2192 7 days. Weekends: Sat (19) and Sun (20).\n\nWeek 3: Feb 21 (Mon) to Feb 27 (Sun) \u2192 7 days. Weekends: Sat (26) and Sun (27).\n\nWeek 4: Feb 28 (Mon) to March 6 (Sun) \u2192 7 days. Weekends: Sat (March 4) and Sun (5).\n\nWeek 5: March 7 (Mon) to March 12 (Sat) \u2192 6 days. Weekends: Sat (12).\n\nSo that's 2+2+2+2+1=9 weekends. But according to the list of Saturdays and Sundays, there are 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. That's 10. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, let's list all the Saturdays and Sundays:\n\nSaturdays:\n\n- Feb 12 (Week 1)\n- Feb 19 (Week 2)\n- Feb 26 (Week 3)\n- March 4 (Week 4)\n- March 11 (Week 5)\n\nThat's 5 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\n- Feb 13 (Week 1)\n- Feb 20 (Week 2)\n- Feb 27 (Week 3)\n- March 5 (Week 4)\n- March 12 (Week 5)\n\nThat's 5 Sundays.\n\nTotal 10. But according to the week breakdown, there are 9 weekends. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because in the week breakdown, the last week (Week 5) only has 6 days (March 7 to 12), which includes Saturday (12) but not Sunday. But according to the list, March 12 is a Saturday, and March 5 is a Sunday. So the Sunday in Week 4 is March 5, and the Sunday in Week 5 is March 12? Wait, no. March 12 is Saturday. So the Sunday in Week 5 would be March 13, but that's outside the range. Wait, the period ends on March 12, which is Saturday. So the Sundays in the period are up to March 12? No, March 12 is Saturday. So the Sundays in the period are March 5 and March 12? Wait, March 12 is Saturday. So March 5 is Sunday, and March 12 is Saturday. So the Sundays are March 5 and March 12? No, March 12 is Saturday. So the Sundays are March 5 and March 12? Wait, March 12 is Saturday. So March 5 is Sunday, March 12 is Saturday. So the Sundays in the period are March 5 and March 12? No, March 12 is Saturday. So the Sundays are March 5 and March 12? No, March 12 is Saturday. So the Sundays are March 5 and March 12? Wait, that can't be. Let me check the actual dates.\n\nWait, March 5 is a Sunday. Then March 6 is Monday, March 7 is Tuesday, March 8 is Wednesday, March 9 is Thursday, March 10 is Friday, March 11 is Saturday, March 12 is Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, March 12 is Saturday. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial date calculation.\n\nWait, let's check the actual days. Let me check the dates step by step.\n\nStarting from February 10, 2022, which is a Thursday.\n\nFebruary 10: Thu\n\nFebruary 11: Fri\n\nFebruary 12: Sat\n\nFebruary 13: Sun\n\nFebruary 14: Mon\n\nFebruary 15: Tue\n\nFebruary 16: Wed\n\nFebruary 17: Thu\n\nFebruary 18: Fri\n\nFebruary 19: Sat\n\nFebruary 20: Sun\n\nFebruary 21: Mon\n\nFebruary 22: Tue\n\nFebruary 23: Wed\n\nFebruary 24: Thu\n\nFebruary 25: Fri\n\nFebruary 26: Sat\n\nFebruary 27: Sun\n\nFebruary 28: Mon\n\nMarch 1: Tue\n\nMarch 2: Wed\n\nMarch 3: Thu\n\nMarch 4: Fri\n\nMarch 5: Sat\n\nMarch 6: Sun\n\nMarch 7: Mon\n\nMarch 8: Tue\n\nMarch 9: Wed\n\nMarch 10: Thu\n\nMarch 11: Fri\n\nMarch 12: Sat\n\nWait, so March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday. Then March 12 is Saturday. So the Sundays in the period are February 13, 20, 27, March 6. That's 4 Sundays. And the Saturdays are February 12, 19, 26, March 5, 12. That's 5 Saturdays. So total weekends are 5 + 4 = 9. So that's 9 weekends. So earlier when I thought there were 5 Sundays, I was wrong. March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday. So the Sundays are Feb 13, 20, 27, March 6. That's 4 Sundays. So total weekends are 5 + 4 = 9. Therefore, total business days would be 31 - 9 = 22 days.\n\nBut earlier when I listed the Sundays, I thought March 12 was a Sunday, but that's incorrect. March 12 is a Saturday. So that was my mistake. So the correct count is 9 weekends. Therefore, 31 total days minus 9 weekends equals 22 business days.\n\nSo the answer should be 22.", "22"], [74, "Name the day of the week for 01/17/2022. Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week January 17, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I might remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think. For example, I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So adding one day to Friday would make January 1, 2022 a Saturday? Wait, but that might not be right. Wait, if 2021 started on Friday, then 2022 would start on Saturday? Because 365 days is 52 weeks (364 days) plus 1 day. So yes, the next year would start one day later. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. \n\nBut wait, I need to confirm this. Alternatively, maybe I can use another reference. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. Wait, July 4, 2022: if I can remember that, then I can count backwards. Let's see. July 4 is a Monday. Then July 1 is a Friday (since July 4 is Monday, subtract 3 days). Then June 30 is a Thursday. Let me check that. Wait, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, if I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 17 would be 16 days later. Let's count. January 1 is Saturday. Then adding 16 days: 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday plus 2 days is Monday. So January 17 would be a Monday? Wait, but I need to make sure that January 1, 2022 was indeed a Saturday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check an online calendar or use another method. Wait, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think again. Let's take a known date. For example, I remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days because it was a leap year. So 2020 started on Wednesday, 2021 would start on Wednesday + 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So 2021 started on Friday. Then 2022 would start on Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Therefore, January 17 is 16 days later. 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Therefore, January 17, 2022 is a Monday. \n\nBut wait, I'm not 100% sure. Let me check another way. Let's take a date I know for sure. For example, March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if March 14 is a Monday, then February 28, 2022 was a Monday as well. Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can count the days from January 1. Let's see. January has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, and January 22 is Saturday. So January 17 would be 16 days after January 1. So 16 days is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. Therefore, January 17, 2022 is a Monday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another reference. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1 is Friday, then March 27 is a Monday. Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can count from January 1. Let's see. January 1 is Saturday. Then January 17 is 16 days later. 16 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday.

First, I should figure out what day of the week each of these dates falls on.\n\nWait, the start date is Monday, December 26. Let me check that. Wait, December 26, 2022. Let me think. I remember that December 26, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. Well, if I know that December 26 is a Monday, then the next day, December 27 is Tuesday, 28 is Wednesday, 29 is Thursday, and 30 is Friday. So the dates from Dec 26 to Dec 30 include Monday (26), Tuesday (27), Wednesday (28), Thursday (29), and Friday (30). \n\nSo the Thursdays in this period would be December 29, 2022. That's the only Thursday. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me count again. Starting from Monday, Dec 26: 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday.

Let me think about the week of December 26. If I know that December 26 is a Monday, then the next week's Monday would be January 2, 2023. So that seems correct.

The problem is: In a year where Wednesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. And I need to answer with the complete weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st (Wednesday) and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. Since January 1st is a Wednesday, January 1st is day 0. Then, January 2nd is day 1, and so on. But maybe it's easier to count the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd, inclusive or exclusive? Wait, the question is about April 3rd, so I need to count how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd, then find the weekday.\n\nWait, but if January 1st is Wednesday, then each subsequent day increments the weekday. So, for example, January 2nd is Thursday, January 3rd is Friday, etc. But I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1st to April 3rd, then find the remainder when divided by 7 to determine the weekday.\n\nLet me calculate the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days.

Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd, inclusive, then it's 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb, assuming it's not a leap year) + 31 (March) + 3 (April) = 31 + 29 + 31 + 3 = 94 days? Wait, but wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, etc. Wait, maybe I should calculate the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd, not including January 1st? Or including?\n\nWait, the key is that if January 1st is a Wednesday, then the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd is (April 3rd - January 1st) days. So, let's calculate the number of days between those two dates.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Assuming it's not a leap year, since the problem doesn't specify, but since the question is about a specific year where January 1st is Wednesday, maybe it's not a leap year? Wait, but the problem doesn't say it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, but if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. However, since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that doesn't depend on leap years? Wait, but the answer might depend on that. Wait, but the problem says \"in a year where Wednesday is January 1st\"\u2014so maybe the year is not a leap year? Or maybe it's a leap year? Hmm. Wait, but if the problem is designed for a specific answer, maybe the number of days is fixed regardless of leap year? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, February has 29 days, otherwise 28. So the total days from January 1st to April 3rd would be different. But the problem doesn't specify whether it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, but maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless of leap year? Or maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Wait, but how can I know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is the same regardless of leap year. Wait, but that's not possible. For example, if it's a leap year, then February has 29 days, so the total days from January 1st to April 3rd would be 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 94 days. If it's not a leap year, then 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. So the total days would be 93 or 94. Therefore, the weekday would be different. But the problem says \"in a year where Wednesday is January 1st\"\u2014so maybe the year is not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless? Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps the problem assumes a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is in a leap year? Wait, but how can I know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is the same regardless of leap year. Wait, but that's not possible. For example, if the total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 93 days, then 93 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 2 days. So if January 1st is Wednesday, then adding 93 days would be 13 weeks (which is 91 days) plus 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. But if it's 94 days, then 94 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. So the answer would be different. Therefore, the problem must be assuming a non-leap year. But how can I know?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then February would have 29 days. But the problem doesn't specify. However, since the problem is asking for a specific answer, maybe the year is not a leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is in a non-leap year. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's calculate both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Non-leap year.\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March has 31 days, and April 3rd is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93 days. So 93 days.\n\nCase 2: Leap year.\n\nFebruary has 29 days. So 31 + 29 + 31 + 3 = 94 days.\n\nBut the problem says \"in a year where Wednesday is January 1st\"\u2014so maybe the year is not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, then the number of days would be different. But how can I know? Wait, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless. But that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is in a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed with the assumption that the year is not a leap year. Let me check the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd in a non-leap year. So 93 days. Then 93 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 2 days. So if January 1st is Wednesday, then adding 93 days would be 13 weeks (which is 91 days) plus 2 days. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. Therefore, April 3rd would be a Friday. But if it's a leap year, then 94 days, which is 13 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. Therefore, the answer depends on whether it's a leap year. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. This is a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if the problem is designed for a specific answer, maybe the answer is Friday. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a leap year. But how can I know? Wait, maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if the problem is in a leap year, then the answer would be Saturday. But how can I know? Wait, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is in a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a leap year. Wait, but how can I know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual calendar. Wait, but I can't. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in a way that the answer is Friday. Let me think again. Let me try to count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is Wednesday. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Wednesday. Then, January 8th is also Wednesday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Wednesday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. April 2nd is Wednesday. Then April 3rd is Thursday. Wait, that would be Thursday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if January 1st is Wednesday, then January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1 (Thursday), and so on. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nLet me count the number of days from January 1st to April 3rd. Let's do it month by month.\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days. March has 31 days. April 3rd is 3 days into April.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to April 3rd is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 93 days. So 93 days from January 1st. But since January 1st is day 0, then April 3rd is day 93. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 93 days. So 93 days later. Now, 93 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 2 days. So 13 weeks is 91 days, so 93 days is 13 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday, +2 days is Friday. So April 3rd would be Friday. But when I tried to count step by step, I thought that April 2nd is Wednesday, so April 3rd is Thursday. That contradicts. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, let's count the days step by step again. Let's list the dates:\n\nJanuary 1st: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 8th: Wednesday (7 days later).\n\nJanuary 15th: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 22nd: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 29th: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 5th: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 12th: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 19th: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 26th: Wednesday.\n\nMarch 5th: Wednesday.\n\nMarch 12th: Wednesday.\n\nMarch 19th: Wednesday.\n\nMarch 26th: Wednesday.\n\nApril 2nd: Wednesday.\n\nApril 3rd: Thursday.\n\nWait, that's 93 days from January 1st. But according to this, April 3rd is Thursday. But according to the previous calculation, 93 days later is Friday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, the problem is in the way I'm counting the days. If January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 93 days. So if I add 93 days to January 1st, what day of the week is that?\n\nBut if I count the days step by step, and find that April 2nd is Wednesday, then April 3rd is Thursday. So that would mean that 92 days later is Wednesday (April 2nd), and 93 days later is Thursday. So that would mean that 93 days later is Thursday. But according to the modulo calculation, 93 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 2. So 93 days later is 2 days after Wednesday, which is Friday. But that contradicts the step-by-step count. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! Wait, the mistake is in the step-by-step count. Let me check again. Let's count the number of days from January 1st to April 2nd. Let's see:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March has 31 days, and April 2nd is 2 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 2nd is 31 + 28 + 31 + 2 = 92 days. So April 2nd is 92 days after January 1st. Then April 3rd is 93 days after January 1st. So if April 2nd is 92 days later, then 92 days later is Wednesday. Then 93 days later is Thursday. So that would mean that the step-by-step count is correct. But according to the modulo calculation, 92 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 1. So 92 days later is 1 day after Wednesday, which is Thursday. Wait, that's correct. So April 2nd is Thursday? But according to the step-by-step count, April 2nd is Wednesday. Wait, that's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, let's check the step-by-step count again. Let's list the dates:\n\nJanuary 1st: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 8th: Wednesday (7 days later).\n\nJanuary 15th: Wednesday (14 days later).\n\nJanuary 22nd: Wednesday (21 days later).\n\nJanuary 29th: Wednesday (28 days later).\n\nFebruary 5th: Wednesday (35 days later).\n\nFebruary 12th: Wednesday (42 days later).\n\nFebruary 19th: Wednesday (49 days later).\n\nFebruary 26th: Wednesday (56 days later).\n\nMarch 5th: Wednesday (63 days later).\n\nMarch 12th: Wednesday (70 days later).\n\nMarch 19th: Wednesday (77 days later).\n\nMarch 26th: Wednesday (84 days later).\n\nApril 2nd: Wednesday (91 days later).\n\nApril 3rd: Thursday (92 days later).\n\nWait, so according to this, April 2nd is 91 days later, which is Wednesday. Then April 3rd is 92 days later, which is Thursday. But according to the modulo calculation, 92 days later is 92 mod 7 = 92 / 7 = 13*7=91, remainder 1. So 92 days later is 1 day after Wednesday, which is Thursday. So that's correct. So April 3rd is Thursday. But earlier, when I thought that 93 days later would be Friday, that was a mistake. Because 93 days later is 93 mod 7 = 93 - 13*7 = 93 - 91 = 2. So 2 days after Wednesday is Friday. But that would be April 3rd? Wait, no. Wait, if April 2nd is 91 days later (Wednesday), then April 3rd is 92 days later (Thursday), and April 4th is 93 days later (Friday). So the mistake was in the previous calculation where I thought that 93 days later is Friday. But that's April 4th. So April 3rd is Thursday. Therefore, the correct answer is Thursday.\n\nBut why did the previous calculation of 93 days later being 2 days after Wednesday (Friday) give a different result? Because I was counting the days from January 1st to April 3rd as 93 days, but that's incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then April 3rd is day 92 (since April 2nd is day 91, April 3rd is day 92). Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIf January 1st is day 0 (Wednesday), then:\n\nJanuary 1st: 0 days later \u2192 Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 2nd: 1 day later \u2192 Thursday.\n\n...\n\nJanuary 8th: 7 days later \u2192 Wednesday.\n\nSo, the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 92 days. Because from January 1st to April 3rd is 92 days later. Therefore, 92 days later is 92 mod 7 = 92 / 7 = 13*7=91, remainder 1. So 1 day after Wednesday is Thursday. Therefore, April 3rd is Thursday.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated the total days as 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb)"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 10 to Tuesday, June 14, 2022 (including both start and end dates). State the amount as a number.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between April 10, 2022 (Sunday) and June 14, 2022 (Tuesday), inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. April 10, 2022 is a Sunday. Then, the next day is April 11, Monday. So the first day is a Sunday, which is a weekend. The end date is June 14, 2022, which is a Tuesday. So I need to include both start and end dates.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many days are between April 10 and June 14, inclusive. Let me break it down month by month.\n\nApril has 30 days. April 10 is the starting point. From April 10 to April 30 inclusive is 30 - 10 + 1 = 21 days. Wait, no. Wait, if I start on April 10, then the number of days from April 10 to April 30 inclusive is 30 - 10 + 1 = 21 days. But then May has 31 days, and June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total days would be 21 (April) + 31 (May) + 14 (June) = 66 days? Wait, but that's from April 10 to June 14 inclusive. Wait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, April 10 to April 30 is 21 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 21 + 31 = 52 days. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total is 52 + 14 = 66 days. So total days between April 10 and June 14 inclusive is 66 days. But wait, maybe I should check with another method. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or calculate the number of weeks and days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that April 10 is a Sunday. Let's list the days of the week for each date. But that might take too long. Alternatively, since I know that April 10 is Sunday, then April 11 is Monday, and so on. Let me think about how many weeks and extra days there are in the period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let's proceed with that approach.\n\nTotal days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is 66 days. Now, how many weekends are in this period? Weekends are Sundays and Saturdays. So I need to count how many Sundays and Saturdays are in this period.\n\nBut since April 10 is a Sunday, the first day is a Sunday. Let's see:\n\nApril 10: Sunday\n\nApril 11: Monday\n\n...\n\nApril 17: Saturday\n\nApril 18: Sunday\n\nSo in April, the Sundays would be April 10, 17, 24, and 31. Wait, April has 30 days, so April 30 is a Monday? Wait, let me check. April 10 is Sunday. April 17 is Saturday (since 10 + 7 days is 17, which is Saturday). Then April 18 is Sunday. Then April 25 is Sunday, and April 30 is a Monday. Wait, April 25 is Sunday, then April 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, if April 10 is Sunday, then April 17 is Saturday (10 + 7 days). Then April 18 is Sunday. Then April 25 is Sunday again. Then April 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. So April 30 is Friday. So in April, the Sundays are 10, 17, 24, and then 31? But April only has 30 days. So April 31 doesn't exist. So April has Sundays on 10, 17, 24. That's three Sundays in April. Then May has 31 days. May 1 is a Monday (since April 30 is Friday, so May 1 is Saturday? Wait, wait, April 30 is Friday. So May 1 is Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting with earlier. Wait, if April 10 is Sunday, then April 17 is Saturday. Then April 18 is Sunday. Then April 25 is Sunday. Then April 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. So May 1 is Saturday. So May 1 is Saturday. Then May 2 is Sunday. So in May, the Sundays would be May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five Sundays. Then June 1 is a Wednesday (since May 30 is Sunday, so May 31 is Monday, June 1 is Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, May 30 is Sunday. May 31 is Monday. June 1 is Tuesday. Wait, that's correct. So June 1 is Tuesday. Then June 2 is Wednesday, June 3 is Thursday, June 4 is Friday, June 5 is Saturday, June 6 is Sunday. So in June, the Sundays are June 5, 12, 19, 26. But the end date is June 14, so only up to June 14. So in June, the Sundays are June 5 and 12. So total Sundays in the period are April 10, 17, 24 (three), May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (five), and June 5, 12 (two). So total Sundays: 3 + 5 + 2 = 10 Sundays.\n\nNow, Saturdays. Let's count the Saturdays. April 17 (Saturday), April 24 (Saturday), May 1 (Saturday), May 8, 15, 22, 29 (May has 31 days, so May 29 is Saturday. Then June 5 is Sunday, so June 6 is Sunday, June 5 is Saturday? Wait, June 1 is Tuesday, so June 5 is Saturday. Then June 5 is Saturday, June 12 is Saturday, June 19 is Saturday, etc. But the end date is June 14, so in June, the Saturdays are June 5 and 12. So in April, the Saturdays are 17, 24. In May, the Saturdays are 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's five. Then in June, 5 and 12. So total Saturdays: 2 (April) + 5 (May) + 2 (June) = 9 Saturdays.\n\nSo total weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are 10 Sundays + 9 Saturdays = 19 days.\n\nTotal days in the period is 66. So weekdays would be 66 - 19 = 47 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, 66 total days minus 19 weekends equals 47 weekdays. But let me verify this with another approach to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, since April 10 is Sunday, and the period includes that day. Let's count the number of weekdays starting from April 10.\n\nApril 10 is Sunday (weekend). April 11 is Monday (weekday). April 12 is Tuesday. April 13 is Wednesday. April 14 is Thursday. April 15 is Friday. April 16 is Saturday (weekend). April 17 is Sunday (weekend). April 18 is Monday. So in April, from April 10 to April 30, how many weekdays?\n\nFrom April 10 (Sunday) to April 15 (Friday) is 6 days. April 10 is Sunday, so the weekdays are 11-15 (Monday to Friday) which is 5 days. Then April 16 is Saturday, 17 Sunday. Then April 18 is Monday again. So from April 18 to April 30, that's 13 days (April 18 to April 30 inclusive). Let's count the weekdays in that period. April 18 (Monday) to April 30 (Friday). Let's see: April 18 (Mon), 19 (Tue), 20 (Wed), 21 (Thu), 22 (Fri), 23 (Sat), 24 (Sun), 25 (Mon), 26 (Tue), 27 (Wed), 28 (Thu), 29 (Fri), 30 (Sat). Wait, April 30 is Saturday. So from April 18 to April 30, there are 13 days. The weekdays are Mon-Fri, so 5 days (18-22), then 25-29 (5 days), and then 30 is Saturday. So that's 5 + 5 = 10 weekdays. So total in April: 5 (from 11-15) + 10 (from 18-30) = 15 weekdays.\n\nThen May has 31 days. May 1 is Saturday. So May 1 is Saturday, May 2 is Sunday. So the first weekday in May is May 3 (Monday). Let's count the number of weekdays in May. May has 31 days. Since May 1 is Saturday, May 2 is Sunday, May 3 is Monday. So the weekdays in May are from May 3 to May 31, except the weekends. Let's calculate the number of weeks in May. May has 31 days. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks have 4*5=20 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days are May 31 (which is a Friday?), wait, let me check. May 3 is Monday. May 10 is Monday, 17, 24, 31. So May 31 is a Monday? Wait, May 3 is Monday, then May 10 is Monday, 17, 24, 31. So May 31 is Monday. Wait, but that would mean that May 31 is a Monday. But May has 31 days. So if May 3 is Monday, then May 31 is Monday. So the remaining days after 4 weeks (28 days) would be May 29 (Monday), 30 (Tuesday), 31 (Wednesday). Wait, that's three days. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nIf May 1 is Saturday, then May 2 is Sunday, May 3 is Monday. So the first day of the week is Monday. So May 3 is Monday, May 4 Tuesday, etc. So the last day of May is May 31. Let's find out what day of the week May 31 is. Since May 3 is Monday, adding 28 days (4 weeks) gets to May 31 (since 3 + 28 = 31). So May 31 is Monday. So the last three days of May are May 29 (Monday), 30 (Tuesday), 31 (Wednesday). So in May, the number of weekdays is 4 weeks (28 days) which is 4*5=20 weekdays, plus the three days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) which are all weekdays. So total 20 + 3 = 23 weekdays in May.\n\nThen June 1 to June 14. June 1 is Tuesday. June 14 is Tuesday. Let's count the weekdays in June. June 1 is Tuesday, 2 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, 8 Tuesday, 9 Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday, 13 Sunday, 14 Monday. Wait, but the end date is June 14, which is Monday. So from June 1 to June 14, that's 14 days. Let's count the weekdays. The days are:\n\nJune 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon).\n\nSo the weekdays are June 1-4 (Tue-Fri), 7-11 (Mon-Fri), and 14 (Mon). That's 4 days + 5 days + 1 day = 10 weekdays. Wait, but June 14 is included. So that's 10 weekdays in June.\n\nSo total weekdays would be April (15) + May (23) + June (10) = 15 + 23 = 38 + 10 = 48. Wait, but earlier calculation said 47. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in one of the counts. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, April's weekdays: 15. Let me recount. From April 10 (Sunday) to April 30 (Saturday). The weekdays are:\n\nApril 11 (Mon), 12 (Tue), 13 (Wed), 14 (Thu), 15 (Fri) \u2192 5 days.\n\nThen April 18 (Mon), 19 (Tue), 20 (Wed), 21 (Thu), 22 (Fri) \u2192 5 days.\n\nApril 25 (Mon), 26 (Tue), 27 (Wed), 28 (Thu), 29 (Fri) \u2192 5 days.\n\nApril 30 is Saturday, so that's the end. So that's 5 + 5 + 5 = 15. Correct.\n\nMay: 23 weekdays. Let me check again. May has 31 days. May 1 is Saturday. So the first weekday is May 3 (Monday). The last day is May 31 (Monday). So the number of weeks is 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days. So 4*5=20 weekdays in the 28 days. Then the remaining 3 days (May 29, 30, 31) are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. All weekdays. So 20 + 3 = 23. Correct.\n\nJune: from June 1 (Tuesday) to June 14 (Monday). The weekdays are:\n\nJune 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 14 (Mon). Wait, that's 10 days. Let me list them:\n\nJune 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 14 (Mon). That's 10 weekdays. So June has 10 weekdays. So total is 15 + 23 + 10 = 48.\n\nBut earlier calculation said total days is 66, minus 19 weekends (10 Sundays + 9 Saturdays) equals 47. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total days is not 66. Let me check that again. April 10 to June 14 inclusive. April has 30 days. From April 10 to April 30 is 21 days (30 - 10 + 1 = 21). May has 31 days. June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. That's correct. So 66 days total. If there are 19 weekends, then 66 - 19 = 47 weekdays. But according to the per-month count, it's 48. So there's a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check the weekends again. Earlier, I counted 10 Sundays and 9 Saturdays. Let's recount.\n\nSundays in the period:\n\nApril 10, 17, 24 (three Sundays in April).\n\nMay 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 (five Sundays in May).\n\nJune 5, 12 (two Sundays in June).\n\nTotal Sundays: 3 + 5 + 2 = 10. Correct.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nApril 17, 24 (two in April).\n\nMay 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (five in May).\n\nJune 5, 12 (two in June).\n\nTotal Saturdays: 2 + 5 + 2 = 9. Correct.\n\nTotal weekends: 10 + 9 = 19. So 66 - 19 = 47. But the per-month count says 48. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe the per-month count is wrong. Let me check June again. June 1 is Tuesday. June 14 is Tuesday."], [74, "What day of the week was December 20, 2022? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to find out what day of the week December 20, 2022 was. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know the day of the week for a date I'm certain about. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me confirm that. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me check that again. Hmm, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I remember that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if that's the case, then maybe I can count backward from there.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. Let me think. If December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday, then December 20 would be two days before that. So December 21 is Wednesday, so December 20 would be Tuesday. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. If December 21 is Wednesday, then December 20 would be Tuesday. But I need to make sure that December 21, 2022 was indeed a Wednesday. How can I confirm that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that right? Let me think. July 4, 2022: I think that was a Monday. If that's correct, then I can count the days from July 4 to December 20 and see what day of the week that would be.\n\nBut maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's try to count the days from a known date. Let's say I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. Let me try to count the days from a known date. For example, if I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday, then December 20 would be Tuesday. But how do I confirm that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or logical calculations. Let me try to use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I go back from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2022, that's 365 days. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Because January 1, 2023 is Sunday, so December 31, 2022 is one day before, which is Saturday. Then, December 31 is Saturday. So December 30 is Friday, December 29 is Thursday, December 28 is Wednesday, December 27 is Tuesday, December 26 is Monday, December 25 is Sunday, December 24 is Saturday, December 23 is Friday, December 22 is Thursday, December 21 is Wednesday. So that would mean December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Therefore, December 20 would be Tuesday. So the answer would be Tuesday.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If December 31 is Saturday, then December 30 is Friday, December 29 is Thursday, December 28 is Wednesday, December 27 is Tuesday, December 26 is Monday, December 25 is Sunday, December 24 is Saturday, December 23 is Friday, December 22 is Thursday, December 21 is Wednesday. Yes, that seems correct. So December 20 would be two days before Wednesday, which is Tuesday. Therefore, December 20, 2022 was a Tuesday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's take a known date in 2022. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's count the days from July 4 to December 20. July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September 30, October 31, November 30, and December 20. Let's add them up. July 4 to July 31: 27 days. August: 31, September: 30, October: 31, November: 30, December 20: 20. Total days from July 4 to December 20 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 20 = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 30 is 149, plus 20 is 169 days. Now, 169 days later. Since each week has 7 days, 169 divided by 7 is 24 weeks and 1 day. So if July 4 is a Monday, adding 169 days would be 24 weeks and 1 day, so the day of the week would be Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. Therefore, December 20, 2022 would be a Tuesday. That matches the previous calculation. So that seems to confirm that the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Is 2014 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2014 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it's a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2014. First, divide 2014 by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2014 minus 2000 is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3.5, which means 2014 is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should do the division properly. 4 times 503 is 2012, so 2014 minus 2012 is 2. So remainder 2. Therefore, 2014 is not divisible by 4. That means it can't be a leap year, right? Because the first condition is not met. So even though 2014 isn't a century year, since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [74, "In a year where Sunday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 11. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the weekday of April 11th in a year where January 1st is a Sunday. So I need to figure out what day of the week April 11th falls on, given that January 1st is a Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of days between January 1st and April 11th. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, but since it's not mentioned, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that doesn't depend on leap years? Wait, but the answer might depend on that. Wait, but the problem says \"in a year where Sunday is January 1st\"\u2014so maybe the year is not a leap year? Or maybe it's a leap year? Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, but maybe the answer is the same regardless? Or maybe I need to assume a non-leap year because the problem doesn't mention it. Let me check.\n\nWait, if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume a non-leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption. So, January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, March has 31 days, and then April 11th is 11 days into April. So total days from January 1st to April 11th would be 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 11 is 100 days. Wait, but wait, that's from January 1st to April 11th inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So the number of days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days? Wait, let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is day 0 (Sunday). Then January 2nd is day 1 (Monday), and so on. So to get to April 11th, we need to count how many days after January 1st. So:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days gets us to March 1st. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days gets us to April 1st. Then April 11th is 10 days after April 1st. So total days from January 1st to April 11th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 10 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 10 is 99 days. Wait, that's 99 days. Wait, but earlier I thought 100. Which is correct?\n\nWait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is 0 days. Then January 2nd is 1 day, ..., January 31st is 30 days. Then February 1st is 31 days. Then February 28th is 31 + 28 - 1 = 58 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then February 1st is day 31. Then February 28th is day 31 + 27 = 58. Then March 1st is day 59. March has 31 days, so March 31st is day 59 + 30 = 89. Then April 1st is day 90. Then April 11th is day 90 + 10 = 100. Wait, so that's 100 days. So why did I get 99 before? Because I added 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 10 (Apr) = 99. But that's wrong. Because the days from January 1st to April 11th is 100 days. Because January 1st is day 0, so April 11th is 100 days later. So the total number of days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days. So that's 100 days after Sunday.\n\nNow, to find the weekday, we can calculate 100 days later. Since each week has 7 days, we can divide 100 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell us how many days ahead we are from Sunday.\n\nSo 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks (14*7=98) with a remainder of 2. So 100 days later is 14 weeks and 2 days. So starting from Sunday, adding 2 days would be Monday (Sunday +1) and Tuesday (Sunday +2). Therefore, April 11th would be a Tuesday.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. If January 1st is Sunday, then January 8th is also Sunday (7 days later). So adding 7 days brings us back to the same day. So 100 days is 14*7=98 days, which is 14 weeks, so 98 days later is also Sunday. Then 2 more days would be Monday (98+1) and Tuesday (98+2). So April 11th is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st: 0 (Sunday)\nJanuary 2nd: 1 (Monday)\n...\nJanuary 31st: 30 (Saturday)\nFebruary 1st: 31 (Sunday)\nFebruary 28th: 31 + 27 = 58 (Sunday)\nMarch 1st: 59 (Monday)\nMarch 31st: 59 + 30 = 89 (Wednesday)\nApril 1st: 90 (Thursday)\nApril 11th: 90 + 10 = 100 (Thursday + 10 days). Wait, but if April 1st is Thursday, then adding 10 days would be:\n\nApril 1: Thursday\nApril 2: Friday\nApril 3: Saturday\nApril 4: Sunday\nApril 5: Monday\nApril 6: Tuesday\nApril 7: Wednesday\nApril 8: Thursday\nApril 9: Friday\nApril 10: Saturday\nApril 11: Sunday\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. So according to this, April 11th would be Sunday. But earlier calculation said 100 days later is Tuesday. There's a contradiction here. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The number of days between January 1st and April 11th is not 100 days. Let me recount. If January 1st is day 0, then April 11th is day 100. But when I count the days step by step, April 1st is day 90. So April 11th is day 90 + 10 = 100. But when I count the days from April 1st (Thursday) to April 11th, that's 10 days later. So if April 1st is Thursday, then adding 10 days would be:\n\nApril 1: Thursday (day 90)\nApril 2: Friday (91)\nApril 3: Saturday (92)\nApril 4: Sunday (93)\nApril 5: Monday (94)\nApril 6: Tuesday (95)\nApril 7: Wednesday (96)\nApril 8: Thursday (97)\nApril 9: Friday (98)\nApril 10: Saturday (99)\nApril 11: Sunday (100)\n\nSo according to this, April 11th is Sunday. But earlier calculation said that 100 days later is Tuesday. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because when I calculated 100 days later, I thought that 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 2 days. But if January 1st is Sunday, then 7 days later is Sunday again. So 14 weeks later is also Sunday. Then 100 days is 14*7=98 days, so 98 days later is Sunday. Then 2 more days would be Monday (98+1) and Tuesday (98+2). But according to the step-by-step count, April 11th is Sunday. So there's a mistake here. Where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe the mistake is in the initial assumption of the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 11th.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days gets us to March 1st (day 30 + 28 = 58). Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days gets us to April 1st (day 58 + 31 = 89). Then April 11th is 10 days after April 1st, so day 89 + 10 = 99. Wait, so that's 99 days. But earlier I thought it was 100. So that's the mistake. So the correct number of days is 99 days. So 99 days later. Then 99 divided by 7 is 14 weeks (98 days) with a remainder of 1. So 99 days later is 14 weeks and 1 day. So Sunday + 1 day is Monday. But according to the step-by-step count, April 11th is Sunday. So now there's a contradiction again. What's going on here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the number of days. Let me do it again. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 11th.\n\nJanuary 1st is day 0 (Sunday).\n\nJanuary 1st to January 31st: 31 days. So January 31st is day 30 (since day 0 is Jan 1st). Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 30 + 28 = 58. March has 31 days, so March 31st is day 58 + 31 = 89. Then April 1st is day 90. April 11th is day 90 + 10 = 100. Wait, but that's 100 days. But when I count step by step, April 11th is Sunday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the step-by-step count. Let me check again. If April 1st is Thursday (day 90), then adding 10 days:\n\nApril 1: Thursday (90)\nApril 2: Friday (91)\nApril 3: Saturday (92)\nApril 4: Sunday (93)\nApril 5: Monday (94)\nApril 6: Tuesday (95)\nApril 7: Wednesday (96)\nApril 8: Thursday (97)\nApril 9: Friday (98)\nApril 10: Saturday (99)\nApril 11: Sunday (100)\n\nSo that's 10 days later, which is day 100. So April 11th is Sunday. But according to the 99 days calculation, 99 days later would be 14 weeks and 1 day. But 99 days is 14*7=98, so 98 days later is Sunday (day 98), then 99 days later is Monday. But according to the step-by-step, it's Sunday. So why is there a difference?\n\nAh! Because the number of days between January 1st and April 11th is 100 days, but when you count the days from January 1st (day 0) to April 11th (day 100), that's 100 days later. So the number of days between them is 100 days. So the difference is 100 days. So 100 days later. So 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 14 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step count, it's Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the assumption that January 1st is day 0. Let me check with a different approach. Let's use a known date. For example, if January 1st is Sunday, then January 8th is also Sunday. Let's check the day of the week for April 11th.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 1st is day 59 (since January 1st is day 0, January 31st is day 30, February 28th is day 58, March 1st is day 59). So March 1st is day 59. If January 1st is Sunday, then March 1st is 59 days later. Let's calculate 59 mod 7. 59 divided by 7 is 8*7=56, remainder 3. So 59 days later is 3 days after Sunday, which is Wednesday. So March 1st is Wednesday. Then March 1st is Wednesday. Then March 8th is Wednesday, March 15th is Wednesday, March 22nd is Wednesday, March 29th is Wednesday. April 5th is Wednesday. Then April 5th is Wednesday. Then April 6th is Thursday, April 7th is Friday, April 8th is Saturday, April 9th is Sunday, April 10th is Monday, April 11th is Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous step-by-step count. So according to this, April 11th is Tuesday. But earlier step-by-step count said Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check again. If March 1st is Wednesday, then March 1st is Wednesday. Then March 8th is Wednesday, March 15th is Wednesday, March 22nd is Wednesday, March 29th is Wednesday. Then April 5th is Wednesday. So April 5th is Wednesday. Then April 6th is Thursday, April 7th is Friday, April 8th is Saturday, April 9th is Sunday, April 10th is Monday, April 11th is Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday. But earlier when I counted from April 1st as Thursday, adding 10 days, I got Sunday. So why the difference?\n\nAh! Because if March 1st is Wednesday, then April 1st is 31 days later. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 1st is Wednesday, so April 1st is Wednesday + 3 days = Saturday. Wait, but earlier I thought April 1st was Thursday. That's the mistake! So where did I get April 1st as Thursday? That was wrong. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIf March 1st is Wednesday (day 59), then March has 31 days. So March 31st is day 59 + 30 = 89. Then April 1st is day 90. So day 90 is 89 + 1 = 90. Now, March 1st is Wednesday. March 1st is day 59. So day 59 is Wednesday. Then day 59 + 31 = day 90 is April 1st. 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. So April 1st is Saturday. Then April 1st is Saturday. Then April 11th is 10 days later. Let's count:\n\nApril 1: Saturday\nApril 2: Sunday\nApril 3: Monday\nApril 4: Tuesday\nApril 5: Wednesday\nApril 6: Thursday\nApril 7: Friday\nApril 8: Saturday\nApril 9: Sunday\nApril 10: Monday\nApril 11: Tuesday\n\nSo April 11th is Tuesday. That matches the previous calculation. So where was the mistake in the earlier step-by-step count? Earlier, I thought April 1st was Thursday, but that was incorrect. The correct day is Saturday. So that's the error. So the correct answer is Tuesday.\n\nSo the initial mistake was in the step-by-step count where I thought April 1st was Thursday, but actually it's Saturday. Therefore, April 11th is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [74, "Between Tuesday, January 25, 2022 and Tuesday, March 29, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, January 25, 2022, and Tuesday, March 29, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me check the dates. January 25 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think January 25, 2022 was a Tuesday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can count the days or use a calendar. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down into months. From January 25 to January 31, then February, then March 1 to March 29.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days between the two dates. Let's start with January 25, 2022, and go to March 29, 2022.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 25 to January 31 is 31 - 25 + 1 = 7 days. Wait, because inclusive. So January 25 is day 1, January 26 is day 2, ..., January 31 is day 7. So that's 7 days in January.\n\nThen February 2022 has 28 days because 2022 is not a leap year. So February has 28 days.\n\nThen March 1 to March 29 is 29 days (including both ends). So total days would be 7 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 29 (Mar) = 64 days total.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Wait, January 25 to January 31 is 7 days. Then February is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So 7 + 28 is 35, plus 29 is 64. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 64 days.\n\nNow, out of these 64 days, how many are weekends? Let's figure out how many Saturdays and Sundays there are.\n\nStarting from January 25, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let's list the days of the week for each month.\n\nJanuary 25 is Tuesday. So January 25 (Tue), 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri), 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon). So in January, the weekends are January 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun). That's 2 weekend days in January.\n\nThen February 2022 starts on a Tuesday (since January 31 is Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday). Wait, January 31 is Monday, so February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, etc. So in February, the weekends are every 7 days. Since February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks. So there are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. So 8 weekend days in February.\n\nThen March 1, 2022 is a Tuesday (since February 28 is a Monday, so March 1 is Tuesday). So March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, etc. Now, March 29 is the end date. Let's check how many weekends are in March.\n\nMarch has 29 days. Let's count the number of Saturdays and Sundays. Starting from March 1 (Tuesday), the first weekend is March 5 (Sat) and 6 (Sun). Then next is March 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), then 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), then 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Then March 29 is a Tuesday. So the last weekend in March would be March 26 and 27. So that's 3 weekends in March (each weekend is 2 days, so 3*2=6 days). Wait, but March has 29 days. Let me check again.\n\nMarch 1 is Tuesday. So:\n\nWeek 1: March 1 (Tue) to March 7 (Mon). Weekends: March 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun).\n\nWeek 2: March 8 (Tue) to March 14 (Mon). Weekends: 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun).\n\nWeek 3: March 15 (Tue) to March 21 (Mon). Weekends: 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun).\n\nWeek 4: March 22 (Tue) to March 28 (Mon). Weekends: 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun).\n\nThen March 29 is Tuesday. So that's 4 weeks, each with 2 weekend days. So 4*2=8 weekend days. Wait, but March has 29 days. Wait, March 29 is the 29th day. So the last week would be March 22-28, which is 7 days. Then March 29 is the next day. So in March, there are 4 weekends (each 2 days) = 8 days. But wait, March 29 is a Tuesday, so the last weekend is March 26 and 27. So that's 4 weekends. So 4*2=8 days. But wait, March has 29 days. So March 29 is a Tuesday. So the total days in March are 29, which is 4 weeks (28 days) plus 1 day. So the first 28 days of March are 4 weeks, and the 29th is an extra day (Tuesday). So the weekends in March are 4*2=8 days. So that's 8 weekend days in March.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period: January (2) + February (8) + March (8) = 18 days.\n\nSo total business days would be total days (64) minus weekends (18) = 46 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nWait, in January, the weekends are 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun) \u2014 that's 2 days. Then February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks, so 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays, that's 8 days. March has 29 days, which is 4 weeks and 1 day. So the weekends in March are 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays, which is 8 days. So total weekends are 2 + 8 + 8 = 18. So 64 total days minus 18 weekend days is 46 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the total days and subtract the weekends. But maybe I should verify the total days again.\n\nWait, the start date is January 25, 2022 (Tuesday), and the end date is March 29, 2022 (Tuesday). Let me check how many days are between them.\n\nJanuary 25 to January 31: 7 days.\n\nFebruary: 28 days.\n\nMarch 1 to March 29: 29 days.\n\nTotal: 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days. That's correct.\n\nNow, the total number of weekends is 18. So 64 - 18 = 46. So the answer should be 46.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the weekend count. Let me check again.\n\nIn January, the weekends are 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun). That's 2 days.\n\nIn February, since it starts on Tuesday, February 1 is Tuesday. So the weekends are 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 8 days. Correct.\n\nIn March, March 1 is Tuesday. So the weekends are 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 8 days. So March has 8 weekend days. So total 2 + 8 + 8 = 18. So 64 - 18 = 46.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. For example, the number of weeks between the two dates. Since the start and end dates are both Tuesdays, the total number of days is 64. So 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. So 9 weeks is 63 days, plus 1 day. So 9 weeks would have 9*5 = 45 business days, plus 1 day (which is a Tuesday, so a business day). So total 45 + 1 = 46. That matches the previous calculation. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of business days is 46.", "46"], [74, "If a meeting is scheduled on the last Saturday of December 2022, on which day of the month does it occur? Give the count numerically. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out on which date in December 2022 the last Saturday falls. Let me start by recalling that December has 31 days. The key here is to determine the day of the week for December 31, 2022, because if that's a Saturday, then that's the last Saturday. But if it's not, I need to check the previous days.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week December 31, 2022, was. Wait, I might not remember that. Maybe I can use a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2023, was a Sunday. Let me count backwards. December 31, 2022, would be the day before January 1, 2023. So if January 1, 2023, is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022, would be a Saturday. Wait, that makes sense because the day before Sunday is Saturday. So that means December 31, 2022, is a Saturday. Therefore, the last Saturday of December 2022 is December 31. But wait, let me confirm that. Let me check another way. Maybe I can check a calendar or use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the first Saturday of December 2022. Let's say December 1, 2022. What day was that? If I can figure that out, then I can count the weeks. But I might not remember that. Alternatively, I can use the fact that December 31 is a Saturday. So if that's the case, then the last Saturday is the 31st. But maybe I should verify this with another approach.\n\nAnother way: Let's check the number of days in December. December has 31 days. If December 31 is a Saturday, then that's the last Saturday. But if it's not, then the last Saturday would be the 24th, 25th, etc., depending on the day. Wait, but if December 31 is a Saturday, then that's the last one. So the answer would be 31. But I need to make sure that December 31, 2022, is indeed a Saturday.\n\nAlternatively, I can check an online calendar or use a date calculator. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think again. If January 1, 2023, is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022, is a Saturday. That seems correct. So the last Saturday of December 2022 is December 31. Therefore, the answer should be 31. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another date. For example, if I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. If December 1 is a Thursday, then December 2 is Friday, 3 is Saturday. So the first Saturday is the 3rd. Then the next Saturdays would be 10th, 17th, 24th, and 31st. So that would make the last Saturday the 31st. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 31.

Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to find out what day of the week November 15, 2022 was. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I should check if I know any dates in 2022 that I can use as a reference. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that again. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think. 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should look up a calendar or use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that November 15, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about some known dates. For example, I know that November 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's start from a known date. For example, if I know that November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday, but I need to verify that. Wait, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think. If I can find the day of the week for a date in 2022 that I know, then I can count forward or backward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or calculations. Let me try to recall. I think that November 15, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to count the days from a known date.\n\nFor example, let's take July 4, 2022. I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. July 4, 2022: if July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then adding days to get to November 15. Let's see. July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September has 30, and October has 31. Then November 15 is 15 days into November. So total days from July 4 to November 15 would be 27 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 15 (November) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 15 is 134 days. Wait, but that's from July 4 to November 15 inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if July 4 is day 0, then adding 134 days would get to November 15. But if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 134 days would be 134 days later. Since 134 divided by 7 is 19 weeks and 1 day. So 19 weeks later is the same day, plus 1 day. So if July 4 is Monday, then November 15 would be Tuesday. So that would mean November 15, 2022 was a Tuesday. But I need to confirm if July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me think again. July 4, 2022: I remember that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2022 is one year later, so adding 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So July 4, 2022 would be a Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, if July 4, 2021 was a Monday, then July 4, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But earlier I thought July 4, 2022 was a Monday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me check. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 would start on a Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 was a Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 would start on a Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous thought. I think I need to get this straight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 15, 2022 was a Tuesday. But I need to verify. Alternatively, I can use the fact that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday, then November 15 would be 21 - 15 = 6 days earlier in November. Wait, no, November 15 to December 21 is 16 days (November 15 to November 30 is 15 days, plus 21 days in December? Wait, no. Wait, November has 30 days. So from November 15 to November 30 is 15 days. Then December 1 to December 21 is 21 days. So total is 15 + 21 = 36 days. So 36 days from November 15 to December 21. 36 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 1 day. So if December 21 is a Wednesday, then November 15 would be 1 day earlier, which is Tuesday. So that would mean November 15, 2022 was a Tuesday.

Then December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday. So the first Thursday in December is the 29th? That can't be correct because December 1 is a Thursday? Wait, no, if December 29 is a Thursday, then December 28 is Wednesday, 27 Tuesday, 26 Monday, 25 Sunday, 24 Saturday, 23 Friday, 22 Thursday. Wait, that would mean the first Thursday is the 22nd?

But that would mean that December 1 is a Friday? Wait, that can't be. Because if December 29 is Thursday, then December 28 is Wednesday, 27 Tuesday, 26 Monday, 25 Sunday, 24 Saturday, 23 Friday, 22 Thursday. So the first Thursday is the 22nd.

So that would mean the first Thursday is the 7th. But according to the previous calculation, the first Thursday is the 29th. That's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual days. Let me try to count from December 31, 2022, which is Saturday. Then December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday. So the first Thursday is the 29th. But that would mean that December 1 is a Friday. Let's count from December 29 (Thursday) backwards. December 29 is Thursday. December 28 is Wednesday, 27 Tuesday, 26 Monday, 25 Sunday, 24 Saturday, 23 Friday, 22 Thursday. So the first Thursday is the 22nd. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous statement. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if December 29 is Thursday, then December 22 is also a Thursday. So that would mean that the first Thursday is the 22nd, the second is the 29th, and the third would be the 5th of January 2023. But that's not in December. So that would mean that December has only two Thursdays? But that's impossible because December has 31 days. So there must be three Thursdays in December. Therefore, my previous assumption that December 29 is Thursday must be wrong. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's check the actual calendar for December 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use an online source or my memory. Wait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the first Thursday is the 1st, the second is the 8th, the third is the 15th. So the answer would be 15. But how do I confirm that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023, is a Sunday. So December 31, 2022, is a Saturday. Then December 31 is Saturday. So December 30 is Friday, 29 is Thursday. So if December 29 is Thursday, then December 22 is also Thursday. So that would mean that the first Thursday is the 22nd? But that contradicts the idea that December 1 is a Thursday. So there's a problem here. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual day of the week for December 1, 2022. Let me think. If I know that December 31, 2022, is a Saturday, then December 1 is 30 days before. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if December 31 is Saturday, then December 1 is 30 days earlier. Subtracting 28 days (4 weeks) would bring me to December 3, 2022, which is also a Saturday. Then subtracting 2 more days would be December 1, which would be Thursday. So that makes sense. So December 1 is a Thursday. Therefore, the first Thursday is the 1st, the second is the 8th, the third is the 15th. Therefore, the answer should be 15. But earlier when I counted from December 31, I thought that December 29 is Thursday, but that must be wrong. Wait, if December 1 is Thursday, then December 29 is 28 days later, which is 4 weeks, so also a Thursday. So December 29 is Thursday. So that would mean that the first Thursday is the 1st, the second is the 8th, third is the 15th, fourth is the 22nd, fifth is the 29th. So that's five Thursdays in December. So the third one is the 15th. Therefore, the answer is 15. So I think that's correct. So the third Thursday in December 2022 is the 15th.", "15"], [74, "If today is Friday, March 11, 2022, what day of the week was it 58 days ago? Provide the full name of the weekday.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what day of the week it was 58 days ago, given that today is Friday, March 11, 2022. I need to figure out the day by counting backward 58 days from today.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 58 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days that is. Let me do that calculation. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks with a remainder. 7 times 8 is 56, so 58 minus 56 is 2. So that means 58 days ago is the same as 8 weeks and 2 days ago. Since 8 weeks is exactly 56 days, subtracting that from 58 leaves 2 days. So I need to go back 2 days from Friday.\n\nWait, but wait. If today is Friday, then going back one day would be Thursday, and two days ago would be Wednesday. So 58 days ago should be a Wednesday? But wait, maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the date? Wait, but the problem is just about the day of the week, not the actual date. So even if there are different months with different numbers of days, the day of the week would still cycle every 7 days. So regardless of the actual dates, subtracting 58 days is equivalent to subtracting 2 days from Friday. So that would be Wednesday. But let me double-check. Maybe I should count the days step by step to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the current date: March 11, 2022 is a Friday. Let's count backward. Let's see, March has 31 days. So if I go back 58 days, maybe I can subtract months and days. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, since 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 2 days, then subtracting 2 days from Friday would be Wednesday. But maybe I should check with a different approach. For example, if I go back 56 days (8 weeks), that would be March 11 minus 56 days. Let's calculate that. March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 56 days. Let's subtract 31 days first: March 11 minus 31 days would be December 11, 2021. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, March 11 minus 31 days would be February 11, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, March 11 minus 31 days would be February 11, 2022? Wait, March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 31 days would be February 11, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, if today is March 11, then subtracting 31 days would take us back to February 11, 2022. Because March 11 minus 1 day is March 10, minus 2 days is March 9, etc. But 31 days would take us back to February 11. Then subtract another 25 days (since 56 days is 31 + 25). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should just trust the modulo calculation. Since 58 divided by 7 is 8 with remainder 2, so 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday. So Friday minus 1 day is Thursday, minus 2 days is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be Wednesday. But maybe I should check with an actual calendar or a date calculator. Wait, but since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for March 11, 2022. Wait, the user says that today is Friday, March 11, 2022. So if I go back 58 days, that's 58 days before March 11, 2022. Let me try to count the days. Let's break it down into months. March has 31 days. So March 11 minus 58 days. Let's subtract 31 days first: March 11 minus 31 days is February 11, 2022. Then subtract another 27 days (since 31 + 27 = 58). February 11 minus 27 days. February has 28 days in 2022 (since 2022 is not a leap year). So February 11 minus 27 days would be January 14, 2022. Wait, because February 11 minus 1 day is February 10, minus 2 days is February 9, etc. Let me count: February 11 minus 27 days. Let's subtract 28 days to get to January 11, 2022, but that's 28 days. So subtracting 27 days would be January 12, 2022. Wait, no. Wait, if I subtract 28 days from February 11, that would be January 11. So subtracting 27 days would be January 12. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. Let's take February 11, 2022. If I subtract 27 days, how many days are left in February? February has 28 days. So February 11 minus 27 days would be January 14, 2022? Wait, maybe I should count step by step. Let's start from February 11, 2022. Subtract 1 day: February 10. Subtract 2 days: February 9. ... Subtract 27 days: February 11 minus 27 days. Let's see, February has 28 days. So February 11 minus 27 days is January 14, 2022? Because February 11 minus 28 days is January 11, so minus 27 days would be January 12? Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's use the fact that 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday. So if today is Friday, then 58 days ago is Wednesday. But maybe I should check with another method. Let's check the day of the week for March 11, 2022. If I know that March 11, 2022 is a Friday, then 58 days before that would be 58 days earlier. Let me check the day of the week for March 11, 2022. Wait, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but I might not remember that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 11, 2022 is a Friday. So if I go back 58 days, which is 8 weeks and 2 days, then 8 weeks ago would be the same day, Friday. Then subtract 2 days: Friday minus 2 days is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be Wednesday. But I need to make sure that there are no errors in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can check the number of days in each month. Let's try to count backward from March 11, 2022. Let's subtract 58 days. Let's break it down into months. March has 31 days. So March 11 minus 58 days. Let's subtract 31 days to get to February 11, 2022. Then subtract another 27 days. February has 28 days in 2022. So February 11 minus 27 days would be January 14, 2022. Wait, because February 11 minus 28 days is January 11, so minus 27 days would be January 12. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe I should count the days step by step. Let's take February 11, 2022. Subtract 27 days. Let's count backwards: February 11 minus 1 day is February 10. Subtract 2 days: February 9. Subtract 3 days: February 8. ... Subtract 27 days. Let's see, February has 28 days. So February 11 minus 27 days is January 14, 2022? Because February 11 minus 28 days is January 11, so minus 27 days would be January 12. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's use the fact that 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday. So if today is Friday, then 58 days ago is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer is Wednesday. But I need to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for a known date. For example, if I know that March 11, 2022 is a Friday, then March 11 minus 7 days is February 14, 2022, which would also be a Friday. Then subtract another 7 days: February 7, 2022, also Friday. Subtract 7 days again: January 29, 2022, Friday. Subtract 7 days: January 22, 2022, Friday. Subtract 7 days: January 15, 2022, Friday. Subtract 7 days: December 29, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: December 22, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: December 15, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: December 8, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: December 1, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: November 24, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: November 17, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: November 10, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: November 3, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: October 27, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: October 20, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: October 13, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: October 6, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: September 29, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: September 22, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: September 15, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: September 8, 2021, Friday. Subtract 7 days: September 1, 2021, Friday. Now, from here, I need to count 58 days. Wait, but this is getting too long. Alternatively, since 58 days is 8 weeks and 2 days, then 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday, which is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be Wednesday. I think that's correct. So the final answer is Wednesday.", "Wednesday"], [74, "Name the day of the week for 10/16/2022.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. Wait, actually, I think January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If I recall, 2022 was a leap year? No, 2022 is not a leap year because 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, so not a whole number. So February had 28 days. So, if I can figure out the day of the week for a known date in 2022 and then count forward or backward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think of some other dates. For example, I know that October 16, 2021 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, maybe I should check a calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I go back from there. Let's see. Let's count the days between October 16, 2022 and January 1, 2023. Wait, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days and work backward.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let's start with a known date. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 is the date in question. Let me think of a date that I know the day of the week for. For example, I remember that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is the same as October 16, 2023, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I can figure out how many days are between October 16, 2022 and January 1, 2023, then I can subtract that number of days from Sunday to find the day of the week for October 16, 2022.\n\nLet me calculate the number of days between October 16, 2022 and January 1, 2023. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom October 16 to October 31: October has 31 days, so 31 - 16 = 15 days remaining in October after October 16. Then November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So total days from October 16 to December 31 is 15 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 76 days. Then January 1 is the next day. So total days from October 16 to January 1 is 76 days. Wait, but if October 16 is day 0, then October 17 is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between October 16 and January 1 is 76 days. Wait, but if I go from October 16 to October 31, that's 15 days (since October 16 is day 0, October 17 is day 1, ..., October 31 is day 15). Then November has 30 days (days 16 to 45), and December has 31 days (days 46 to 76). So January 1 is day 77. Therefore, the number of days between October 16 and January 1 is 77 days. Wait, but if January 1 is 77 days after October 16, then October 16 is 77 days before January 1. So if January 1 is a Sunday, then October 16 would be 77 days before that. Now, since 77 divided by 7 is 11 weeks exactly (7*11=77), so 77 days is exactly 11 weeks. Therefore, October 16 would be the same day of the week as January 1. But wait, that would mean October 16 is a Sunday. But wait, if January 1 is a Sunday, then October 16 is also a Sunday? That seems possible. But I need to check if my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. From October 16 to October 31: 31 - 16 = 15 days. Then November has 30 days, December has 31 days. So total days from October 16 to December 31 is 15 + 30 + 31 = 76 days. Then January 1 is the next day, so total days from October 16 to January 1 is 76 + 1 = 77 days. So if January 1 is a Sunday, then October 16 is 77 days before that. Since 77 divided by 7 is 11 weeks, so 77 days is exactly 11 weeks. Therefore, October 16 would be the same day of the week as January 1. Therefore, if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then October 16, 2022 is also a Sunday. But wait, I need to confirm if January 1, 2023 is indeed a Sunday. Let me think. I remember that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 was a leap year, so 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. Then 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2023 would be Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. Yes, that's correct. So January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Therefore, October 16, 2022 is also a Sunday. Therefore, the answer should be Sunday.", "Sunday"], [74, "What day of the week was November 28, 2022?

Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and count the days forward or backward.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. If I recall, 2022 was a leap year? No, 2022 is not a leap year because 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, so it's not divisible by 4. So February had 28 days. So January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If December 31, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. But how do I know what day December 31, 2022 was?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. Wait, July 4, 2022: if I count the days from a known date. Let's say July 4, 2022 is a Monday. Then, November 28 is how many days later?\n\nLet me calculate the number of days between July 4 and November 28. July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September has 30, October has 31, and November 28. So adding those up: 27 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 28 (November) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 28 is 147 days. Wait, but that's from July 4 to November 28 inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if July 4 is day 0, then adding 147 days would take me to November 28. But I need to check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the days between July 4 and November 28. Let's break it down:\n\nJuly: 31 days. From July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August has 31, September 30, October 31, and November 28. So total days from July 4 to November 28 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 28 = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 28 is 147 days. So 147 days after July 4, 2022.\n\nIf July 4 is a Monday, then adding 147 days. Since each week has 7 days, 147 divided by 7 is 21 weeks exactly. 21*7=147. So 147 days later would be the same day of the week. Therefore, November 28, 2022 would also be a Monday. Wait, but that seems too easy. But maybe that's correct?\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that November 28, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, but that's the question. Hmm. Maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I go back from there. Let's see, December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then November 28, 2022 is how many days before December 31? Let's calculate. From November 28 to November 30 is 2 days, then December 1 to December 31 is 31 days. So total 2 + 31 = 33 days. So 33 days before December 31, 2022 is November 28. So if December 31 is a Saturday, then November 28 would be 33 days earlier. 33 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 5 days. So subtracting 5 days from Saturday. Saturday minus 5 days is Monday. Because Saturday minus 1 day is Friday, minus 2 is Thursday, minus 3 is Wednesday, minus 4 is Tuesday, minus 5 is Monday. So that would mean November 28, 2022 was a Monday. So that matches the previous calculation.

I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, August 14, 2022, to Sunday, October 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by breaking it down into months and checking each week.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. August 14, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think August 14, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can count the days. But maybe I should just proceed step by step.\n\nSo the period starts on August 14 (Sunday) and ends on October 16 (Sunday). Let me break this into parts: August, September, and October.\n\nFirst, August. From August 14 to August 31. Let's count how many days that is. August 14 is Sunday. August 15 is Monday, and so on. Let's see:\n\nAugust has 31 days. So from August 14 to August 31 inclusive is 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days. Wait, 31 minus 14 is 17, plus 1 is 18 days. So that's 18 days in August.\n\nNow, let's check which of those days are business days. Since August 14 is a Sunday, the next day is Monday, August 15. So the first week in August would be August 14 (Sunday), 15 (Mon), 16 (Tue), 17 (Wed), 18 (Thu), 19 (Fri), 20 (Sat), 21 (Sun). Wait, but the period starts on August 14, so the first week includes August 14 (Sunday) and ends on August 21 (Sunday). But the total days in August from 14 to 31 is 18 days. Let me list them:\n\nAugust 14 (Sun), 15 (Mon), 16 (Tue), 17 (Wed), 18 (Thu), 19 (Fri), 20 (Sat), 21 (Sun), 22 (Mon), 23 (Tue), 24 (Wed), 25 (Thu), 26 (Fri), 27 (Sat), 28 (Sun), 29 (Mon), 30 (Tue), 31 (Wed).\n\nWait, that's 18 days. Let me count the business days here. From August 14 to August 31:\n\nWeek 1: August 14 (Sun) is excluded. Then Mon (15), Tue (16), Wed (17), Thu (18), Fri (19) \u2013 that's 5 business days. Then Sat (20) and Sun (21) are weekends. Then next week starts on Mon (22). So from 22 to 31:\n\nMon (22), Tue (23), Wed (24), Thu (25), Fri (26) \u2013 that's 5 business days. Then Sat (27), Sun (28). Then next week: Mon (29), Tue (30), Wed (31). So that's 3 business days. So total in August: 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 business days?\n\nWait, let me check again. August 14 is Sunday. So the first week (Aug 14-21) includes 5 business days (Mon-Fri) from 15-19, then Sat and Sun. Then the next week (Aug 22-28) has Mon-Fri (22-26), then Sat and Sun. Then the next week (Aug 29-31) has Mon (29), Tue (30), Wed (31). So that's 3 days. So total business days in August: 5 + 5 + 3 = 13. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow moving to September. September has 30 days. The period from August 31 (Wednesday) to October 16 (Sunday). Wait, but the start of September is September 1. Let me check the dates. August 31 is Wednesday. So September 1 is Thursday. So September 1 is a Thursday. Let me count the business days in September.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. But since we need to count from September 1 to September 30, inclusive. Let's check how many business days that is.\n\nSince September 1 is a Thursday, the first week of September would be Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4), Monday (5), Tuesday (6), Wednesday (7). Wait, but that's 7 days. Wait, September 1 is Thursday. So the first week (Sep 1-7) includes 5 business days (Thu-Fri, Mon-Tue, Wed? Wait, no. Wait, Sep 1 is Thursday. So the first week would be:\n\nSep 1 (Thu), 2 (Fri), 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed). So business days are Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed. That's 5 days. Then the next week (Sep 8-14): Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed. Again 5 business days. Then Sep 15-21: same, 5 business days. Then Sep 22-28: 5 business days. Then Sep 29-30: two days, which are Thu (29) and Fri (30). So that's 2 business days. So total in September: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 22 business days? Wait, 5 weeks would be 5*5=25, but since September has 30 days, which is 4 weeks (28 days) plus 2 days. So 4 weeks would be 4*5=20, plus 2 days (Thu and Fri) = 22. Yes, that's correct. So September has 22 business days.\n\nNow October. The period ends on October 16, which is a Sunday. Let's check the dates. October 1 is a Saturday (since September 30 is a Friday, so October 1 is Saturday). Wait, September 30 is a Friday? Wait, September 30 is the last day of September. Let me check. If September 1 is Thursday, then September 30 is 29 days later. 29 days is 4 weeks (28 days) plus 1 day. So September 1 is Thursday, so September 29 is Thursday, September 30 is Friday. Therefore, October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday. The period ends on October 16, which is Sunday. So let's count the business days from October 1 (Saturday) to October 16 (Sunday).\n\nOctober 1 is Saturday, so the first day is a weekend. Let's list the days:\n\nOctober 1 (Sat), 2 (Sun), 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri), 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue), 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri), 15 (Sat), 16 (Sun).\n\nSo from October 1 to October 16 inclusive is 16 days. Now, the business days are Mon-Fri. Let's count them:\n\nOctober 3 (Mon), 4 (Tue), 5 (Wed), 6 (Thu), 7 (Fri) \u2013 that's 5 days.\n\nThen October 10 (Mon), 11 (Tue), 12 (Wed), 13 (Thu), 14 (Fri) \u2013 another 5 days.\n\nThen October 15 is Saturday, 16 is Sunday. So that's 2 days, which are weekends. So total business days in October: 5 + 5 = 10 days.\n\nWait, but the period includes October 16, which is Sunday. So the total days in October from 1 to 16 is 16 days. But the business days are 10. So that's correct.\n\nSo adding up the business days:\n\nAugust: 13\n\nSeptember: 22\n\nOctober: 10\n\nTotal: 13 + 22 = 35, plus 10 is 45. So the total number of business days is 45?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days between the two dates and subtract the weekends. Let's try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of days from August 14 to October 16 inclusive.\n\nAugust 14 to August 31: 18 days (as before).\n\nSeptember has 30 days.\n\nOctober 1 to October 16: 16 days.\n\nTotal days: 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days.\n\nNow, subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period.\n\nBut how many weekends are there?\n\nAlternatively, since the total days are 64, and business days are 64 minus weekends. But how many weekends?\n\nAlternatively, since the start date is Sunday, August 14, and the end date is Sunday, October 16. Let's check how many weeks there are between these dates.\n\nFrom August 14 (Sunday) to October 16 (Sunday) is exactly 64 days. Let's check how many weeks that is. 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. Wait, 9 weeks is 63 days, so 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day. So that would mean there are 9 full weeks and one extra day. But since the start and end are both Sundays, that might be correct.\n\nIn 9 weeks, there are 9 Saturdays and 9 Sundays. Then the extra day is the 64th day, which is Sunday. So total weekends would be 9 Saturdays + 9 Sundays + 1 Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, the first day is Sunday (Aug 14), and the last day is Sunday (Oct 16). So the total number of Sundays is 9 + 1 = 10? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIf there are 9 weeks (63 days) plus 1 day (total 64 days), then the first day is Sunday, so the 63 days would end on Saturday (since 63 days later is 9 weeks, so same day of the week as the start day, which is Sunday, plus 63 days. Wait, no. Wait, if you start on Sunday, adding 7 days is the same day. So 63 days is 9 weeks, so the 63rd day is also a Sunday. Then the 64th day is the next day, which is Monday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, August 14 is Sunday. Let's count the days:\n\nAugust 14 (Sunday) is day 1.\n\nAugust 15 (Monday) is day 2.\n\n...\n\nAugust 21 (Sunday) is day 7.\n\nAugust 22 (Monday) is day 8.\n\n...\n\nSo each week is 7 days. So day 7 is Sunday, day 14 is Sunday, day 21 is Sunday, day 28 is Sunday, day 35 is Sunday, day 42 is Sunday, day 49 is Sunday, day 56 is Sunday, day 63 is Sunday. Then day 64 is Monday. But the end date is October 16, which is Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe my initial calculation of total days is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual dates. Let me check the actual number of days between August 14 and October 16.\n\nAugust has 31 days. So from August 14 to August 31 is 18 days (as before). September has 30 days. October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So total is 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days. But if August 14 is day 1 (Sunday), then day 64 would be 63 days later. Let me check what day of the week that is.\n\nSince 63 days is exactly 9 weeks, so day 63 would be Sunday again. Then day 64 would be Monday. But the end date is October 16, which is Sunday. So that suggests that my calculation of the total days is wrong. Therefore, there's a mistake here. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days in August. Let me check again. August 14 to August 31 inclusive. August 14 is day 1. August 15 is day 2, ..., August 31 is day 18. So that's correct. 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days. Then September is 30 days, October 1-16 is 16 days. So 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days. But according to the day of the week, that would mean that October 16 is a Monday, but according to the original problem, it's a Sunday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have made a mistake in the initial assumption about the day of the week for August 14, 2022.\n\nWait, maybe August 14, 2022 was not a Sunday. Let me check that. Let me recall that August 15, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if August 15 is a Monday, then August 14 is a Sunday. So that's correct. Then August 14 is Sunday, August 15 is Monday, etc. So if August 14 is Sunday, then adding 63 days (9 weeks) would be August 14 + 63 days = October 16? Wait, let me check. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nAugust has 31 days. So from August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. Then September has 30 days, so adding 30 days brings us to October 1. Then October 1 is 18 + 30 = 48 days after August 14. Then October 16 is 16 days after October 1, so total days from August 14 to October 16 is 48 + 16 = 64 days. So if August 14 is Sunday, then 64 days later is October 16. Let's check what day of the week that is.\n\nSince 63 days later is the same day of the week (Sunday), so day 63 is Sunday, day 64 is Monday. But according to the problem, October 16 is Sunday. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which means that my initial assumption that August 14 is Sunday is wrong. Wait, but I thought August 15 was Monday. Let me check that.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual calendar for August 2022. Let me think. For example, August 15, 2022 was a Monday. So August 14 was a Sunday. Then August 15 is Monday. Then August 16 is Tuesday, etc. So that's correct. Then adding 63 days to August 14 would be October 16. But according to the day of the week, that should be Monday. But the problem says that October 16 is Sunday. Therefore, there's a mistake here. Which means that my calculation of the total days is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo? Or maybe I made a mistake in the number of days in the months.\n\nWait, let me check the actual number of days between August 14 and October 16. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nAugust 14 to August 31: 18 days.\n\nSeptember has 30 days.\n\nOctober 1 to October 16: 16 days.\n\nTotal: 18 + 30 + 16 = 64 days. So that's correct. But according to the day of the week, that would mean October 16 is a Monday. But the problem says it's a Sunday. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Which means that either the problem is incorrect, or my understanding of the days is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for August 14.\n\nWait, maybe I should check an online calendar. But since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. For example, I know that August 15, 2022 was a Monday. So August 14 is Sunday. Then August 15 is Monday. Then August 16 is Tuesday, August 17 is Wednesday, August 18 is Thursday, August 19 is Friday, August 20 is Saturday, August 21 is Sunday. Then August 22 is Monday. So that's correct. Then September 1 is a Thursday. Wait, August 21 is Sunday, August 22 is Monday, August 23 is Tuesday, August 24 is Wednesday, August 25 is Thursday, August 26 is Friday, August 27 is Saturday, August 28 is Sunday, August"], [74, "Count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022, and find out what day of the week that falls on. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can divide 70 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that: 70 divided by 7 is 10. So 70 days is exactly 10 weeks. Wait, if that's the case, then subtracting 10 weeks from September 2, 2022, should land me on the same day of the week, right? Because a week is 7 days, so subtracting a multiple of 7 days doesn't change the weekday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me confirm the date. September 2, 2022, is a Friday. If I subtract 7 days, that would be August 26, 2022, which is also a Friday. Then subtract another 7 days, August 19, 2022, also Friday. So every 7 days, the weekday remains the same. Therefore, subtracting 70 days (which is 10 weeks) would still be a Friday. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the dates? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're dealing with September, which is after February, leap years don't affect this. So the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's try that. Starting from September 2, 2022 (Friday), subtract 7 days: August 26, 2022 (Friday). Subtract another 7: August 19 (Friday). Then August 12 (Friday), August 5 (Friday). Then July 29 (Friday). July 22 (Friday). July 15 (Friday). July 8 (Friday). July 1 (Friday). Then June 24 (Friday). Wait, that's 10 weeks, right? Let me count: 7 days each time. So 7 days x 10 = 70 days. So subtracting 70 days would be June 24, 2022? Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dates. Let me check each step again.\n\nWait, September 2 minus 7 days is August 26. Then minus 7 is August 19. Then August 12, August 5. Then July 29, July 22, July 15, July 8, July 1. Then June 24, June 17, June 10, June 3. Wait, that's 10 weeks? Wait, 7 days each time. So from September 2, subtract 7 days 10 times. Let me count the number of steps. Each step is 7 days. So 10 steps would be 70 days. So the 10th step would be June 3, 2022? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try another approach. Let's count the days from September 2, 2022, going backward.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So September 2 minus 7 days is August 26. Then August has 31 days. So August 26 minus 7 days is August 19. Then August 19 minus 7 is August 12. August 12 minus 7 is August 5. August 5 minus 7 is July 29. July 29 minus 7 is July 22. July 22 minus 7 is July 15. July 15 minus 7 is July 8. July 8 minus 7 is July 1. July 1 minus 7 is June 24. June 24 minus 7 is June 17. June 17 minus 7 is June 10. June 10 minus 7 is June 3. So that's 10 steps of 7 days each, totaling 70 days. So the date would be June 3, 2022. Now, what day of the week is June 3, 2022?\n\nWait, but I know that September 2, 2022, is a Friday. If I subtract 70 days, which is 10 weeks, then the day of the week should still be Friday. So June 3, 2022, should also be a Friday. But maybe I should check if that's correct. Let me think. For example, if I take a known date, like June 3, 2022. Let me check if that's a Friday. Wait, I can recall that June 3, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, but how? Let me think. Let's take another approach. Let's check the day of the week for June 3, 2022. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, I need to be careful here. Let me check. Wait, I think January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then, if I can count the days from there, but that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that September 2, 2022, is a Friday. Let's count backward 70 days. Since 70 is a multiple of 7, the day of the week remains the same. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. \n\nBut maybe I should verify with another method. Let's count the number of days from June 3, 2022, to September 2, 2022. Let's see. June has 30 days, so from June 3 to June 30 is 27 days. July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September 2 is 2 days. So total days from June 3 to September 2 is 27 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 2 (September) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 2 is 91 days. Wait, that's 91 days. But that's from June 3 to September 2. But I thought that 70 days backward from September 2 would be June 3. But according to this, June 3 to September 2 is 91 days. That's a problem. So that suggests that my previous calculation was wrong. \n\nWait, so if September 2 is 91 days after June 3, then subtracting 70 days from September 2 would be 91 - 70 = 21 days after June 3. So June 3 + 21 days would be June 24, 2022. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. So where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me recalculate the days between June 3 and September 2. June has 30 days. From June 3 to June 30 is 27 days (inclusive of June 3? No, if you count from June 3 to June 30, that's 30 - 3 = 27 days, but if you include both start and end, it's 28 days. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think. If I want to count the number of days between two dates, inclusive or exclusive? \n\nIf I want to find how many days are between June 3 and September 2, inclusive, then it's (June 3 to June 30) is 28 days (since June 3 is day 1, June 4 is day 2, ..., June 30 is day 28). Then July has 31 days, so adding 31 days. August has 31 days, adding 31. Then September 2 is day 2. So total is 28 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 92 days. But that's if you include both start and end dates. However, if you want the number of days between June 3 and September 2, not including the end date, it's 91 days. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use another approach. Let's use the fact that 70 days is 10 weeks. So if September 2 is a Friday, then subtracting 70 days (10 weeks) should be the same day of the week. Therefore, the answer is Friday. But why did my previous calculation of the dates give me a discrepancy? Because I must have made a mistake in counting the days between June 3 and September 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different method. Let's use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's count backward 70 days from September 2, 2022. \n\nStarting from September 2, subtract 7 days: August 26 (Friday). Subtract another 7: August 19 (Friday). Subtract 7: August 12 (Friday). Subtract 7: August 5 (Friday). Subtract 7: July 29 (Friday). Subtract 7: July 22 (Friday). Subtract 7: July 15 (Friday). Subtract 7: July 8 (Friday). Subtract 7: July 1 (Friday). Subtract 7: June 24 (Friday). Subtract 7: June 17 (Friday). Subtract 7: June 10 (Friday). Subtract 7: June 3 (Friday). That's 10 steps of 7 days each, totaling 70 days. So June 3, 2022, is the date. \n\nBut earlier when I tried to count the days between June 3 and September 2, I got 91 days. That suggests that June 3 is 91 days before September 2. But that can't be right because 70 days before September 2 would be June 3, but 91 days is more than 70. So there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, maybe I'm counting the days incorrectly. Let me try again. Let's count the days from June 3 to September 2. \n\nJune has 30 days. From June 3 to June 30 is 28 days (since June 3 is day 1, June 4 is day 2, ..., June 30 is day 28). Then July has 31 days, so adding 31 days. August has 31 days, adding 31 days. Then September 2 is 2 days. So total is 28 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 92 days. But that's if you include both June 3 and September 2. So the number of days between June 3 and September 2 is 91 days if you don't include the end date. So if June 3 is 91 days before September 2, then subtracting 70 days from September 2 would be 91 - 70 = 21 days after June 3. So June 3 + 21 days is June 24. But according to my previous step-by-step subtraction, June 3 is 70 days before September 2. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nThis suggests that my initial step-by-step subtraction was wrong. Where is the error? Let me check again. \n\nStarting from September 2, subtract 7 days: August 26 (1st week). Subtract 7: August 19 (2nd). Subtract 7: August 12 (3rd). Subtract 7: August 5 (4th). Subtract 7: July 29 (5th). Subtract 7: July 22 (6th). Subtract 7: July 15 (7th). Subtract 7: July 8 (8th). Subtract 7: July 1 (9th). Subtract 7: June 24 (10th). So that's 10 steps, 70 days. So June 24 is 70 days before September 2. But according to the other calculation, June 3 is 91 days before September 2. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh, I think I see the problem. When I counted the days between June 3 and September 2, I included both dates, but when I subtract 70 days from September 2, I'm not including the end date. So the correct way is to count the number of days from June 24 to September 2. Let's check that. \n\nJune 24 to June 30: 7 days (June 24 is day 1, June 25 day 2, ..., June 30 day 7). July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September 2 is 2 days. So total is 7 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 71 days. Wait, that's 71 days from June 24 to September 2. But that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's use the fact that if September 2 is a Friday, then June 24 is also a Friday. But according to the other calculation, June 3 is 91 days before September 2, which would be 91 days before. But 91 divided by 7 is 13 weeks, so that would be the same day of the week. So June 3 would also be a Friday. But that contradicts the step-by-step subtraction. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to check an actual calendar. But since I can't do that, I need to find another way. Let me think. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022, was a Friday. Let's check that. If July 1 is a Friday, then July 8 is also a Friday, and so on. So July 1 is Friday. Then June 24 would be 7 days before July 1, which is also a Friday. So June 24 is a Friday. Then June 17 is also a Friday, and so on. So June 3 would be 14 days before June 17, which is also a Friday. Wait, 14 days is two weeks, so June 3 would be a Friday. But according to the previous calculation, June 3 is 91 days before September 2, which is 13 weeks, so same day. So both June 3 and June 24 are Fridays. But that can't be, because they are 21 days apart. Wait, that's impossible. \n\nWait, this suggests that there's a mistake in my step-by-step subtraction. Because if June 24 is a Friday, then June 3 would be 21 days before June 24, which is 3 weeks, so also a Friday. But according to the previous step-by-step, subtracting 70 days from September 2 lands on June 24, which is a Friday. But if June 3 is also a Friday, then that would mean that there are two different dates that are both Fridays, which is possible if they are 7 days apart. But 70 days is 10 weeks, so subtracting 70 days should land on the same day. So why is there a discrepancy in the date calculation?\n\nI think the error is in the way I counted the days between June 3 and September 2. Let me try again. Let's count the days from June 3 to September 2. \n\nJune has 30 days. From June 3 to June 30 is 28 days (since June 3 is day 1, June 4 is day 2, ..., June 30 is day 28). Then July has 31 days, so adding 31 days. August has 31 days, adding 31 days. Then September 2 is 2 days. So total is 28 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 92 days. But that's if you include both June 3 and September 2. So the number of days between June 3 and September 2 is 91 days if you don't include the end date. So if June 3 is 91 days before September 2, then subtracting 70 days from September 2 would be 91 - 70 = 21 days after June 3. So June 3 + 21 days is June 24. But according to the step-by-step subtraction, June 24 is 70 days before September 2. So that would mean that June 24 is 70 days before September 2, and June 3 is 91 days before September 2. That's possible because 70 days is 10 weeks, and 91 days is 13 weeks. So both dates are Fridays. \n\nBut that would mean that June 3 is 21 days after June 24, which is correct. So both are Fridays. Therefore, the answer is Friday. \n\nSo regardless of the date, since 70 days is a multiple of 7, the weekday remains the same. Therefore, the answer is Friday.", "Friday"], [74, "In a year where Saturday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 27. Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find out what day of the week March 27 falls on, given that January 1st is a Saturday. Hmm, I need to figure out the number of days between January 1st and March 27th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, let's break down the months. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify a leap year. Hmm, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year unless stated otherwise. So February has 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to March 27th would be: 31 (January) - 1 (since we start on January 1st) + 28 (February) + 27 (March). Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March, so total days from January 1st is 58 + 27 = 85 days. Wait, but wait, maybe I should count the days between January 1st and March 27th inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, the problem says \"in a year where Saturday is January 1st\", so January 1st is Saturday. So if I count the number of days from January 1st to March 27th, inclusive, then the number of days would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 27 (Mar) - 1 (since January 1st is included once). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of days from January 1st to March 27th, and then take that number modulo 7 to find the day of the week. Since each week has 7 days, the remainder will tell me how many days ahead March 27th is from January 1st.\n\nSo January 1st is day 0 (Saturday). Then January 2nd is day 1 (Sunday), and so on. So the day of the week for any date can be found by (number of days since Jan 1) mod 7. If the remainder is 0, it's Saturday; 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, etc.\n\nSo let's calculate the total days from January 1st to March 27th. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since Jan 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March, so total days from Jan 1 is 58 + 27 = 85 days. Wait, but that would be 85 days after January 1st. Wait, but if January 1 is day 0, then day 1 is Jan 2, day 2 is Jan 3, etc. So March 27th is 85 days after January 1st. So 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 1 day. Because 7*12=84, so 85-84=1. So that would mean March 27th is 1 day after Saturday, which is Sunday. Wait, but that seems too easy. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since Jan 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 27 is 27 days. So total days from Jan 1 to March 27 is 30 + 28 + 27 = 85 days. So 85 days after Jan 1. Now, 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (84 days) and 1 day. So 85 days later is 1 day after Saturday. So Saturday + 1 day is Sunday. Therefore, March 27th is a Sunday. But wait, I need to make sure that the calculation is correct. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. January 1 is Saturday. Let's count the days for each month. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday again, and so on. Let's see, January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Saturday. Then February 12, 19, 26. Then March 5 is Saturday. Then March 12, 19, 26. So March 26 is Saturday. Then March 27 is Sunday. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, March 27 is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday.", "Sunday"], [74, "On which weekday did October 8, 2022 fall? Provide the full name of the weekday.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 8, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, let me check that. If I remember correctly, 2022 started on a Sunday. Let me confirm that. \n\nWait, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because January 1, 2021 was a Friday? Wait, no, I need to be careful here. Maybe I should use a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 8, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about known dates. For example, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, if that's the case, then adding days to get to October 8. Let me count. October 1 is Saturday. Then October 2 is Sunday, October 3 is Monday, October 4 is Tuesday, October 5 is Wednesday, October 6 is Thursday, October 7 is Friday, and October 8 would be Saturday. Wait, but that would make October 8 a Saturday. But I'm not sure if October 1, 2022 was actually a Saturday. Maybe I should check that again. \n\nAlternatively, I can use an online calendar or a perpetual calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think about another way. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday, then adding days to get to October 8. Let's see: July has 31 days, so July 4 is Monday. July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday, August 1 is Monday. August has 31 days, so August 1 is Monday, August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. Then September 5 is Monday, September 12 is Monday, September 19 is Monday, September 26 is Monday. October 3 is Monday. Then October 4 is Tuesday, October 5 is Wednesday, October 6 is Thursday, October 7 is Friday, October 8 is Saturday. So that would make October 8, 2022 a Saturday. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me think. I remember that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2022 would be one day later, so July 4, 2022 would be a Tuesday? Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here. Let me try again. \n\nWait, 2021 started on a Monday. So January 1, 2021 was a Friday? Wait, no. Wait, 2020 started on a Wednesday. So 2021 started on a Thursday? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall the correct days. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 8, 2022 is the same as the date in 2023, but that might not help. Alternatively, I can use the fact that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. If that's correct, then October 8 would be Saturday + 7 days, which is the same day. Wait, but that would mean October 8 is Saturday. But if October 1 is Saturday, then October 8 is the next Saturday. So that would be correct. \n\nBut how do I confirm that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday? Let me think. If I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then that's the key. Alternatively, I can use the fact that November 4, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, but that might not help. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If December 21 is Wednesday, then December 22 is Thursday, December 23 is Friday, December 24 is Saturday, December 25 is Sunday, December 26 is Monday, December 27 is Tuesday, December 28 is Wednesday, December 29 is Thursday, December 30 is Friday, December 31 is Saturday. Then January 1, 2023 is Sunday. Wait, but that would mean that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. If that's correct, then let's count back. Let's see, December 21 is Wednesday. Then November 21 is also a Wednesday. Then October 21 is Wednesday. Then October 21 is Wednesday. Then October 1 is 20 days before October 21. Let's count: October 1 is 20 days before October 21. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So if October 21 is Wednesday, then October 1 would be Wednesday minus 6 days. Wednesday minus 6 days is Saturday. So October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Therefore, October 8 would be Saturday + 7 days, which is Saturday again. So October 8, 2022 is a Saturday. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Saturday. But I need to make sure that my calculation is correct. Let me check again. If October 1 is Saturday, then October 8 is the next Saturday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Tuesday, February 1 to Wednesday, April 20, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between February 1, 2022 (Tuesday) and April 20, 2022 (Wednesday), inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. February 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think February 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can use a calendar or calculate it. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So January has 31 days. So February 1 is 31 days later. 31 days later would be 31 days from Saturday, January 1. Let's see: 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday would be Tuesday. So yes, February 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. That's correct.\n\nNow, April 20, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let me confirm that. Let's see, March has 31 days, so February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year). So from February 1 to March 1 is 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so April 1 is 31 + 28 = 59 days after February 1? Wait, no. Wait, February 1 is day 0. Then February has 28 days, so March 1 is day 28. Then March has 31 days, so April 1 is day 28 + 31 = 59. Then April 20 is 59 + 19 = 78 days after February 1. Wait, but that's the total days. But maybe I need to check the actual day of the week for April 20. Alternatively, maybe I can use a date calculator or a known reference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just list the dates and count the weekdays. But that might take too long. Alternatively, I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the number of weekends.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days from February 1 to April 20, inclusive. Let's calculate the days step by step.\n\nFebruary 1 to February 28: 28 days. But since February 1 is included, and we need to include April 20, let's break it down:\n\nFrom February 1 to February 28: 28 days (since February 1 is the start date, and February 28 is the end of February). Then March has 31 days, and April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days would be 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 20 (Apr) = 28 + 31 is 59, plus 20 is 79 days. Wait, but that's from February 1 to April 20 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if you include both start and end dates, then from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days (since February 1 is day 1, and February 28 is day 28). Then March has 31 days, so adding March 1 to March 31 is 31 days. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days would be 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. But wait, that's 28 days in February (including February 1), 31 in March, and 20 in April. So total 79 days. But wait, if you include both start and end dates, then that's correct. So total days between February 1 and April 20 inclusive is 79 days.\n\nNow, out of these 79 days, how many are weekends? Let's find the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nSince February 1 is a Tuesday, let's figure out the days of the week for each month.\n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. So February 2 is Wednesday, February 3 is Thursday, February 4 is Friday, February 5 is Saturday, February 6 is Sunday. Then February 7 is Monday, and so on.\n\nSo in February, the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) would be:\n\nFebruary 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun). Wait, February has 28 days. Let me check:\n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. So the first weekend is February 5 (Sat) and 6 (Sun). Then next weekend is 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), then 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), then 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Wait, February 28 is a Thursday. So in February, there are 6 Saturdays (5, 12, 19, 26) and 6 Sundays (6, 13, 20, 27). Wait, but February 28 is a Thursday. So the last weekend in February would be February 26 (Sat) and 27 (Sun). So that's 6 Saturdays and 6 Sundays in February. Wait, that's 12 weekend days in February. But February has 28 days. So 28 days minus 12 weekend days is 16 weekdays. But wait, that's not correct. Wait, 28 days in February. If there are 6 Saturdays and 6 Sundays, that's 12 weekend days. So 28 - 12 = 16 weekdays. But let's check: February 1 is Tuesday. So the first week has 5 days (Tuesday to Saturday), then the next week starts on Sunday. Wait, maybe I should count the number of weekends in February.\n\nAlternatively, since February 1 is Tuesday, the first Saturday is February 5, then each week adds 7 days. So the Saturdays are 5, 12, 19, 26. That's four Saturdays. Then the Sundays would be 6, 13, 20, 27. That's four Sundays. So total of 8 weekend days in February. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous count. Wait, February 28 is a Thursday. So February 26 is Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday. So that's four Saturdays (5, 12, 19, 26) and four Sundays (6, 13, 20, 27). So 8 weekend days in February. Therefore, 28 - 8 = 20 weekdays in February. But that seems high. Wait, if February 1 is Tuesday, then the first week (February 1-7) has Tuesday to Sunday. So that's 7 days. Then the next week (8-14) is Monday to Sunday. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, February 1 is Tuesday. So February 1 is Tuesday, 2 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday. So the first week (1-7) has 7 days. Then the next week (8-14) is Tuesday to Sunday. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, February 8 is Tuesday again. So the first week (1-7) has Tuesday to Sunday. Then the next week (8-14) is Tuesday to Sunday again. So in February, there are 4 weeks and 4 days. Wait, 28 days is exactly 4 weeks. So each week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). So 4 weeks would have 8 weekend days. So that's correct. So 8 weekend days in February. Therefore, 28 - 8 = 20 weekdays in February. But that seems like a lot. Wait, 20 weekdays in February? Let me check. If February 1 is Tuesday, then the first week (1-7) has 5 weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and 2 weekends (Saturday and Sunday). Then the next week (8-14) has 5 weekdays (Tuesday to Friday) and 2 weekends. So each week has 5 weekdays. 4 weeks would be 20 weekdays. So that's correct. So February has 20 weekdays.\n\nNow March. March 1, 2022 is a Monday. Because February 28 is a Thursday, so March 1 is Friday? Wait, wait. Wait, February 28 is a Thursday. Then March 1 is Friday. Wait, but earlier I thought that February 28 is a Thursday. Wait, let me check again. February 1 is Tuesday. February 28 is 27 days later. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Tuesday: Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf February 1 is Tuesday, then February 1 + 7 days is February 8, which is also Tuesday. Then February 15 is Tuesday, February 22 is Tuesday, and February 28 is Tuesday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday. Then February 8 is Tuesday again. So February 15 is Tuesday, 22 is Tuesday, 29 is Tuesday. But 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So February 28 is 27 days after February 1. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Tuesday: Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. Which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual day of the week for February 28, 2022. Let me think. If February 1 is Tuesday, then February 1 + 6 days is February 7, which is Monday. Then February 8 is Tuesday. So February 28 is 27 days after February 1. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 6 days. So 21 days later is February 28 (since 21 days after February 1 is February 22, which is Tuesday. Then adding 6 days: February 22 (Tue) + 1 day is Wed (23), Thu (24), Fri (25), Sat (26), Sun (27), Mon (28). So February 28 is a Monday. Therefore, March 1 is Tuesday. Wait, that's different from my previous thought. So March 1 is Tuesday. So March 1 is Tuesday. Then March has 31 days. So March 1 is Tuesday, March 2 is Wednesday, March 3 is Thursday, March 4 is Friday, March 5 is Saturday, March 6 is Sunday. So the weekends in March are Saturday and Sunday. So in March, the first weekend is March 5 (Sat) and 6 (Sun). Then each week after that. So how many weekends are in March?\n\nMarch has 31 days. Let's calculate the number of weekends. Since March 1 is Tuesday, the first weekend is March 5 (Sat) and 6 (Sun). Then the next weekend is March 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), then 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). Then March 31 is a Friday. So that's 6 weekends in March: 5,6; 12,13; 19,20; 26,27. That's 6 weekend days. So 6 weekend days in March. Therefore, 31 - 6 = 25 weekdays in March.\n\nNow April. April 1, 2022 is a Friday. Because March 31 is a Friday. Wait, March 1 is Tuesday. March has 31 days. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So March 1 is Tuesday, March 29 is Tuesday, March 30 is Wednesday, March 31 is Thursday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. Wait, March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 8 is Tuesday, 15 is Tuesday, 22 is Tuesday, 29 is Tuesday. Then March 30 is Wednesday, March 31 is Thursday. So April 1 is Friday. So April 1 is Friday. Then April 2 is Saturday, April 3 is Sunday. So the weekends in April are Saturday and Sunday. The end date is April 20, which is a Wednesday. Let's check that. April 1 is Friday. So April 1 is Friday, 2 Saturday, 3 Sunday, 4 Monday, 5 Tuesday, 6 Wednesday, 7 Thursday, 8 Friday, etc. So April 20 is 19 days after April 1. 19 days is 2 weeks and 5 days. So April 1 (Fri) + 5 days is April 6 (Wed). Wait, that's not right. Wait, April 1 is Friday. April 2 is Saturday, 3 Sunday, 4 Monday, 5 Tuesday, 6 Wednesday, 7 Thursday, 8 Friday, 9 Saturday, 10 Sunday, 11 Monday, 12 Tuesday, 13 Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday, 19 Tuesday, 20 Wednesday. So April 20 is a Wednesday. Correct. So April 20 is Wednesday.\n\nNow, in April, the weekends are Saturday and Sunday. Let's count the number of weekends from April 1 to April 20 inclusive. April 1 is Friday. So the first weekend is April 2 (Sat) and 3 (Sun). Then next weekend is 9 (Sat), 10 (Sun). Then 16 (Sat), 17 (Sun). Then 23 (Sat), 24 (Sun). But April 20 is the end date, so we need to check up to April 20. So the weekends in April are April 2,3; 9,10; 16,17. That's 3 weekends (6 days). So 3 weekend days in April. Therefore, the number of weekdays in April is 20 days (from April 1 to April 20 inclusive) minus 3 weekend days = 17 weekdays.\n\nWait, but April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. Let me check: April 1 is day 1, April 20 is day 20. So 20 days. So 20 - 3 = 17 weekdays in April.\n\nSo total weekdays would be:\n\nFebruary: 20 weekdays\n\nMarch: 25 weekdays\n\nApril: 17 weekdays\n\nTotal: 20 + 25 + 17 = 62 weekdays.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because the total days between February 1 and April 20 inclusive is 79 days. If there are 62 weekdays, then the number of weekends would be 79 - 62 = 17. But earlier I calculated 8 (February) + 6 (March) + 3 (April) = 17. That matches. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 62.", "62"], [74, "Name the day of the week for 05/21/2022. Give the weekday name in full.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week May 21, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 is a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards to find May 21.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's see. May has 31 days. So May 21 is 21 days into May. But how does that help me? Well, if I can find the day of the week for a known date in May 2022, then I can count forward or backward.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a reference date that I know. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think. If July 4 is a Monday, then let's count backwards. July 4 is Monday. Let's go back to June 1. June has 30 days, so June 1 is 3 days before July 4. Wait, July 4 minus 30 days is June 4. Wait, maybe I need to count the days between dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me check. Wait, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm. For example, if I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday.\n\nNow, let's count the days from January 1 to May 21. Let's break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year). March has 31 days, April has 30 days, and May 21 is the 21st day of May.\n\nSo total days from January 1 to May 21 would be:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 21 days\n\nAdding those up: 31 + 28 = 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 21 is 141 days. So 141 days from January 1, 2022.\n\nNow, since January 1 is a Saturday, adding 141 days to that date will give me the day of the week. But how do I calculate that? Well, each week has 7 days, so 141 divided by 7 gives the number of weeks and the remainder gives the number of days ahead.\n\n141 divided by 7 is 20 weeks (140 days) with a remainder of 1 day. So 141 days later is 20 weeks and 1 day. Therefore, if January 1 is a Saturday, adding 1 day would make it a Sunday. Wait, but that would mean May 21 is a Sunday? But I need to check if my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. If January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is also Saturday, and so on. So adding 7 days each week. So 141 days is 20 weeks (140 days) plus 1 day. So 140 days later is the same day, Saturday, and then 1 more day is Sunday. So May 21 would be a Sunday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the total days.\n\nWait, let me recount the days from January 1 to May 21. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February is 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90 days. April has 30 days, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120 days. Then May 21 is 21 days into May, so total days from January 1 to May 21 is 120 + 21 = 141 days. That's correct.\n\nSo 141 days from January 1, 2022. Since 141 divided by 7 is 20 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Saturday would be Sunday. Therefore, May 21, 2022 is a Sunday. But wait, I think I might be wrong here. Because sometimes when you count days, you have to be careful whether you include the starting day or not. For example, if January 1 is day 0, then adding 1 day would be day 1. But if you count from January 1 as day 1, then adding 141 days would be day 141. But in terms of the day of the week, if January 1 is Saturday, then day 1 is Saturday, day 8 is Saturday, etc. So day 141 would be 141 - 1 = 140 days after January 1. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the number of days after January 1. So if January 1 is day 0, then day 1 is January 2. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I should use modular arithmetic. The day of the week can be calculated by (starting day + number of days) mod 7. Since January 1 is Saturday, which is day 6 if we consider Sunday as 0. Wait, maybe I need to assign numbers to days. Let me think.\n\nLet me assign numbers to days of the week, where Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, ..., Saturday is 6. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, that would be 6. Then adding 141 days, the day of the week would be (6 + 141) mod 7. Let's calculate 141 divided by 7. 7*20=140, so 141 is 140 +1, so 141 mod 7 is 1. So (6 + 1) mod 7 = 7 mod 7 = 0. So 0 corresponds to Sunday. Therefore, May 21, 2022 is a Sunday. \n\nBut I need to check if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 21 would be 20 days later. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. Wait, that contradicts the previous result. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that May 1, 2022 is a Sunday is wrong. Let me check. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then let's count the days to May 1. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February 28 days, March 31, April 30, and May 1 is 1 day. So total days from January 1 to May 1 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 121 days. Wait, no. Wait, from January 1 to May 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 1 (May 1) = 31+28=59, +31=90, +30=120, +1=121. So 121 days from January 1. So 121 days later. 121 divided by 7 is 17 weeks (119 days) and 2 days. So 121 mod 7 is 2. So if January 1 is Saturday (6), then adding 2 days would be 6 + 2 = 8 mod 7 = 1. Which is Monday. So that would mean May 1, 2022 is a Monday. But that contradicts the previous thought that May 1 was Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Let me check that. If I look up a calendar for 2022, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. For example, I can check online, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my knowledge. Alternatively, I can use another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's count from July 4 to May 21. Let's see. July 4 is Monday. Let's count backwards to May 21. July has 31 days, so July 4 is Monday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is 30 days before July 4. Let's count the days from June 30 to July 4: June 30 is 30 days before July 4. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the days between May 21 and July 4. May 21 to May 31 is 10 days. June has 30 days, so May 21 to July 4 is 10 + 30 + 4 = 44 days. So 44 days from May 21 to July 4. If July 4 is Monday, then May 21 is 44 days before that. 44 divided by 7 is 6 weeks (42 days) and 2 days. So 44 days before Monday would be 2 days before Monday, which is Saturday. So May 21 would be a Saturday. But this contradicts the previous calculation where I thought it was Sunday or Monday. So now I'm really confused. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the days between May 21 and July 4. Let me check again. May 21 to May 31 is 10 days (since 31-21=10). Then June has 30 days, so from May 21 to June 30 is 10 + 30 = 40 days. Then July 1 to July 4 is 4 days. So total is 40 + 4 = 44 days. So that's correct. So 44 days from May 21 to July 4. If July 4 is Monday, then May 21 is 44 days before. 44 divided by 7 is 6 weeks (42 days) and 2 days. So 44 days before Monday is 2 days before Monday, which is Saturday. So May 21 is a Saturday. But earlier calculations suggested Sunday or Monday. So which is correct?\n\nThis is conflicting. Let me try another approach. Let's use the fact that if May 21 is Saturday, then May 1 is 20 days before that. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So May 1 would be Saturday minus 6 days, which is Sunday. Wait, because if May 21 is Saturday, then May 1 is 20 days earlier. 20 days is 2 weeks (14 days) and 6 days. So subtracting 14 days from May 21 is May 7, which is Saturday. Then subtracting another 6 days: May 7 minus 6 days is May 1. So May 1 would be Sunday. So that would mean May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday, and so on. So May 21 is 20 days after May 1. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. So that's consistent. So May 21 is Saturday. But earlier when I calculated using January 1 as Saturday, I got Sunday. So where is the mistake there?\n\nLet me go back to the first calculation. January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then the total days from January 1 to May 21 is 141 days. 141 divided by 7 is 20 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Saturday would be Sunday. But according to the other method, it's Saturday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the calculation of the number of days between January 1 and May 21. Let me recount that. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. February has 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. March has 31 days, so up to March 31 is 59 + 31 = 90 days. April has 30 days, so up to April 30 is 90 + 30 = 120 days. Then May 21 is 21 days into May. So total days from January 1 to May 21 is 120 + 21 = 141 days. That seems correct. So 141 days from January 1. If January 1 is Saturday, then 141 days later is (Saturday + 141 days). Since 141 mod 7 is 1, that would be Sunday. But according to the other method, it's Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Let me check that again. If I know that May 21 is Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 1 is Sunday. Let's count from May 1 to January 1. That's a lot of days. Alternatively, maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If April 1 is Friday, then May 1 is 31 days later. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Friday + 3 days is Monday. So May 1 would be Monday. But earlier calculation said May 1 is Sunday. So that's conflicting. So now I'm really confused. \n\nWait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 1 + 31 days is May 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Friday + 3 days is Monday. So May 1 is Monday. Then May 21 is 20 days later. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. So May 21 would be Sunday. But earlier calculation using the July 4 method said May 21 is Saturday. So now I'm getting different results. \n\nThis is very confusing. I think I need to find a way to resolve this. Let me try to find a reliable method. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If I can find a source or a way to confirm. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on a Saturday. So that's correct. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. \n\nNow, if May 1, 2022 is a Monday, then May 21 is 20 days later. 20 days is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. So May 21 is Sunday. But earlier calculation using the July 4 method said May 21 is Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if July 4 is Monday, then May 21 is 44 days before. 44 days is 6 weeks and 2 days. So 44 days before Monday is 2 days before Monday, which is Saturday. But if May 21 is Sunday, then 44 days later would be Sunday + 44 days. 44 days is 6 weeks and 2 days. So Sunday + 2 days is Tuesday. But July 4 is Monday, so that's a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in one of the methods. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that July 4 is Monday. Let me check that. If May 21 is Sunday, then May 21 + 44 days is July 4. 44 days"], [74, "Determine if the year 2028 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2028 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2028 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2028 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2028 minus 2000 is 28. 28 divided by 4 is 7. So 500 + 7 is 507. That means 2028 divided by 4 is 507 with no remainder. So that's good, it's divisible by 4.\n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 2028 divided by 100 is 20.28, which isn't a whole number. So it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition (divisible by 400) doesn't apply here. \n\nSince it's divisible by 4 and not a century year, according to the rules, 2028 should be a leap year. Let me just confirm that I didn't mix up any rules. The key points are: divisible by 4, not a century year unless also divisible by 400. Yep, that seems right.

First, I should check what day of the week those dates fall on.\n\nWait, the start date is August 14, 2022. Let me recall or figure out what day that was. I know that August 14, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, but the question says to count Mondays from Sunday, August 14 to Monday, August 15. Wait, so the start date is Sunday, August 14, and the end date is Monday, August 15. So the period includes both days.\n\nSo the dates are August 14 (Sunday) and August 15 (Monday). So the range is two days. Now, how many Mondays are in there? Well, August 14 is a Sunday, so the next day, August 15, is a Monday. So that's one Monday. But wait, the start date is Sunday, so does that include the start date? The problem says to include both start and end dates. So the dates are August 14 (Sunday) and August 15 (Monday). So the Mondays in this range would be August 15. So that's one occurrence. Therefore, the answer should be 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the days. Let me confirm the actual days. Let me think. For example, if I check a calendar, August 14, 2022, was indeed a Sunday. Then August 15 was a Monday. So the period from August 14 to August 15 includes two days: Sunday and Monday. So only one Monday. Therefore, the answer is 1.", "1"], [74, "On which weekday did August 27, 2022 fall?

Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count forward or backward from there.\n\nSo, July 4 is Monday. Let's count the days from July 4 to August 27. July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August 27 is 27 days after July 31. Wait, no. Wait, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days, but adding those days would take me to July 31. Then August 27 is 27 days after July 4? Wait, no. Let me think again. If July 4 is Monday, then July 5 is Tuesday, and so on. Let me calculate the number of days between July 4 and August 27.\n\nJuly has 31 days. So from July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August 27 is 27 days after July 4. Wait, no. Wait, July 4 plus 27 days is July 31. Then August 27 is 27 days after July 31? Wait, no. Wait, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days, so adding 27 days to July 4 would be July 31. Then August 27 is 27 days after July 31? Wait, that would be August 27. Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is 27 days after July 4. Then August 27 is 27 days after July 31? That would be August 27. Wait, but that's 27 days. Wait, but July 31 plus 27 days is August 27? Let me check. July has 31 days, so July 31 plus 1 day is August 1. So adding 27 days to July 31 would be August 27. So total days from July 4 to August 27 is 27 (July) + 27 (August) = 54 days. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days, then August 27 is 27 days after July 31. So total days between July 4 and August 27 is 27 + 27 = 54 days. But 54 days is 7 weeks and 5 days. So if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 54 days would be 7 weeks and 5 days. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. Wait, but that would mean August 27 is a Saturday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another reference date. For example, I know that August 15, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday, August 1 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday, so August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, and August 29 is Monday. So August 27 would be two days before Monday, which is Saturday. So that would mean August 27, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I remember that August 26, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then August 27 would be a Saturday. But I need to verify if August 26 was indeed a Friday. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a perpetual calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me think. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then let's count back. July 4 is Monday. July 1 is a Friday. Then June 30 is a Thursday. June 30 is Thursday. Then June 1 is a Thursday minus 29 days. Wait, that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 2022 is not a leap year. So February had 28 days. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then August 27 is 54 days later. 54 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Monday would be Saturday. Therefore, August 27, 2022 was a Saturday. \n\nBut I need to make sure that July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me check that. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Then July 4 is 3 days later, which would be Monday. Yes, that's correct. So July 4 is Monday. Therefore, adding 54 days to July 4 would be August 27, which is 54 days later. 54 divided by 7 is 7*7=49, 54-49=5. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday.

From January 1st to January 21st is 20 days later, right? Because if January 1st is day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, and so on. So 21 minus 1 is 20 days. Wait, but when calculating the day of the week, do I need to consider that each week has 7 days? So if I divide 20 by 7, the remainder will tell me how many days ahead the 21st is from Sunday.\n\nLet me do the division. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks with a remainder of 6 days. Because 7 times 2 is 14, and 20 minus 14 is 6. So that means 20 days later is 6 days after Sunday. Let me count those days. Sunday is day 0, then Monday (1), Tuesday (2), Wednesday (3), Thursday (4), Friday (5), Saturday (6). So adding 6 days to Sunday would land on Saturday. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is Sunday, then adding 7 days would be the next Sunday, so January 8th is Sunday. Then January 15th is also a Sunday.

Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2015. First, check if 2015 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2015 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2015 minus 2000 is 15. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75. So 2015 divided by 4 is 503.75, which is not a whole number. That means 2015 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the rules, it can't be a leap year. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me add 4 to 2015 to see the next possible leap year. 2015 + 4 is 2019, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can check if 2015 is a century year. Century years are years ending with 00, like 2000, 1900, etc. 2015 ends with 15, so it's not a century year. Therefore, even if it were divisible by 4, which it isn't, it would still need to be a century year to check the 400 rule.

Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. Then May 31 is two days after May 29, which would be Tuesday. So May 31 is Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. So June 26 would be 25 days later. Let's count. June 1 is Wednesday. June 8 is Wednesday, June 15 is Wednesday, June 22 is Wednesday, June 29 is Wednesday. So June 26 is three days before June 29, which is Wednesday minus 3 days, which is Sunday. So June 26 is Sunday. \n\nBut then July 4 would be 7 days after June 26, which is Sunday + 7 days = Sunday. But I thought July 4 was a Monday. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about July 4. Let me check. If June 26 is Sunday, then July 1 is Thursday. July 1 is Thursday, July 8 is Thursday, July 15 is Thursday, July 22 is Thursday, July 29 is Thursday. So July 4 would be 3 days after June 26 (June 26 is Sunday, June 27 is Monday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 29 is Wednesday, July 1 is Thursday. Wait, that's not right. Wait, June 26 is Sunday. June 27 is Monday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 29 is Wednesday, July 1 is Thursday. So July 4 is 3 days after July 1, which is Thursday + 3 days = Sunday. So July 4 would be Sunday. But I thought it was Monday. Maybe I was wrong before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, July 1, 2022 was a Thursday. If that's the case, then July 4 is Sunday. So that would align with the previous calculation. So June 26 is Sunday. Therefore, the answer would be Sunday. \n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me think again. If June 26 is Sunday, then June 27 is Monday, June 28 is Tuesday, June 29 is Wednesday, July 1 is Thursday. Then July 4 is Sunday. That seems correct. So that would mean June 26 is Sunday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's use Zeller's Congruence. The formula for Zeller's Congruence for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for June 26, 2022, m is 6, and the year is 2022. So q is 26, m is 6, K is 22, J is 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (26 + floor((13*(6 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nfloor((13*7)/5) = floor(91/5) = floor(18.2) = 18\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n26 + 18 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 26 + 18 is 44, plus 22 is 66, plus 5 is 71, plus 5 is 76, plus 100 is 176.\n\nNow 176 mod 7. Let's divide 176 by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 176 mod 7 is 1. \n\nSo h = 1. According to Zeller's Congruence, h=1 corresponds to Sunday. Therefore, June 26, 2022 was a Sunday.", "Sunday"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, July 31 to Sunday, October 2, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Give the count numerically.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between July 31, 2022 (Sunday) and October 2, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. July 31 is a Sunday. Then August 1 is a Monday. Let me list out the days for each month.\n\nJuly 31 is Sunday. August has 31 days. So August 1 is Monday, August 2 is Tuesday, etc. Then September has 30 days, and October 1 is a Sunday (since October 2 is a Sunday, so October 1 is Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, if October 2 is Sunday, then October 1 is Saturday. Wait, but the end date is October 2, which is Sunday. So let me confirm the days of the week for each date.\n\nWait, July 31, 2022 is a Sunday. Then August 1 is Monday. Let me check the days for each month.\n\nJuly 31 (Sunday), August 1 (Monday), August 2 (Tuesday), August 3 (Wednesday), August 4 (Thursday), August 5 (Friday), August 6 (Saturday), August 7 (Sunday), and so on.\n\nSo in August, the weekends would be the 6th, 7th, 13th, 14th, 20th, 21st, 27th, 28th. Wait, but August has 31 days. Let me count the number of weekends in August.\n\nFrom August 1 (Monday) to August 31 (Wednesday). Wait, August 31 is a Wednesday? Wait, let me check. Let's see, July 31 is Sunday. August 1 is Monday. August 7 is Sunday. Then August 14 is Sunday, August 21 is Sunday, August 28 is Sunday, and September 4 is Sunday. So August 31 is a Wednesday. So August has 31 days. Let me count the number of weekends in August.\n\nWeekends in August are Saturdays and Sundays. So Sundays in August are 1st (no, August 1 is Monday. Wait, August 7 is Sunday. Then August 14, 21, 28. So that's four Sundays in August. Then Saturdays would be August 6, 13, 20, 27. So four Saturdays. So total weekends in August are 4 + 4 = 8 days. So the number of weekdays in August would be 31 - 8 = 23 days. Wait, but wait, 31 days total. 8 weekends, so 23 weekdays. But let me check that again. Wait, August 1 is Monday, so the first week has 7 days (Mon to Sun). Then the next weeks. Let me count the number of weekdays in August.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays in August.\n\nBut maybe I should check the actual dates. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that from July 31 (Sunday) to October 2 (Sunday) is a total of how many days?\n\nLet me calculate the total days between July 31 and October 2 inclusive. July has 31 days, so from July 31 to July 31 is 1 day. Then August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October 2 is 2 days. Wait, no. Wait, the total days from July 31 to October 2 inclusive is (July 31 to August 31) is 31 days, then September has 30 days, and October 1 and 2 are 2 days. Wait, but that would be 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 2 (October 1-2) = 63 days? Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, July 31 is day 1. Then August has 31 days, so from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September has 30 days, so from August 31 to September 30 is 30 days. Then October 1 and 2 are 2 days. So total days from July 31 to October 2 inclusive is 31 + 30 + 2 = 63 days. Wait, but that would be 63 days total. But let me check with another method. Let's count the days between July 31 and October 2.\n\nJuly 31 is day 1. Then August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, no. Wait, if July 31 is day 1, then August 1 is day 2, August 2 is day 3, ..., August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, no. Wait, July 31 is day 1. Then August 1 is day 2, August 2 is day 3, ..., August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, that can't be. Wait, July 31 is day 1. Then August 1 is day 2, August 2 is day 3, ..., August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, that would mean that August has 31 days, so from August 1 to August 31 is 31 days. So July 31 to August 31 is 31 days (July 31 is day 1, August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, no. Wait, if July 31 is day 1, then August 1 is day 2, August 2 is day 3, ..., August 31 is day 32. So from July 31 to August 31 is 32 days. Then September has 30 days, so September 30 is day 32 + 30 = 62. Then October 1 is day 63, October 2 is day 64. Wait, but the end date is October 2, so that's 64 days total. But that contradicts my previous calculation. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula: (end date - start date + 1) days. So July 31 to October 2 inclusive. Let me check the actual dates. July 31 is day 1. Then August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32. Then September has 30 days, so September 30 is day 32 + 30 = 62. Then October 1 is day 63, October 2 is day 64. So total days is 64. So that's 64 days in total. So the total number of days between July 31 and October 2 inclusive is 64 days.\n\nNow, I need to find how many of those are weekdays (Monday-Friday). So the total days is 64. Now, the start date is Sunday, July 31. So the first day is Sunday. Then the next day is Monday, August 1. So the days of the week for each date can be determined.\n\nLet me list the days of the week for each date. Since July 31 is Sunday, August 1 is Monday. Let's count the days in each month.\n\nFirst, August: 31 days. So from August 1 (Monday) to August 31 (Wednesday). Wait, because July 31 is Sunday, August 1 is Monday, August 7 is Sunday, August 14 is Sunday, August 21 is Sunday, August 28 is Sunday, and August 31 is Wednesday. So August has 31 days. Let's count the number of weekends in August.\n\nWeekends in August are Saturdays and Sundays. Sundays in August are August 7, 14, 21, 28. That's 4 Sundays. Saturdays are August 6, 13, 20, 27. That's 4 Saturdays. So total weekends in August: 4 + 4 = 8 days. So weekdays in August: 31 - 8 = 23 days.\n\nThen September has 30 days. Let's check the days of the week for September. September 1 is Thursday (since August 31 is Wednesday, so September 1 is Thursday). So September 1 is Thursday, September 2 is Friday, September 3 is Saturday, September 4 is Sunday. Then the weekends in September are Saturdays and Sundays. Let's count them.\n\nSundays in September: September 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 4 Sundays. Saturdays: September 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. Wait, September has 30 days, so September 31 doesn't exist. So Saturdays in September are September 3, 10, 17, 24. That's 4 Saturdays. So total weekends in September: 4 + 4 = 8 days. So weekdays in September: 30 - 8 = 22 days.\n\nThen October 1 is Saturday (since September 30 is a Wednesday, so October 1 is Thursday? Wait, wait, September 30 is a Wednesday? Wait, September 1 is Thursday. September 30 is 29 days later. Let me check. September has 30 days. So September 1 is Thursday. September 2 is Friday, September 3 is Saturday, September 4 is Sunday. Then September 5 is Monday, and so on. So September 30 is 29 days after September 1. Let's calculate the day of the week for September 30. Since September 1 is Thursday, adding 29 days. 29 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 1 day. So September 30 is Thursday + 1 day = Friday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, September 1 is Thursday. September 8 is Thursday, 15, 22, 29. So September 29 is Thursday. Then September 30 is Friday. So October 1 is Saturday. Therefore, October 2 is Sunday. Which matches the given end date.\n\nSo in October, the first two days are Saturday (October 1) and Sunday (October 2). So the weekends in October are October 1 (Saturday) and October 2 (Sunday). So that's 2 days. But since the end date is October 2, which is included, we need to count that. So in October, the weekends are 2 days. Therefore, the weekdays in October are 2 days (October 3 is Monday, but since we only go up to October 2, which is Sunday, there are no weekdays in October beyond that. Wait, but the end date is October 2, so the only days in October are October 1 and 2. So in October, there are 2 days, both weekends. So weekdays in October: 0.\n\nSo total weekdays would be August's 23 + September's 22 + October's 0 = 45 days. Wait, but let me check again. Wait, August has 23 weekdays, September 22, October 0. Total 45. But wait, the start date is July 31 (Sunday), which is a weekend. So that day is excluded from the weekdays. But the problem says to include both start and end dates. So the count includes July 31 (Sunday) and October 2 (Sunday). But since we are counting weekdays (Monday-Friday), those two Sundays are not counted. So the total weekdays would be 23 (August) + 22 (September) + 0 (October) = 45. But wait, let me check again. Wait, August has 23 weekdays. Let me check that again. August has 31 days. 8 weekends, so 23 weekdays. September has 30 days, 8 weekends, so 22 weekdays. October has 2 days, both weekends. So total 23 + 22 = 45. But wait, what about the start date? July 31 is Sunday, which is a weekend. So it's not counted. The end date is October 2, which is Sunday, also not counted. So the total is 45 weekdays. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the weekends in August and September.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays in the entire period.\n\nLet me try that approach. Starting from July 31 (Sunday), the next day is Monday, August 1. So the first weekday is August 1 (Monday). Let's count the number of each weekday in the period.\n\nFirst, August:\n\nAugust 1 is Monday. Then August 2 is Tuesday, 3 is Wednesday, 4 is Thursday, 5 is Friday, 6 is Saturday, 7 is Sunday, 8 is Monday, etc. So in August, the number of Mondays would be 4 (August 1, 8, 15, 22, 29). Wait, August has 31 days. Let's count the Mondays. August 1 is Monday. Then 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 5 Mondays. Wait, August 29 is a Monday. Then August 30 is Tuesday, 31 is Wednesday. So that's 5 Mondays in August. Similarly, Tuesdays: August 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5 Tuesdays. Wednesdays: August 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. 5 Wednesdays. Thursdays: August 4, 11, 18, 25. 4 Thursdays. Fridays: August 5, 12, 19, 26. 4 Fridays. So total weekdays in August: 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 23. Which matches the previous calculation. So that's correct.\n\nSeptember: September 1 is Thursday. So the first day of September is Thursday. Let's count the weekdays in September. September has 30 days. Let's count the number of each weekday.\n\nMondays in September: September 4, 11, 18, 25. That's 4 Mondays. Tuesdays: 5, 12, 19, 26. 4 Tuesdays. Wednesdays: 6, 13, 20, 27. 4 Wednesdays. Thursdays: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. 5 Thursdays. Fridays: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. 5 Fridays. So total weekdays in September: 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 22. Which matches the previous calculation.\n\nOctober: October 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday. So no weekdays in October. So total weekdays is 23 + 22 = 45. Therefore, the answer should be 45.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The total days between July 31 and October 2 inclusive is 64 days. If there are 45 weekdays, then the number of weekends would be 64 - 45 = 19. But earlier I calculated 8 (August) + 8 (September) + 2 (October) = 18. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, 8 + 8 is 16, plus 2 is 18. So 64 - 18 = 46. But according to the weekday count, it's 45. So there's a mistake here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the weekend count. Let me check again. August has 8 weekends (4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays). September has 8 weekends (4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays). October has 2 weekends (Saturday and Sunday). So total weekends: 8 + 8 + 2 = 18. So total days: 18 + 45 = 63. But earlier I thought the total days is 64. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have made a mistake in the total days calculation.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the total days. July 31 is day 1. August has 31 days, so August 31 is day 31 + 1 = 32? Wait, no. If July 31 is day 1, then August 1 is day 2, August 2 is day 3, ..., August 31 is day 32. Then September 1 is day 33, September 30 is day 33 + 29 = day 62. Then October 1 is day 63, October 2 is day 64. So total days is 64. So that's correct. So 64 days total. But according to the weekend count, 18 weekends, so 64 - 18 = 46 weekdays. But according to the weekday count, it's 45. So there's a discrepancy of 1. Where is the mistake?\n\nLet me check the weekday count again. August has 23 weekdays, September 22, October 0. Total 45. But according to the total days minus weekends, it's 64 - 18 = 46. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the weekend count. Let me check the"], [74, "How many Tuesdays are there from Saturday, October 29, 2022 to Sunday, October 30, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many Tuesdays are there from Saturday, October 29, 2022, to Sunday, October 30, 2022, inclusive. So I need to figure out the days of the week for those dates and count the Tuesdays.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week October 29, 2022, was. The user mentioned it's a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If October 29 is a Saturday, then October 30 would be a Sunday. So the period is from Saturday the 29th to Sunday the 30th. \n\nNow, the question is, are there any Tuesdays in this two-day period? Well, if the first day is a Saturday, then the next day is Sunday. So the days in between are Saturday and Sunday. There's no Tuesday in there. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me think. If October 29 is a Saturday, then October 30 is a Sunday. So the two days are Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, there are no Tuesdays in this range. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should verify the actual calendar. But since the user provided that October 29 is a Saturday, I can take that as given. So the answer should be zero Tuesdays.", "0"], [74, "Between Saturday, April 9, 2022 and Friday, July 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Friday occur? Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how many Fridays there are between Saturday, April 9, 2022, and Friday, July 1, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. First, I should check the dates to make sure I have the correct start and end points. The problem says both dates are counted, so that's important.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of days between those two dates, then determine how many Fridays are in that period. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of weeks and the extra days, then see how many Fridays fall into that.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates or find the day of the week for each date. Let me think. Let's start by checking what day of the week April 9, 2022, was. The problem says it's a Saturday. So April 9 is a Saturday. Then, the next day, April 10, is a Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo the period starts on a Saturday, April 9, and ends on Friday, July 1. Let me figure out how many days are in each month between those dates. April has 30 days, so from April 9 to April 30 is 22 days (since April 9 is day 1, then April 10 is day 2, etc. Wait, no. Wait, if April 9 is day 1 (Saturday), then April 10 is day 2 (Sunday), and so on. So from April 9 to April 30 inclusive, how many days? Let's calculate that. April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. Wait, 30 minus 9 is 21, plus 1 is 22. So that's 22 days in April.\n\nThen May has 31 days, and June has 30 days. Then July 1 is the end date. So total days from April 9 to July 1 inclusive would be 22 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July 1)? Wait, no. Wait, April 9 to April 30 is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 22 + 31 = 53 days. Then June has 30 days, so adding that gives 53 + 30 = 83 days. But wait, July 1 is the end date. So if we go from April 9 to July 1 inclusive, that's 22 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July 1)? Wait, no. Wait, April 9 to April 30 is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 22 + 31 = 53 days. Then June has 30 days, so adding that gives 53 + 30 = 83 days. But July 1 is the next day after June 30. So if the period ends on July 1, then the total days would be 22 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July 1)? Wait, no. Wait, the total days from April 9 to July 1 inclusive is (April 9 to April 30) is 22 days, then May (31 days), June (30 days), and July 1 is 1 day. So total is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1? Wait, that would be 84 days. But that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm adding too much. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of days between April 9 and July 1 inclusive can be calculated by subtracting the start date from the end date. But since I don't have a calculator here, maybe I should break it down.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 = 21 days, but since both start and end are inclusive, it's 21 + 1 = 22 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 22 + 31 = 53. Then June has 30 days, so adding that gives 53 + 30 = 83. Then July 1 is the next day, so adding 1 day would make it 84. But wait, if the end date is July 1, then the total days from April 9 to July 1 inclusive is 84 days? Let me check with another method. Let's count the days in each month:\n\nApril: 30 days. From April 9 to April 30 is 22 days (as before). May has 31 days. June has 30 days. July 1 is 1 day. So total is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1? Wait, that's 22 + 31 is 53, plus 30 is 83, plus 1 is 84. So total 84 days. So the total number of days between April 9 and July 1 inclusive is 84 days.\n\nNow, to find the number of Fridays in that period. Since the first day is a Saturday, April 9, then the next day is Sunday, April 10, and so on. So the first Friday would be April 11 (since April 9 is Saturday, April 10 is Sunday, April 11 is Monday? Wait, wait, no. Wait, April 9 is Saturday. Then April 10 is Sunday, April 11 is Monday, April 12 is Tuesday, April 13 is Wednesday, April 14 is Thursday, April 15 is Friday. So the first Friday in April is April 15. Wait, but that's after April 9. So the first Friday in the period is April 15. Then the next Fridays would be every 7 days. So let's see.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of weeks in 84 days. 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks. So 12 weeks would be exactly 84 days. So that would mean there are 12 Fridays in that period. But wait, if the period starts on a Saturday and ends on a Friday, then each week has one Friday. So 12 weeks would have 12 Fridays. But wait, let me check. If the first day is Saturday, then the first Friday is the 6th day (since Saturday is day 1, Sunday 2, Monday 3, Tuesday 4, Wednesday 5, Thursday 6, Friday 7). Wait, no. Wait, April 9 is Saturday. So April 9 is day 1 (Saturday). Then April 10 is day 2 (Sunday), April 11 is day 3 (Monday), April 12 is day 4 (Tuesday), April 13 is day 5 (Wednesday), April 14 is day 6 (Thursday), April 15 is day 7 (Friday). So the first Friday is day 7. Then the next Friday is day 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84. Wait, but the total days are 84. So day 84 is July 1, which is a Friday. So that would mean that there are 12 Fridays in total. Because each week has one Friday, and there are 12 weeks. But wait, let me count the number of Fridays. Let's list them:\n\nFirst Friday: April 15 (day 7)\nSecond: April 22 (day 14)\nThird: April 29 (day 21)\nFourth: May 6 (day 28)\nFifth: May 13 (day 35)\nSixth: May 20 (day 42)\nSeventh: May 27 (day 49)\nEighth: June 3 (day 56)\nNinth: June 10 (day 63)\nTenth: June 17 (day 70)\nEleventh: June 24 (day 77)\nTwelfth: July 1 (day 84)\n\nYes, that's 12 Fridays. So the answer should be 12. But wait, let me check if the total days are indeed 84. Because if the period is from April 9 to July 1 inclusive, and that's 84 days, then yes. But maybe I made a mistake in calculating the days. Let me check again.\n\nApril 9 to April 30: 30 - 9 = 21 days, plus 1 is 22 days. May has 31 days, June has 30 days. So 22 + 31 + 30 = 83 days. Then July 1 is the next day, so adding 1 day makes it 84. So that's correct. So 84 days. 84 divided by 7 is 12. So 12 Fridays. Therefore, the answer is 12.", "12"], [74, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check if the dates are correct. Wait, the start date is October 24, 2022, which is a Monday. The end date is January 16, 2022, which is also a Monday. But wait, January 16, 2022, is actually before October 24, 2022. That can't be right. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the question? Because January 16 is earlier than October 24. So maybe the end date is supposed to be later? Or maybe it's a mistake in the question. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)\". But that would mean the period is from a later date to an earlier one, which doesn't make sense. Unless there's a mistake in the dates. Maybe the end date is supposed to be January 16, 2023? Or maybe the start date is supposed to be earlier? Because otherwise, the period would be negative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual dates. October 24, 2022 is a Monday. January 16, 2022 is a Monday. But January 16 is earlier than October 24. So the period from October 24 to January 16 would be going backward in time. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the question. Maybe the end date is supposed to be January 16, 2023? Let me check that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the period would be from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. But the original question says 2022. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the start date is supposed to be January 16, 2022, and the end date is October 24, 2022? But the user wrote the start date as October 24 and end as January 16. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual dates again. October 24, 2022 is a Monday. January 16, 2022 is a Monday. But that's not possible because January 16 is earlier than October 24. So the period would be from a later date to an earlier one. Therefore, the correct way is to reverse the dates. So maybe the user intended to ask from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022? But that's not what's written. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the year. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check the calendar for 2022. October 24, 2022 is a Monday. January 16, 2022 is a Monday. But that's not possible because January 16 is earlier than October 24. Therefore, the correct period must be from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. But the user wrote the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023. Let me check that. January 16, 2023 is a Monday. So if the start date is October 24, 2022 (Monday), and the end date is January 16, 2023 (Monday), then the period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. That would make sense. But the user wrote 2022 for both dates. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Since the question is unclear, but given that the start date is October 24, 2022, and the end date is January 16, 2022, which is earlier, I need to check if there's a way to calculate the days between them. But since the start date is later than the end date, the period would be negative. Therefore, the correct approach is to reverse the dates. \n\nAssuming that the user made a mistake and the end date is January 16, 2023, then I can proceed. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2022, but that's earlier than October 24. Therefore, the correct way is to calculate the number of business days from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. \n\nBut since the user wrote the dates as given, I need to check if there's a way to interpret it. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days between those two dates, but in reverse. However, that would be a negative number, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the question. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023. Let me check that. Let me confirm the dates. October 24, 2022 is a Monday. January 16, 2023 is a Monday. So if the period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023, inclusive, then that's a valid period. \n\nBut the user wrote both dates as 2022. So maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of business days from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, but that's impossible. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to assume that the end date is January 16, 2023, and proceed with that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates, and the correct end date is January 16, 2023. So I'll proceed with that. \n\nSo, the period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023, inclusive. Now, I need to calculate the number of business days between these two dates, excluding weekends. \n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of days between the two dates, then subtract the weekends. \n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of weeks and days between the dates, then subtract the weekends. \n\nLet me first check the dates. October 24, 2022, is a Monday. January 16, 2023, is a Monday. So the period starts and ends on a Monday. \n\nLet me calculate the total number of days between October 24, 2022, and January 16, 2023. \n\nFirst, October has 31 days. So from October 24 to October 31 is 31 - 24 = 7 days. Then November has 30 days, December has 31 days, and January 16 is 16 days. So total days from October 24 to January 16 is 7 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 16 (January) = 7 + 30 = 37, 37 + 31 = 68, 68 + 16 = 84 days. But since the period is inclusive of both dates, the total days would be 84. Wait, but if you count from October 24 to October 31 inclusive, that's 8 days (24th to 31st). Then November has 30 days, December 31, and January 16. So total days would be 8 + 30 + 31 + 16 = 85 days? Wait, maybe I need to calculate it more carefully. \n\nAlternatively, using a date calculator. Let me think. From October 24, 2022, to October 25, 2022, is 1 day. So from October 24 to October 31 is 8 days (including both). Then November has 30 days, so adding 30 days. December has 31 days, adding 31 days. Then January 16 is 16 days. So total days would be 8 + 30 + 31 + 16 = 85 days. But since the start and end dates are both included, that's correct. \n\nBut wait, if the start date is October 24 and the end date is January 16, then the total number of days is 85. But let me check with another method. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula: \n\nNumber of days between two dates can be calculated by subtracting the start date from the end date. But since I don't have a calculator here, I need to compute it manually. \n\nOctober 24 to October 31: 8 days (including both). \n\nNovember: 30 days. \n\nDecember: 31 days. \n\nJanuary 1 to January 16: 16 days. \n\nTotal: 8 + 30 + 31 + 16 = 85 days. \n\nSo total days between October 24 and January 16 inclusive is 85 days. \n\nNow, since the start and end dates are both Mondays, and the period is 85 days, which is 12 weeks and 1 day (since 12*7=84, so 85 days is 12 weeks and 1 day). \n\nIn 12 weeks, there are 12*5 = 60 business days. Then, the remaining 1 day is a Monday (since the start is a Monday). So that day is a business day. Therefore, total business days would be 60 + 1 = 61. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. If the period is 85 days, starting on a Monday and ending on a Monday, then the number of weeks is 85 / 7 = 12 weeks and 1 day. So 12 weeks is 84 days, which is 12*5 = 60 business days. The remaining 1 day is the 85th day, which is a Monday. So that's another business day. So total is 61. \n\nBut wait, the total days are 85, so the number of business days would be 85 - number of weekends. \n\nAlternatively, the number of weekends is the number of Saturdays and Sundays in the period. \n\nSince the period starts on a Monday, the first day is a Monday, and the last day is a Monday. \n\nIn 85 days, how many weekends are there? \n\nEach week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). \n\nIn 12 weeks (84 days), there are 12*2 = 24 weekend days. \n\nThe remaining 1 day is a Monday, which is a business day. So total weekend days are 24. \n\nTherefore, business days are 85 - 24 = 61. \n\nSo the answer would be 61. \n\nBut wait, the original question says the end date is January 16, 2022, which is earlier than October 24, 2022. So if the user made a mistake in the dates, and the correct end date is January 16, 2023, then the answer is 61. \n\nBut if the user intended the end date to be January 16, 2022, then the period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, which is impossible. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 61, assuming that the end date is January 16, 2023. \n\nBut the user wrote both dates as 2022. So maybe there's a mistake in the question. However, given that the user provided the dates as such, perhaps I should check if there's another way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023, but made a typo. Therefore, I'll proceed with that.", "61"], [74, "On which weekday did October 1, 2022 fall? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022 fell on. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I might remember that certain dates in a year are known to be specific days.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know for sure. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. July 4, 2022: if I count the days from a known date, maybe that's easier.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 1, 2022 is 273 days after January 1, 2022. Wait, but how does that help? Well, if I know the day of the week for January 1, 2022, then I can count forward. But I need to make sure that January 1, 2022 was indeed a Saturday. Let me think. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that again. For example, if I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday, then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Yes, that seems right. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 273 days would get me to October 1, 2022. But how many weeks and days is 273 days? 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks exactly. Wait, 7 times 39 is 273. So that would mean October 1, 2022 is also a Saturday? But that can't be right because if January 1 is Saturday, then adding 273 days (which is exactly 39 weeks) would still be Saturday. But I think that's not correct because October 1 is not 273 days after January 1. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the number of days between January 1 and October 1.\n\nLet me count the days step by step. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 1). Then February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year), March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, and September 30. So adding up the days from January 1 to October 1:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (but since we start on January 1, the days from January 1 to October 1 would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 1 (Oct 1). Wait, no. Wait, October 1 is the first day of October, so the total days from January 1 to October 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 1 (Oct 1)? No, that's not right. Wait, the total days from January 1 to October 1 is the sum of the days in each month up to September, plus 1 day for October 1. Wait, no. Wait, if you start on January 1, then the number of days from January 1 to October 1 is the sum of the days in each month from January to September, plus 1 day (for October 1). Wait, no. Wait, if you have January 1 as day 1, then January 2 is day 2, etc. So the number of days from January 1 to October 1 is the sum of the days in each month from January to September, plus 1 day (for October 1). Wait, no. Wait, if you have January 1 as day 1, then the number of days from January 1 to October 1 is the sum of the days in each month from January to September, plus 1 day (for October 1). Wait, that can't be. Because if you add up the days from January to September, that's the total days up to September 30. Then October 1 is one day after that. So the total days from January 1 to October 1 is (sum of days from Jan to Sep) + 1. Let me calculate that.\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\n\nAdding those up: 31 + 28 = 59; 59 + 31 = 90; 90 + 30 = 120; 120 + 31 = 151; 151 + 30 = 181; 181 + 31 = 212; 212 + 31 = 243; 243 + 30 = 273. So the sum from January to September is 273 days. Therefore, October 1 is 273 + 1 = 274 days after January 1? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then September 30 is day 273. Then October 1 is day 274. So the number of days between January 1 and October 1 is 273 days. Wait, but that would mean that October 1 is 273 days after January 1. But 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks exactly. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 273 days (39 weeks) would still be a Saturday. But that can't be right because I think October 1, 2022 was a Saturday? Wait, but I need to check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the sum of days from January to September is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30. Let me add them step by step:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 31 + 28 = 59\nMarch: 59 + 31 = 90\nApril: 90 + 30 = 120\nMay: 120 + 31 = 151\nJune: 151 + 30 = 181\nJuly: 181 + 31 = 212\nAugust: 212 + 31 = 243\nSeptember: 243 + 30 = 273. Yes, that's correct. So September 30 is day 273. Therefore, October 1 is day 274. So the number of days between January 1 and October 1 is 273 days. So if January 1 is a Saturday, then October 1 is 273 days later. Since 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks, that would mean October 1 is also a Saturday. But I think that's not correct. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Because if January 1 is a Saturday, then adding 7 days would be the next Saturday. So adding 273 days (39 weeks) would be the same day of the week. So October 1 would be a Saturday. But I need to check if that's accurate. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me verify that.\n\nI can check an online calendar or use another method. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be one day later in the week. So Friday + 1 day is Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So that seems correct. Therefore, October 1, 2022 would be 273 days later, which is 39 weeks, so same day of the week. Therefore, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But wait, I think I might be wrong here. Because I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's see if that aligns with the calculation. July 4 is 181 days after January 1 (since January has 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, and July 4 is 4 days into July). Wait, let's calculate the days from January 1 to July 4. January 1 to June 30 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 181 days. Then July 4 is 4 days after June 30, so 181 + 4 = 185 days. So July 4 is day 185. If January 1 is a Saturday, then day 185 would be 185 - 1 = 184 days later. 184 divided by 7 is 26 weeks and 2 days. So Saturday + 2 days is Monday. That matches with the fact that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. So that seems correct. Therefore, the calculation for October 1 being 273 days later (39 weeks) would be Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to make sure that the number of days between January 1 and October 1 is indeed 273. Wait, earlier calculation said that September 30 is day 273, so October 1 is day 274. So the number of days between January 1 and October 1 is 273 days. Therefore, adding 273 days to January 1 (Saturday) would be 273 days later. Since 273 is 39 weeks, that's the same day. Therefore, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But I think I might be missing something here. Alternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, October 1, 2022. Let me check an actual calendar. Wait, I can't access the internet, but I can use another method. Let's take another known date. For example, October 1, 2022. If July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is a Friday (since July 4 is 3 days after July 1). Then August 1 is a Monday (since July has 31 days, which is 3 weeks and 3 days. So July 1 is Friday, July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. Then August 1 is 2 days after July 29, which is Sunday. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I should calculate the days from July 4 to August 1. July 4 is Monday. July 5 is Tuesday, July 6 is Wednesday, July 7 is Thursday, July 8 is Friday, July 9 is Saturday, July 10 is Sunday, July 11 is Monday. So July 11 is Monday. Then July 11 is 7 days after July 4, so that's correct. Then August 1 is 21 days after July 4 (July 4 to July 31 is 27 days, then August 1 is 1 day). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, if July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is 3 days before, which would be Friday. Then August 1 is 31 days after July 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Friday + 3 days is Monday. Therefore, August 1 is a Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. Then August 8 is Monday, August 15 is Monday, August 22 is Monday, August 29 is Monday. Then September 5 is Monday, September 12 is Monday, September 19 is Monday, September 26 is Monday. Then October 3 is Monday. Therefore, October 1 is 2 days before October 3, which would be Saturday. Therefore, October 1 is Saturday. That matches the previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Wednesday, September 21 to Wednesday, November 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Hmm. First, I should figure out the dates and check each Saturday in that range.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The start is September 21, 2022, which is a Wednesday. The end is November 30, 2022, also a Wednesday. So the period is exactly 3 months, but not sure if it's exactly 90 days or not. Wait, September has 30 days, October has 31, November has 30. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (including both ends?), wait no. Wait, if I start on the 21st, then the next day is 22nd, so from 21 to 30 is 10 days (21,22,...,30). Then October has 31 days, and November has 30. So total days from September 21 to November 30 inclusive would be (30-21+1) + 31 + 30 = 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the start date is September 21, and the end is November 30. So the total number of days is (September 21 to September 30 inclusive) is 10 days (since 30-21+1=10). Then October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. So total days would be 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. But wait, if the end date is November 30, then adding those days would be correct. But I need to check if that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a date calculator or check the actual dates. But since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think again. September 21 is a Wednesday. Let me check the days of the week for each month.\n\nWait, September 21, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let me count the days. Let's see:\n\nSeptember 21 (Wednesday), then September 22 is Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday. So the first Saturday in the period is September 24, 2022. Then the next Saturday would be October 1st (since September 24 is a Saturday, adding 7 days is October 1st). Then October 2nd is Sunday, etc. So each week has one Saturday. So I need to count how many weeks are in the period, and then check if there are any extra days that include a Saturday.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to list all the Saturdays between those dates. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, September 21 is Wednesday. So the first Saturday is September 24. Then each week after that. Let's list them:\n\nSeptember 24 (Sat)\nOctober 1 (Sat)\nOctober 8 (Sat)\nOctober 15 (Sat)\nOctober 22 (Sat)\nOctober 29 (Sat)\nNovember 5 (Sat)\nNovember 12 (Sat)\nNovember 19 (Sat)\nNovember 26 (Sat)\n\nWait, but the end date is November 30. So November 26 is a Saturday, then the next one would be December 3, but that's beyond the end date. So that's 10 Saturdays. Wait, let me count again:\n\nStarting from September 24:\n\n1. September 24\n2. October 1\n3. October 8\n4. October 15\n5. October 22\n6. October 29\n7. November 5\n8. November 12\n9. November 19\n10. November 26\n\nThat's 10 Saturdays. But wait, November 26 is a Saturday. Then November 30 is the end date. So that's correct. So the answer is 10?\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other Saturdays in between. For example, maybe I missed one. Let me check each month.\n\nSeptember: 24th is the first Saturday. Then the next one would be October 1st. So that's correct. Then October has 31 days, so 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th. That's four Saturdays. Then November has 30 days. November 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. That's four more. So total 1 + 4 + 4 = 9? Wait, but earlier I counted 10. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, September has one Saturday (24th), October has four (1,8,15,22,29? Wait, October has 31 days. Let me count the Saturdays in October. October 1 is Saturday. Then adding 7 days: 8, 15, 22, 29. That's four Saturdays. Then November 5, 12, 19, 26. That's four. So total is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9. But earlier I listed 10. Where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I added an extra one. Let me list them again:\n\nSeptember: 24 (1)\nOctober: 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 (5)\nNovember: 5, 12, 19, 26 (4)\nTotal: 1 + 5 + 4 = 10. Wait, but why did I think October has four? Because October 1 is Saturday, then adding 7 days gives 8, 15, 22, 29. That's four more, making 5 in October. So that's 1 (Sep) + 5 (Oct) + 4 (Nov) = 10. So that's correct. So the answer is 10?\n\nBut wait, let me check the dates again. Let me check if November 26 is indeed within the range. The end date is November 30. So November 26 is included. Then the next Saturday would be December 3, which is outside. So that's correct. So 10 Saturdays in total. Therefore, the answer is 10.", "10"], [74, "In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where January 1st is a Tuesday, what day of the week is April 3rd? I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, but since the question is about a specific year where January 1st is a Tuesday, maybe I need to assume it's not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that it doesn't matter? Wait, but if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. However, since the problem doesn't mention a leap year, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year. Let me check that assumption later.\n\nSo, assuming it's not a leap year, February has 28 days. Then March has 31 days. April 3rd is the 3rd day of April. So let's calculate the total days from January 1st to April 3rd.\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since we start counting from day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 58 + 31 = 89 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days after March 31st, so total days from January 1st is 89 + 3 = 92 days. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and April 3rd is 92 days? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 30 + 28 = 58. Then March has 31 days, so March 31st is day 58 + 31 = 89. Then April 1st is day 90, April 2nd is 91, April 3rd is 92. So yes, April 3rd is 92 days after January 1st.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Tuesday, I need to find what day of the week 92 days later is. Since each week has 7 days, I can divide 92 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the date is from Tuesday.\n\nSo 92 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7 times 13 is 91, so 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So the remainder is 1. That means April 3rd is 1 day after Tuesday. So Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is Tuesday, then adding 7 days would be Tuesday again. So 91 days later is also Tuesday. Then 92 days later is one day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. So the answer should be Wednesday?\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount the days from January 1st to April 3rd.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to 58 + 31 = 89 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days after March 31st, so 89 + 3 = 92 days. So that's correct. So 92 days later.\n\nNow, 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks (91 days) and 1 day. So 91 days later is Tuesday again, then 92 days is Wednesday. So the answer should be Wednesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days for each month. Let's see:\n\nJanuary 1st is Tuesday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Tuesday. Then January 8th is also Tuesday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Tuesday. Wait, but that's maybe not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of days in each month and see how many weeks and days that is.\n\nBut maybe another way is to use modular arithmetic. Since 92 days later is 92 mod 7. 7*13=91, so 92 mod 7 is 1. So adding 1 day to Tuesday gives Wednesday. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1st to April 3rd.\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 30 days (since Jan 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March has 31 days, adding 31 days. Then April 3 is 3 days. So total is 30 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 92. Wait, no. Wait, 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 3 is 92. Yes, that's correct. So 92 days.\n\nSo 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 13 weeks later is the same day, Tuesday. Then 1 day later is Wednesday. So April 3rd is a Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be Wednesday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's take a known date. For example, if January 1st is Tuesday, then January 8th is also Tuesday. Let's count the days in each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 29 is Tuesday (since 28 days later is Tuesday again). Then January 30 is Wednesday, January 31 is Thursday. Then February 1 is Friday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is Friday (since 28 days later is same day). Then March 1 is Saturday. March has 31 days, so March 1 is Saturday. March 7 is Saturday, March 14, 21, 28. March 29 is Saturday, March 30 is Sunday, March 31 is Monday. Then April 1 is Tuesday. April 2 is Wednesday, April 3 is Thursday. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, what's going on here?\n\nWait, according to this, April 1st is Tuesday. Then April 2 is Wednesday, April 3 is Thursday. But according to the previous calculation, April 3rd should be Wednesday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, so where is the mistake here? Let me check again.\n\nIf January 1 is Tuesday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 8: Tuesday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 22: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 29: Tuesday\n\nThen January 30: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 31: Thursday\n\nFebruary 1: Friday\n\nFebruary 2: Saturday\n\nFebruary 3: Sunday\n\n...\n\nFebruary 28: Friday (since 28 days later is same day as February 1, which is Friday. So February 28 is Friday. Then March 1 is Saturday.\n\nMarch 1: Saturday\n\nMarch 2: Sunday\n\nMarch 3: Monday\n\nMarch 4: Tuesday\n\nMarch 5: Wednesday\n\nMarch 6: Thursday\n\nMarch 7: Friday\n\nMarch 8: Saturday\n\nMarch 9: Sunday\n\nMarch 10: Monday\n\nMarch 11: Tuesday\n\nMarch 12: Wednesday\n\nMarch 13: Thursday\n\nMarch 14: Friday\n\nMarch 15: Saturday\n\nMarch 16: Sunday\n\nMarch 17: Monday\n\nMarch 18: Tuesday\n\nMarch 19: Wednesday\n\nMarch 20: Thursday\n\nMarch 21: Friday\n\nMarch 22: Saturday\n\nMarch 23: Sunday\n\nMarch 24: Monday\n\nMarch 25: Tuesday\n\nMarch 26: Wednesday\n\nMarch 27: Thursday\n\nMarch 28: Friday\n\nMarch 29: Saturday\n\nMarch 30: Sunday\n\nMarch 31: Monday\n\nApril 1: Tuesday\n\nApril 2: Wednesday\n\nApril 3: Thursday\n\nSo according to this, April 3 is Thursday. But earlier calculation said Wednesday. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, so where is the mistake in the first calculation? The first calculation said that 92 days later is 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. But according to this step-by-step counting, April 3 is Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nLet me check the number of days again. From January 1 to April 3 is 92 days. But if January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is day 92. But when I count step by step, April 3 is Thursday. So if January 1 is Tuesday, then day 0 is Tuesday. Then day 1 is Wednesday, day 2 is Thursday, etc. So day 92 would be 92 days after Tuesday. Let's compute 92 mod 7. 7*13=91, so 92 mod 7 is 1. So day 92 is 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. But according to the step-by-step count, it's Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the mistake is in the step-by-step count. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to April 3.\n\nJanuary 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. But if January 1 is day 0, then January 31 is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so day 30 + 28 = day 58. March has 31 days, so day 58 + 31 = day 89. Then April 3 is day 89 + 3 = day 92. So that's correct. So day 92 is 92 days after January 1.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step count, April 3 is Thursday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the step-by-step count is wrong. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to April 3.\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday (day 0)\n\nJanuary 2: Wednesday (1)\n\nJanuary 3: Thursday (2)\n\n...\n\nJanuary 7: Monday (6)\n\nJanuary 8: Tuesday (7)\n\nSo that's correct. Then January 8 is Tuesday. Then January 15 is Tuesday (day 14), January 22 (day 21), January 29 (day 28). Then January 30 is Wednesday (day 29), January 31 is Thursday (day 30). Then February 1 is Friday (day 31). February 2 is Saturday (32), February 3 is Sunday (33), ..., February 28 is day 31 + 27 = day 58. So February 28 is day 58. Then March 1 is day 59. March 1 is Saturday. Then March 1 is Saturday. March 8 is Saturday (day 66), March 15 (day 73), March 22 (day 80), March 29 (day 87). Then March 30 is Sunday (day 88), March 31 is Monday (day 89). Then April 1 is Tuesday (day 90), April 2 is Wednesday (91), April 3 is Thursday (92). So according to this, April 3 is Thursday. But according to the first calculation, 92 mod 7 is 1, so day 92 is 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. But according to this step-by-step count, it's Thursday. So why is there a difference?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the mistake is in the calculation of 92 mod 7. Let me check that again. 7*13 is 91. 92-91=1. So 92 mod 7 is 1. So day 92 is 1 day after Tuesday. But according to the step-by-step count, day 92 is Thursday. So that would mean that Tuesday + 1 day is Thursday? That can't be. So there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the problem is that the day count is wrong. Let me check the day numbers again.\n\nIf January 1 is day 0 (Tuesday), then day 0 is Tuesday. Then day 1 is Wednesday, day 2 is Thursday, day 3 is Friday, day 4 is Saturday, day 5 is Sunday, day 6 is Monday, day 7 is Tuesday. So each week is 7 days. So day 7 is Tuesday again. So day 91 would be Tuesday (since 91 is 13*7). Then day 92 would be Wednesday. But according to the step-by-step count, day 92 is Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the step-by-step count is wrong. Let me check the day numbers again. Let's count the days from January 1 to April 3.\n\nJanuary 1: day 0 (Tuesday)\n\nJanuary 2: day 1 (Wednesday)\n\nJanuary 3: day 2 (Thursday)\n\n...\n\nJanuary 7: day 6 (Monday)\n\nJanuary 8: day 7 (Tuesday)\n\nSo that's correct. Then January 8 is day 7 (Tuesday). Then January 15 is day 14 (Tuesday). January 22 is day 21 (Tuesday). January 29 is day 28 (Tuesday). Then January 30 is day 29 (Wednesday), January 31 is day 30 (Thursday). February 1 is day 31 (Friday). February 2 is day 32 (Saturday). February 3 is day 33 (Sunday). February 4 is day 34 (Monday). February 5 is day 35 (Tuesday). February 6 is day 36 (Wednesday). February 7 is day 37 (Thursday). February 8 is day 38 (Friday). February 9 is day 39 (Saturday). February 10 is day 40 (Sunday). February 11 is day 41 (Monday). February 12 is day 42 (Tuesday). February 13 is day 43 (Wednesday). February 14 is day 44 (Thursday). February 15 is day 45 (Friday). February 16 is day 46 (Saturday). February 17 is day 47 (Sunday). February 18 is day 48 (Monday). February 19 is day 49 (Tuesday). February 20 is day 50 (Wednesday). February 21 is day 51 (Thursday). February 22 is day 52 (Friday). February 23 is day 53 (Saturday). February 24 is day 54 (Sunday). February 25 is day 55 (Monday). February 26 is day 56 (Tuesday). February 27 is day 57 (Wednesday). February 28 is day 58 (Thursday). Wait, here's the mistake! Earlier I thought February 28 was Friday, but according to this, it's Thursday. So that's where the error was. So February 28 is day 58, which is Thursday. Then March 1 is day 59 (Friday). March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is day 66 (Friday), March 15 is day 73 (Friday), March 22 is day 80 (Friday), March 29 is day 87 (Friday). Then March 30 is day 88 (Saturday), March 31 is day 89 (Sunday). Then April 1 is day 90 (Monday), April 2 is day 91 (Tuesday), April 3 is day 92 (Wednesday). Wait, that's different from before. So according to this, April 3 is Wednesday. But earlier when I counted step by step, I thought April 1 was Tuesday. But that was wrong. So where did I go wrong before?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the previous step-by-step count. Let me retrace. If February 28 is day 58 (Thursday), then March 1 is day 59 (Friday). So March 1 is Friday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 8 is Friday (day 66), March 15 (day 73), March 22 (day 80), March 29 (day 87).

Now, I need to count all the Saturdays in this range.\n\nLet me start by checking the first day, June 30, 2022. That's a Thursday. So the next day, July 1, 2022, is a Friday.

Let's check each date:\n\nJuly 2 is after June 30, so included. September 3 is before September 6, so included. So all 10 are within the range. Therefore, the answer should be 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the dates and then divide by 7, but since the start and end dates might not align perfectly, it's better to list them. But let me check if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's calculate the total number of days from June 30 to September 6. June has 30 days, so June 30 is the last day of June. July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September 6 is the 6th day of September.

I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, July 17, 2022, to Tuesday, August 23, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. July 17, 2022 is a Sunday. The end date is August 23, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let me confirm the days of the week for these dates to make sure. July 17 is a Sunday. Then July 18 is Monday, 19 Tuesday, 20 Wednesday, 21 Thursday, 22 Friday, 23 Saturday, 24 Sunday, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total number of days from July 17 to August 23 inclusive. Let's break it down by months. July has 31 days, so from July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days (including both ends). Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total days would be 15 + 23 = 38 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, July 17 to July 31: July 17 is day 1, July 18 is day 2, ..., July 31 is day 15. Then August 1 is day 16, and August 23 is day 16 + 22 = day 38. So total 38 days.\n\nNow, out of these 38 days, how many are weekends? Let's count the Sundays and Saturdays.\n\nStarting from July 17 (Sunday), the next Sundays would be July 24, 31, and then August 7, 14, 21, 28. Wait, but August 28 is beyond our end date of August 23. So in July, the Sundays are July 17, 24, 31. Then in August, the Sundays are August 7, 14, 21. But our end date is August 23, so August 21 is a Sunday, and August 22 is Monday, 23 is Tuesday. So in the period from July 17 to August 23, the Sundays are July 17, 24, 31, and August 7, 14, 21. That's 6 Sundays. Then Saturdays would be the days before Sundays. So in July, the Saturdays are July 16, 23. Then in August, the Saturdays are August 6, 13, 20. Let's check: July 16 is a Saturday (since July 17 is Sunday), July 23 is Saturday. Then August 6 is Saturday, 13, 20. August 27 would be next, but that's beyond our end date. So that's 3 Saturdays in August. So total Saturdays are 2 (July) + 3 (August) = 5. So total weekends are 6 Sundays + 5 Saturdays = 11 days.\n\nTherefore, the number of business days would be total days (38) minus weekends (11) = 27 days. Wait, but let me check again.

So the first Tuesday in this period is May 24, 2022.\n\nThen each week after that. Let me count the number of weeks between May 18 and June 3. Let's calculate the total days first. From May 18 to May 31: May has 31 days. So from May 18 to May 31 is 31 - 18 = 13 days, but since both dates are inclusive, wait, no. Wait, if I start on May 18, then May 18 is day 1, May 19 is day 2, etc. So from May 18 to May 31 inclusive is 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total days is 14 + 3 = 17 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, May 18 to May 31 is 14 days (since 31-18=13, plus 1 is 14). Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total is 14 + 3 = 17 days. So the total period is 17 days.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. Let's count the days between May 18 and June 3 inclusive. Let's see:\n\nMay has 31 days. So from May 18 to May 31 is 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total is 14 + 3 = 17 days. So 17 days in total.\n\nNow, since the first day is Wednesday, May 18, and the last day is Friday, June 3. So the days of the week would be:\n\nMay 18: Wednesday\n\nMay 19: Thursday\n\nMay 20: Friday\n\nMay 21: Saturday\n\nMay 22: Sunday\n\nMay 23: Monday\n\nMay 24: Tuesday (first Tuesday)\n\nMay 25: Wednesday\n\nMay 26: Thursday\n\nMay 27: Friday\n\nMay 28: Saturday\n\nMay 29: Sunday\n\nMay 30: Monday\n\nMay 31: Tuesday\n\nJune 1: Wednesday\n\nJune 2: Thursday\n\nJune 3: Friday\n\nSo let's list all the Tuesdays in this period. From the above, May 24 is Tuesday, May 31 is Tuesday. Then June 3 is Friday, so no more Tuesdays. So that's two Tuesdays. Wait, but wait, May 24 and May 31. That's two Tuesdays. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, May 24 is Tuesday. Then adding 7 days would be May 31, which is also a Tuesday. Then adding another 7 days would be June 7, which is outside the range. So yes, only two Tuesdays. But wait, the total days are 17. Let me check if that's correct. Let me count the days again.\n\nFrom May 18 to May 31: 14 days. Then June 1-3 is 3 days. So 14 + 3 = 17 days. So 17 days in total. Now, if the first day is Wednesday, then the days of the week would cycle every 7 days. So the first Tuesday is day 5 (since Wednesday is day 1, Thursday 2, Friday 3, Saturday 4, Sunday 5? Wait no, wait. Wait, May 18 is Wednesday. So:\n\nDay 1: Wednesday (May 18)\n\nDay 2: Thursday (May 19)\n\nDay 3: Friday (May 20)\n\nDay 4: Saturday (May 21)\n\nDay 5: Sunday (May 22)\n\nDay 6: Monday (May 23)\n\nDay 7: Tuesday (May 24)\n\nSo the first Tuesday is day 7. Then the next Tuesday is day 14 (May 31). Then day 21 would be June 7, which is outside the range. So in the 17 days, there are two Tuesdays: day 7 and day 14. So that's two Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer should be 2.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me list all the dates and their days:\n\nMay 18: Wednesday\n\nMay 19: Thursday\n\nMay 20: Friday\n\nMay 21: Saturday\n\nMay 22: Sunday\n\nMay 23: Monday\n\nMay 24: Tuesday\n\nMay 25: Wednesday\n\nMay 26: Thursday\n\nMay 27: Friday\n\nMay 28: Saturday\n\nMay 29: Sunday\n\nMay 30: Monday\n\nMay 31: Tuesday\n\nJune 1: Wednesday\n\nJune 2: Thursday\n\nJune 3: Friday\n\nYes, that's correct. So May 24 and May 31 are the two Tuesdays. So the answer is 2. Therefore, the numerical value is 2.", "2"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 24 to Friday, June 24, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Express your answer as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between April 24, 2022 (Sunday) and June 24, 2022 (Friday), including both dates. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates.\n\nStarting on April 24, 2022, which is a Sunday. The next day, April 25 is a Monday. Then April 26 is Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday. Then April 30 is Saturday. May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday, and so on until June 24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down month by month. Let's start with April.\n\nApril 24 is Sunday. Let's count the days in April after that. April has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30: that's 7 days. But since April 24 is Sunday, April 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So in April, from the start date (24th) to the end of April (30th), there are 7 days. Now, how many weekdays are in that period?\n\nApril 24 is Sunday (not a weekday), 25 is Monday (count), 26 Tuesday (count), 27 Wednesday (count), 28 Thursday (count), 29 Friday (count), 30 Saturday (not). So that's 5 weekdays in April (Mon-Fri).\n\nThen May. May has 31 days. Let's see. May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday, 2 Monday, 3 Tuesday, 4 Wednesday, 5 Thursday, 6 Friday, 7 Saturday, 8 Sunday, etc. So in May, each week has 5 weekdays. Since May has 31 days, that's 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks would be 20 weekdays, plus the extra 3 days. Let's check: May 1 is Sunday, so the first week (May 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri). Then May 8-14: same, 5 weekdays. May 15-21: 5. May 22-28: 5. Then May 29-31: May 29 is Monday, 30 Tuesday, 31 Wednesday. So that's 3 weekdays. So total in May is 4*5 +3 = 23 weekdays.\n\nThen June. June 24 is Friday. June has 30 days. Let's check the days. June 1 is a Wednesday (since May 31 is Wednesday, right? Wait, May 31 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Thursday? Wait, no. Wait, May 31 is Wednesday. Then June 1 is Thursday. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, May 31 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Thursday. Then June 2 is Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, 6 Tuesday, 7 Wednesday, etc. So June 24 is Friday. Let's count the days in June from June 1 to June 24. June has 30 days, so from June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 24 days is 3 weeks and 3 days. So 3 weeks would be 15 weekdays (3*5). Then the extra 3 days: June 1 is Thursday, 2 Friday, 3 Saturday. So the first three days of June (Thu, Fri, Sat) are part of the period. Wait, but the period starts on June 1. Wait, the original problem is from April 24 to June 24. So June starts on June 1 (Thursday) and ends on June 24 (Friday). So the days in June would be from June 1 to June 24. So the first three days of June (Thu, Fri, Sat) are part of the period. Then the next weeks. So the total weekdays in June would be 3 weeks (15) plus the first three days (Thu, Fri, Sat). Wait, but Saturday is a weekend. So in the first three days, Thursday (weekday), Friday (weekday), Saturday (weekend). So that's 2 weekdays. Then the remaining days from June 4 (Sunday) to June 24. Wait, maybe I should count the weekdays in June from June 1 to June 24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of days in June between June 1 and June 24, then subtract the weekends. Let's see. June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. Let's count the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. Let's list the days:\n\nJune 1: Thursday\nJune 2: Friday\nJune 3: Saturday (weekend)\nJune 4: Sunday (weekend)\nJune 5: Monday\nJune 6: Tuesday\nJune 7: Wednesday\nJune 8: Thursday\nJune 9: Friday\nJune 10: Saturday\nJune 11: Sunday\nJune 12: Monday\nJune 13: Tuesday\nJune 14: Wednesday\nJune 15: Thursday\nJune 16: Friday\nJune 17: Saturday\nJune 18: Sunday\nJune 19: Monday\nJune 20: Tuesday\nJune 21: Wednesday\nJune 22: Thursday\nJune 23: Friday\nJune 24: Saturday (weekend)\n\nWait, but June 24 is the end date, which is Friday? Wait, the original problem says the end date is June 24, 2022, which is a Friday. Wait, but according to my previous calculation, June 24 is Saturday. That must be a mistake. Let me check again. Wait, May 31 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Thursday. Then June 2 is Friday, June 3 is Saturday, June 4 is Sunday, June 5 is Monday, June 6 is Tuesday, June 7 is Wednesday, June 8 is Thursday, June 9 is Friday, June 10 is Saturday, June 11 is Sunday, June 12 is Monday, June 13 is Tuesday, June 14 is Wednesday, June 15 is Thursday, June 16 is Friday, June 17 is Saturday, June 18 is Sunday, June 19 is Monday, June 20 is Tuesday, June 21 is Wednesday, June 22 is Thursday, June 23 is Friday, June 24 is Saturday. Wait, but the problem says June 24 is a Friday. That's conflicting. So maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for May 31.\n\nWait, let me check the actual dates. Let me check what day of the week April 24, 2022 was. The user said it's Sunday. So April 24 is Sunday. Then April 25 is Monday. April 26 is Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 2 is Monday. May 3 is Tuesday, 4 Wednesday, 5 Thursday, 6 Friday, 7 Saturday, 8 Sunday, 9 Monday, 10 Tuesday, 11 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, 13 Friday, 14 Saturday, 15 Sunday, 16 Monday, 17 Tuesday, 18 Wednesday, 19 Thursday, 20 Friday, 21 Saturday, 22 Sunday, 23 Monday, 24 Tuesday, 25 Wednesday, 26 Thursday, 27 Friday, 28 Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. So May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, June 1 is Wednesday. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday, June 5 is Sunday, June 6 is Monday, June 7 is Tuesday, June 8 is Wednesday, June 9 is Thursday, June 10 is Friday, June 11 is Saturday, June 12 is Sunday, June 13 is Monday, June 14 is Tuesday, June 15 is Wednesday, June 16 is Thursday, June 17 is Friday, June 18 is Saturday, June 19 is Sunday, June 20 is Monday, June 21 is Tuesday, June 22 is Wednesday, June 23 is Thursday, June 24 is Friday. Ah, there we go. So June 24 is Friday, which matches the problem statement. So my earlier mistake was in the day of the week for May 31. So that's corrected now.\n\nSo June 1 is Wednesday. So the days in June from June 1 to June 24 are:\n\nJune 1: Wednesday\nJune 2: Thursday\nJune 3: Friday\nJune 4: Saturday\nJune 5: Sunday\nJune 6: Monday\nJune 7: Tuesday\nJune 8: Wednesday\nJune 9: Thursday\nJune 10: Friday\nJune 11: Saturday\nJune 12: Sunday\nJune 13: Monday\nJune 14: Tuesday\nJune 15: Wednesday\nJune 16: Thursday\nJune 17: Friday\nJune 18: Saturday\nJune 19: Sunday\nJune 20: Monday\nJune 21: Tuesday\nJune 22: Wednesday\nJune 23: Thursday\nJune 24: Friday\n\nNow, let's count the weekdays (Monday-Friday) in June from June 1 to June 24. Let's go through each day:\n\nJune 1: Wednesday (weekday)\nJune 2: Thursday (weekday)\nJune 3: Friday (weekday)\nJune 4: Saturday (weekend)\nJune 5: Sunday (weekend)\nJune 6: Monday (weekday)\nJune 7: Tuesday (weekday)\nJune 8: Wednesday (weekday)\nJune 9: Thursday (weekday)\nJune 10: Friday (weekday)\nJune 11: Saturday (weekend)\nJune 12: Sunday (weekend)\nJune 13: Monday (weekday)\nJune 14: Tuesday (weekday)\nJune 15: Wednesday (weekday)\nJune 16: Thursday (weekday)\nJune 17: Friday (weekday)\nJune 18: Saturday (weekend)\nJune 19: Sunday (weekend)\nJune 20: Monday (weekday)\nJune 21: Tuesday (weekday)\nJune 22: Wednesday (weekday)\nJune 23: Thursday (weekday)\nJune 24: Friday (weekday)\n\nNow, let's count how many of these are weekdays. Let's list them:\n\n1. June 1 (W)\n2. June 2 (Th)\n3. June 3 (F)\n4. June 6 (M)\n5. June 7 (T)\n6. June 8 (W)\n7. June 9 (Th)\n8. June 10 (F)\n9. June 13 (M)\n10. June 14 (T)\n11. June 15 (W)\n12. June 16 (Th)\n13. June 17 (F)\n14. June 20 (M)\n15. June 21 (T)\n16. June 22 (W)\n17. June 23 (Th)\n18. June 24 (F)\n\nSo that's 18 weekdays in June.\n\nNow, adding up the weekdays from April, May, and June:\n\nApril: 5 weekdays\nMay: 23 weekdays\nJune: 18 weekdays\nTotal: 5 + 23 + 18 = 46 weekdays.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because in April, from April 24 (Sunday) to April 30 (Saturday), that's 7 days. The weekdays are April 25 (Mon), 26 (Tue), 27 (Wed), 28 (Thu), 29 (Fri) \u2013 that's 5 weekdays. Correct.\n\nIn May, from May 1 (Sunday) to May 31 (Tuesday). May has 31 days. Let's check the number of weekdays again. May 1 is Sunday. So the first week (May 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri). Then May 8-14: 5 weekdays. May 15-21: 5. May 22-28: 5. Then May 29-31: May 29 is Monday, 30 Tuesday, 31 Wednesday. So that's 3 weekdays. So 4*5 +3 = 23. Correct.\n\nIn June, from June 1 (Wednesday) to June 24 (Friday), which is 24 days. As counted above, 18 weekdays. So total is 5+23+18=46.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let's calculate the total number of days between April 24 and June 24 inclusive, then subtract the number of weekends.\n\nFirst, calculate the total days. April 24 to June 24 is how many days?\n\nApril has 30 days. From April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (including both ends). Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days: 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. Wait, but that's 7 (April) + 31 (May) + 24 (June) = 62 days. But wait, April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (24-30 inclusive). Then May is 31 days. Then June 1-24 is 24 days. So total is 7 + 31 +24 = 62 days. So total days between April 24 and June 24 inclusive is 62 days.\n\nNow, how many weekends are in those 62 days? Let's calculate the number of Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nStarting from April 24 (Sunday), the first day is Sunday. Let's count the number of weekends.\n\nIn April: April 24 is Sunday, 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So in April, there is one Saturday (April 30) and one Sunday (April 24). So two weekend days in April.\n\nIn May: May 1 is Sunday. May has 31 days. Let's count the number of weekends. Each week has two weekend days. May has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks have 4*2=8 weekend days. The extra 3 days are May 29 (Monday), 30 (Tuesday), 31 (Wednesday). So no additional weekend days. So total weekends in May: 8.\n\nIn June: June 1 is Wednesday. June 24 is Friday. Let's count the weekends in June. The weekends are Saturday and Sunday. Let's see:\n\nJune 3 (Saturday), 4 (Sunday), 10 (Saturday), 11 (Sunday), 17 (Saturday), 18 (Sunday), 24 (Saturday? Wait, June 24 is Friday. So the last weekend in June would be June 17 (Saturday), 18 (Sunday). Then June 24 is Friday. So in June, the weekends are:\n\nJune 3, 4, 10, 11, 17, 18. That's 6 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period: April (2) + May (8) + June (6) = 16 weekend days.\n\nTotal days: 62. So weekdays would be 62 - 16 = 46. That matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 46.", "46"], [74, "If today is Wednesday, March 30, 2022, what day of the week was it 2 days ago?

And they want the complete weekday name, so I need to make sure I use the full name like \"Wednesday\" instead of just \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what day it was two days before Wednesday. Let me count backwards. If today is Wednesday, then one day ago would be Tuesday. So two days ago would be Monday. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Today is Wednesday. Subtract one day: Tuesday. Subtract another day: Monday. Yeah, that seems correct. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify with a calendar or some other method to be sure. Let me think. March 30, 2022, is a Wednesday. Let me check what day March 29 was. If March 30 is Wednesday, then March 29 would be Tuesday. Then March 28 would be Monday. So two days ago from March 30 would be March 28, which is Monday. That matches my previous conclusion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each week has seven days. So if I go back two days from Wednesday, it's Wednesday minus 2 days. Wednesday minus one day is Tuesday, minus another is Monday. So that's consistent. \n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be Monday.

Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what day of the week it was 56 days ago, given that today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022. Hmm, I need to figure out how to calculate that.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 56 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that: 56 divided by 7 is 8. Oh, so 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. That means 56 days ago would be the same day of the week as today. But wait, if today is Tuesday, then 56 days ago would also be a Tuesday? But wait, maybe I need to check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, but the problem says today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022. Let me confirm the date. February 8, 2022, is a Tuesday. So if I go back 56 days, which is exactly 8 weeks, then the day of the week should be the same. So the answer should be Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method to be sure. Let me count backwards. Let's take February 8, 2022, and subtract 56 days. Let's break it down. February has 28 days in 2022 because it's not a leap year. So February 8 minus 28 days would be January 1, 2022. Wait, but that's 28 days. Then subtract another 28 days: December 23, 2021. Then another 28 days: November 25, 2021. Wait, but 56 days is 8 weeks. So maybe I should check the day of the week for a date that's 56 days before. Alternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Since 56 divided by 7 is 8 with remainder 0, so 56 days ago is 0 weeks ago, which is the same day. Therefore, Tuesday. But maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's take a smaller number. For example, 7 days ago would be Tuesday as well. So 14 days ago would also be Tuesday. So 56 days ago, which is 8 times 7, should be Tuesday.

Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 1999. First, check if 1999 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1999 divided by 4. 4 times 499 is 1996, so 1999 minus 1996 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 1999 is not divisible by 4. Therefore, it doesn't meet the first condition.

I need to find out how many Tuesdays there are from Sunday, September 18, 2022, to Tuesday, November 15, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. Alright, first, maybe I should figure out the dates of each Tuesday in that period.\n\nFirst, let me check what day of the week September 18, 2022, is. The problem says it's a Sunday. So September 18 is a Sunday. Then the next day, September 19 is a Monday, September 20 is Tuesday. So the first Tuesday in the range is September 20, 2022.\n\nNow, I need to count all the Tuesdays from that date up to November 15, 2022, inclusive. Let me break this down into months. September, October, and November.\n\nStarting with September. The first Tuesday is September 20. Then each week after that. Let's count how many weeks are in September from September 20 to the end of the month. September has 30 days. So from September 20 to September 30 is 11 days. Let me check: 30 - 20 + 1 = 11 days. Wait, but that's including both ends. But since we're counting Tuesdays, let's see how many Tuesdays there are in September.\n\nSeptember 20 is a Tuesday. Then the next Tuesday is September 27. Then October 4, 11, 18, 25. Wait, but September only has 30 days. So September 20, 27 are the two Tuesdays in September. Then October starts.\n\nOctober has 31 days.

Let me check. November 1 is Tuesday, then 8, 15. Wait, that's three Tuesdays. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's check the dates again. Let me think. If September 20 is a Tuesday, then September 27 is the next Tuesday. Then October 4 is the next one. Then October 11, 18, 25. Then November 1, 8, 15. So that's 2 (September) + 5 (October) + 3 (November) = 10 Tuesdays? Wait, but wait, November 15 is included. Let me check each month again.\n\nWait, September: 20, 27. That's two.\n\nOctober: 4, 11, 18, 25. That's four. Wait, 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th. That's four Tuesdays. Then November: 1st, 8th, 15th. That's three. So total is 2 + 4 + 3 = 9? But wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me check the dates again. Let me check the actual dates. Let me think about the days.\n\nSeptember 18 is Sunday. So September 19 is Monday, 20 is Tuesday. Then September 27 is the next Tuesday. Then October 4 is Tuesday. Then October 11, 18, 25. Then November 1, 8, 15. So that's 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 Tuesdays. But wait, the end date is November 15, which is a Tuesday. So that's included. So that's 9 Tuesdays. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of Tuesdays in October. Let me check October.\n\nOctober has 31 days. Let's count the Tuesdays. Starting from October 4 (Tuesday). Then adding 7 days each time. 4, 11, 18, 25. Then the next one would be November 1. So that's four Tuesdays in October. Then November has 30 days. November 1 is Tuesday, then 8, 15. Then 22, 29. But since the end date is November 15, that's three Tuesdays in November. So total is 2 + 4 + 3 = 9. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the start and end dates and then divide by 7, but that might not be accurate because of the starting and ending days. But maybe that's a way to check.\n\nThe start date is September 18, 2022 (Sunday), and the end date is November 15, 2022 (Tuesday). Let's calculate the total number of days between these two dates inclusive.\n\nFirst, September has 30 days. From September 18 to September 30 is 13 days (including September 18). Then October has 31 days, and November 15 is 15 days into November. So total days = 13 (September) + 31 (October) + 15 (November) = 59 days. Wait, but that's from September 18 to November 15 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if you count from September 18 to September 30, that's 30 - 18 + 1 = 13 days. Then October is 31 days, and November 1 to 15 is 15 days. So total is 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. So 59 days in total.\n\nNow, if there are 59 days, then the number of Tuesdays would be 59 divided by 7, but since the first day is Sunday, the number of Tuesdays would be the number of times Tuesday occurs in that period.\n\nAlternatively, since the first day is Sunday, the first Tuesday is day 2 (September 20). Then each week after that. So the number of Tuesdays would be the number of weeks plus any extra days.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since the total days are 59, and the first day is Sunday, the number of Tuesdays can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach week has one Tuesday. So 59 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 3 days. So 8 Tuesdays in full weeks, plus the number of Tuesdays in the remaining 3 days. The first day is Sunday, so the first three days are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So that's one more Tuesday. So total Tuesdays would be 8 + 1 = 9. Which matches the previous count. So that's 9 Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer is 9.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because if the total days are 59, and the first day is Sunday, then the days of the week would be:\n\nDay 1: Sunday (Sep 18)\nDay 2: Monday (Sep 19)\nDay 3: Tuesday (Sep 20)\nDay 4: Wednesday (Sep 21)\n...\nDay 7: Saturday (Sep 24)\nDay 8: Sunday (Sep 25)\n...\nSo each week cycles. So in 59 days, how many Tuesdays?\n\nWell, the first Tuesday is day 3. Then every 7 days after that. So the Tuesdays would be on days 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59. Let's count those:\n\n3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52, 59. That's 9 Tuesdays. So that's correct. So the answer is 9.", "9"], [74, "Determine the day of the month for the last Saturday in November 2022.

First, I need to know what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, maybe I should check a calendar or use some method to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the days. Let's see. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then the following days would be: 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat). So the first Saturday is the 5th. Then each week after that. So the next Saturdays would be 12th, 19th, and 26th. Then the next one would be December 3rd, which is outside of November. So the last Saturday in November would be the 26th. Wait, but wait, let me check again. If November 1 is Tuesday, then adding 4 days gets to Saturday the 5th. Then adding 7 days each time. So 5 + 7 = 12, 12 +7=19, 19+7=26. Then 26 +7=33, which is December 1st. So yes, the last Saturday in November is the 26th. Therefore, the answer should be 26.", "26"], [74, "In a year where Monday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where January 1st is a Monday, what day of the week is March 3rd? I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 3rd. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think we can assume it's a common year, so 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd would be 30 (remaining days in January) + 28 (February) + 3 (March) = 61 days. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, so the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 2 (days in March up to the 3rd) minus 1? Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me count the days properly.\n\nJanuary 1st is day 0 (Monday). Then January 2nd is day 1 (Tuesday), and so on. So to find the day of the week for March 3rd, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1st and March 3rd, then find the remainder when divided by 7, since the days of the week cycle every 7 days.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days after February 28th. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 30 + 28 + 3 = 61 days. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then adding 61 days would take us to March 3rd. But wait, let me check that again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is day 0 (Monday). Then January 8th is day 7 (Monday again). So each week is 7 days. So if I can find how many weeks and extra days are in 61 days, then I can find the weekday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 3rd. Let's do that again. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 31 + 28 + 3 = 62 days? Wait, but that can't be right. Because if January 1st is day 1, then January 31st is day 31. But if January 1st is day 0, then January 31st is day 30. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIf January 1st is considered day 0 (Monday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Tuesday), and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd is (31 - 1) + 28 + 3 = 30 + 28 + 3 = 61 days. Because from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0, day 30 is January 31st). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days after February 28th, so adding 3 days. So total is 30 + 28 + 3 = 61 days. So 61 days after January 1st (Monday) is March 3rd.\n\nNow, to find the weekday, we can divide 61 by 7 and find the remainder. Because each week has 7 days. So 61 divided by 7 is 8 weeks (56 days) with a remainder of 5 days. Because 7*8=56, 61-56=5. So 5 days after Monday. Let's count: Monday (0) + 1 = Tuesday (1), +2 = Wednesday (2), +3 = Thursday (3), +4 = Friday (4), +5 = Saturday (5). So the remainder is 5, which would be Saturday. Wait, but wait, if the remainder is 5, then adding 5 days to Monday. Let me check again:\n\nMonday (0) + 1 day = Tuesday (1)\n+2 = Wednesday (2)\n+3 = Thursday (3)\n+4 = Friday (4)\n+5 = Saturday (5)\nYes, so the remainder is 5, so March 3rd is a Saturday. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the days step by step. Let's try that. January 1st is Monday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Monday. Then January 8th is Monday again. January 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. Wait, but March 3rd is three days after February 28th. Let's see. Let's count the days from January 1st to March 3rd.\n\nJanuary 1st is Monday. Let's count the days in January: 31 days. So January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February has 28 days, so February 1st is day 31, February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59, March 2nd is day 60, March 3rd is day 61. So March 3rd is day 61. Now, since each week is 7 days, 61 divided by 7 is 8 weeks (56 days) with a remainder of 5. So 5 days after Monday. So Monday + 5 days is Saturday. Therefore, March 3rd is a Saturday. So the answer should be Saturday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days from January 1st (Monday) to March 3rd. Let's count the days in each month:\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 31 + 28 + 3 = 62 days. Wait, but that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nAh, here's the confusion. If January 1st is day 0, then January 31st is day 30. Then February 28th is day 30 + 28 = day 58. Then March 3rd is day 58 + 3 = day 61. So that's 61 days. But if you count the days as 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 3 (March) = 62 days, that would be if you're counting the number of days from January 1st to March 3rd inclusive. But if you're starting on day 0, then the total days between January 1st and March 3rd is 61 days. So the correct number is 61 days. Therefore, 61 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 5 days. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. Therefore, March 3rd is a Saturday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with a specific example. Let's take a known year. For example, in 2023, January 1st was a Sunday. Let's check what day March 3rd was in 2023. Wait, but that's not helpful here because the problem says January 1st is a Monday. But maybe I can use another approach. Let's think of the days of the week.\n\nIf January 1st is Monday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Monday\n\nJanuary 8: Monday\n\nJanuary 15: Monday\n\nJanuary 22: Monday\n\nJanuary 29: Monday\n\nFebruary 5: Monday\n\nFebruary 12: Monday\n\nFebruary 19: Monday\n\nFebruary 26: Monday\n\nMarch 5: Monday\n\nSo March 5th is a Monday. Therefore, March 3rd is two days before March 5th. So March 5th is Monday, March 4th is Sunday, March 3rd is Saturday. That matches the previous calculation. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Tuesday, October 11 to Thursday, October 20, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between Tuesday, October 11 and Thursday, October 20, 2022, inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the dates involved. Let me check the dates. The start date is October 11, 2022, which is a Tuesday. The end date is October 20, 2022, which is a Thursday. So the period is from the 11th to the 20th, inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to count how many days are in this period and then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, I can list out each day and count the weekdays. Let me try both methods to verify.\n\nFirst method: Calculate total days and subtract weekends. Let's find the total number of days between October 11 and October 20, inclusive. October 11 is day 1, October 12 is day 2, ..., October 20 is day 10. Wait, from the 11th to the 20th inclusive, that's 20 - 11 + 1 = 10 days. So total days is 10.\n\nNow, out of these 10 days, how many are weekends? Let's list the days:\n\nOctober 11: Tuesday (weekday)\nOctober 12: Wednesday (weekday)\nOctober 13: Thursday (weekday)\nOctober 14: Friday (weekday)\nOctober 15: Saturday (weekend)\nOctober 16: Sunday (weekend)\nOctober 17: Monday (weekday)\nOctober 18: Tuesday (weekday)\nOctober 19: Wednesday (weekday)\nOctober 20: Thursday (weekday)\n\nSo the weekends here are October 15 (Saturday) and October 16 (Sunday). That's 2 weekend days. So total weekdays would be 10 total days minus 2 weekend days = 8 weekdays.\n\nAlternatively, counting the weekdays directly: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That's 8 days. So the answer should be 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check the dates. Let me confirm the days of the week for each date. October 11, 2022 is a Tuesday. Then:\n\n11: Tue\n12: Wed\n13: Thu\n14: Fri\n15: Sat\n16: Sun\n17: Mon\n18: Tue\n19: Wed\n20: Thu\n\nYes, that's correct. So the weekends are 15 and 16.

And I need to give the full weekday name, like \"Wednesday\" instead of \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 11th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question just says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So maybe I need to assume it's not a leap year unless specified? Or maybe it's a leap year? Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years. So maybe I should assume it's a common year, with 365 days. But wait, if January 1st is a Wednesday, then February 29th would be a certain day. But since the problem doesn't mention February 29th, maybe it's a non-leap year. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for March 11th. So if it's a non-leap year, February has 28 days. If it's a leap year, February has 29. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to check if the year is a leap year based on the given information. Wait, but how? Because if January 1st is a Wednesday, then the year could be a leap year or not. But maybe the problem is designed in such a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Or maybe not. Wait, but the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So maybe the year is not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, then February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't mention anything about February 29th, maybe it's a non-leap year. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to assume that the year is not a leap year. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days. So adding those, 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 11th is 11 days after February 28th. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 69 days? Wait, no. Wait, January 1st is day 0. Then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So the number of days between January 1st and March 11th is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 11 (days in March up to the 11th) minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find the number of days from January 1st to March 11th inclusive, but actually, since we're calculating the number of days between two dates, it's the difference. So from January 1st to March 11th is 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 11 (days in March) minus 1? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on January 1st, then the next day is January 2nd, so the number of days between January 1st and March 11th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 11 = 30 + 28 + 11 = 69 days. Wait, that's correct. Because from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 11th is 11 days after February 28th. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 30 + 28 + 11 = 69 days. Wait, but that would be 69 days after January 1st. So if January 1st is a Wednesday, then adding 69 days later would be March 11th. Now, I need to find what day of the week that is.\n\nBut how do I calculate that? Well, since each week has 7 days, I can divide 69 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the date is from Wednesday.\n\nSo 69 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7*9=63, 69-63=6. So the remainder is 6. So 69 days later is 6 days after Wednesday. Let's count:\n\nWednesday + 1 day is Thursday.\n\n+2: Friday.\n\n+3: Saturday.\n\n+4: Sunday.\n\n+5: Monday.\n\n+6: Tuesday.\n\nSo March 11th would be a Tuesday? Wait, but wait, is that correct? Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 11th is 11 days after February 28th. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 30 + 28 + 11 = 69 days. So that's correct. So 69 days later. 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Wednesday is Tuesday. So the answer would be Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1st is Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 8th is also Wednesday (7 days later).\n\nJanuary 15th is Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 22nd is Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 29th is Wednesday.\n\nThen February 5th is Wednesday (adding 6 days to January 29th).\n\nFebruary 12th is Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 19th is Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 26th is Wednesday.\n\nMarch 5th is Wednesday (adding 9 days to February 26th: 26 + 9 = 35, but wait, February 26th is day 26 of February. Wait, maybe I should count the days from January 1st to March 11th in another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of days from January 1st to March 11th as follows:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 11th is 11 days. So total days from January 1st to March 11th is 31 + 28 + 11 = 70 days. Wait, but that would be 70 days. But that's not correct because if you count from January 1st to January 31st, that's 31 days, but the number of days between January 1st and January 31st is 30 days. Wait, this is a common confusion. Let me clarify.\n\nIf January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and March 11th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 11 = 30 + 28 + 11 = 69 days. So that's correct. So 69 days later. So 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks (63 days) and 6 days. So 6 days after Wednesday is Tuesday. So March 11th is Tuesday. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. Let's start from January 1st (Wednesday).\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 22: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 29: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 5: Wednesday (adding 6 days to January 29th)\n\nFebruary 12: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 19: Wednesday\n\nFebruary 26: Wednesday\n\nMarch 5: Wednesday (adding 9 days to February 26th: 26 + 9 = 35 days in February? Wait, no. Wait, February 26th is day 26 of February. Adding 9 days would be March 5th. So March 5th is Wednesday. Then March 6th is Thursday, March 7th is Friday, March 8th is Saturday, March 9th is Sunday, March 10th is Monday, March 11th is Tuesday. So that's correct. So March 11th is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, I thought earlier that the total days were 69, which is 9 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Wednesday gives Tuesday. So that's consistent. So the answer should be Tuesday. But I need to make sure that the year is not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, February would have 29 days. Let's check that scenario. If it's a leap year, then from January 1st to March 11th would be 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 71 days. Wait, but that would be 71 days. 71 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 1 day. So 1 day after Wednesday is Thursday. But the problem didn't specify if it's a leap year. However, the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So if the year is a leap year, then February has 29 days. But how can we know if it's a leap year? Well, the problem doesn't mention anything about leap years, so maybe we have to assume it's not a leap year. Because if it were a leap year, the problem would probably mention that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed in such a way that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. But that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is set in a non-leap year. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If the year is a leap year, then the calculation would be different. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the answer is Tuesday. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed to assume that the year is not a leap year. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.

Then the third would be 18th, and the fourth would be 25th. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th. But wait, December has 31 days. So 25th is valid. So the answer should be 25. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can look up the actual calendar for December 2022. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards to find other dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 1st is 27 days after September 1st. Wait, but I need to know the day of the week for September 1st. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 1st is 31 days after September 1st. Wait, no, September has 30 days, so October 1st is the first day of October, so September 1st is 30 days before October 1st. Wait, that's not right. Wait, September has 30 days, so September 1st plus 30 days is October 1st. So if I can find the day of the week for September 1st, then adding 30 days (which is 4 weeks and 2 days) would give me the day for October 1st.\n\nBut how do I find September 1st, 2022? Let's think. If I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count the days from July 4 to September 1. Let's see: July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August has 31 days, so from August 1 to August 31 is 31 days. But September 1 is one day after August 31. So total days from July 4 to September 1 is 27 (July) + 31 (August) = 58 days. Wait, but that's from July 4 to August 31, then adding one day for September 1. So total 58 + 1 = 59 days. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check again. July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August has 31 days, so from July 4 to September 1 is 27 + 31 + 1 = 59 days? Wait, no. Wait, July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since July 4 is day 0, July 5 is day 1, etc., so July 31 is 27 days later). Then August has 31 days, so from July 4 to August 31 is 27 + 31 = 58 days. Then September 1 is one day after August 31, so total 59 days from July 4 to September 1. So if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 59 days. Now, 59 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 3 days. So 59 days later would be 8 weeks (56 days) plus 3 days. So Monday + 3 days is Thursday. Therefore, September 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Then October 1 is 30 days after September 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So Thursday + 2 days is Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but I need to confirm this because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another reference. For example, I know that October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think. Wait, if I can remember that October 1, 2022 is a Saturday, but I need to verify. Alternatively, maybe I can check using another method. Let's try using Zeller's Congruence. Zeller's formula for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for October 1, 2022, m is 10, and the year is 2022. So q is 1, m is 10, K is 22, J is 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (1 + floor((13*(10 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nfloor((13*11)/5) = floor(143/5) = floor(28.6) = 28\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n1 + 28 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 1 + 28 is 29, plus 22 is 51, plus 5 is 56, plus 5 is 61, plus 100 is 161.\n\nNow 161 mod 7. Since 7*23 is 161, so 161 mod 7 is 0. According to Zeller's formula, h=0 corresponds to Saturday. Therefore, October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "Count forward 80 days from Wednesday, July 6, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 80 days after Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Hmm, first, I should probably figure out the date 80 days later, then determine the weekday. But maybe there's a way to calculate the weekday without finding the exact date? Let me think.\n\nI remember that each week has 7 days, so if I divide 80 by 7, the remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is. Let me do that calculation. 80 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 3 days. Because 7 times 11 is 77, and 80 minus 77 is 3. So that means 80 days later is 3 days after Wednesday.\n\nStarting from Wednesday, adding 1 day would be Thursday, then Friday, then Saturday. So three days later would be Saturday. Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Let me double-check. Because sometimes when you count days, you might have to be careful with the starting day. For example, if today is Wednesday, then adding 1 day is Thursday, 2 days is Friday, 3 days is Saturday. So yes, that seems right.\n\nBut maybe I should verify by actually counting the days. Let's try that. Starting from July 6, 2022, which is a Wednesday. Let's count 80 days forward. But maybe breaking it down into months would help. July has 31 days. So July 6 plus 31 days would be August 1, 2022. Wait, but that's 31 - 6 = 25 days in July. Wait, no. Wait, July 6 plus 25 days would be July 31. Then adding 1 day would be August 1. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days. Then August has 31 days. So if I add 31 days to July 31, that would be September 30, but that's 31 days. Wait, maybe I need to count step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a calendar or a date calculator would be better, but since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try another approach. Let's count the number of days step by step. Starting from July 6, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count 80 days. But maybe it's easier to use the remainder method. Since 80 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 3 days, so adding 3 days to Wednesday. So Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday. But wait, maybe I should check if there's a leap year or something affecting the days? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're starting in July, that shouldn't affect the calculation. So I think the remainder method is correct here. Therefore, the weekday should be Saturday.", "Saturday"], [74, "If a meeting is scheduled on the second Thursday of May 2022, on which day of the month does it occur? Reply with the numerical value.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Thursday would be May 4th, right? Because May 1 is Sunday, so adding three days gets to Thursday. Then the second Thursday would be the next week, so May 11th. Wait, but wait, maybe I should check again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nStarting from May 1, 2022: Sunday. So:\n\n- May 1: Sunday\n- May 2: Monday\n- May 3: Tuesday\n- May 4: Wednesday? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the days. Let me think again. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday. Oh, right! So the first Thursday is May 5th. Then the second Thursday would be May 12th. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. So where did I go wrong before?\n\nWait, maybe I confused the days. Let me list them out properly. Let's take May 1 as Sunday. Then:\n\n- May 1: Sunday\n- May 2: Monday\n- May 3: Tuesday\n- May 4: Wednesday\n- May 5: Thursday (first Thursday)\n- May 6: Friday\n- May 7: Saturday\n- May 8: Sunday\n- May 9: Monday\n- May 10: Tuesday\n- May 11: Wednesday\n- May 12: Thursday (second Thursday)\n\nSo the second Thursday would be May 12th. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me check an actual calendar for May 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use another method. Let's think about the number of days in May. May has 31 days. If May 1 is Sunday, then the first week has 7 days. So the first Thursday is May 5th. Then the second Thursday is 7 days later, which is May 12th. Then the third would be May 19th, and the fourth would be May 26th. So the second Thursday is May 12th. Therefore, the answer should be 12. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial day.

Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date.

For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June has 30 days. So June 15 is 15 days into June. Let me think. If I can find the day of the week for a known date in June 2022, then I can count the days from there. For example, if I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday, then adding 14 days (which is two weeks) would get me to June 15, which would also be a Wednesday. Wait, but I need to confirm what day June 1, 2022 was.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a perpetual calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or calculations. Let me try to recall. I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. Wait, 2022 started on a Saturday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, January 2, 2022 was a Sunday, and so on. Now, let's count the days from January 1 to June 15.\n\nFirst, January has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday. Then, February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). March has 31 days, April has 30, May has 31, and June has 30. So to get to June 15, I need to add the days of each month up to June 15.\n\nLet me calculate the total number of days from January 1 to June 15. \n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28 days\nMarch: 31 days\nApril: 30 days\nMay: 31 days\nJune: 15 days (since we're stopping at June 15)\n\nTotal days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 = Let's add them step by step.\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 15 (June) = 166 days.\n\nSo June 15 is 166 days after January 1, 2022. Now, since January 1 was a Saturday, I need to find what day of the week 166 days later is. \n\nSince a week has 7 days, I can divide 166 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the date is from Saturday.\n\n166 divided by 7: 7*23 = 161, so 166 - 161 = 5. So the remainder is 5. That means 166 days later is 5 days after Saturday. \n\nSaturday + 1 day is Sunday, +2 is Monday, +3 is Tuesday, +4 is Wednesday, +5 is Thursday. So June 15, 2022 would be a Thursday?\n\nWait, but I need to check if my calculation of the number of days is correct. Let me recheck the total days. \n\nJanuary 1 to June 15: \n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February is 28 days, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 15. So adding those: 31 + 28 = 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 31 is 151, plus 15 is 166. That seems correct. \n\nSo 166 days from January 1, 2022 (Saturday). 166 divided by 7 is 23 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Saturday: Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. \n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if January 1 is a Saturday, then January 8 is also a Saturday, and so on. So if I count 166 days, that's 23 weeks (161 days) plus 5 days. So 161 days later is the same day, Saturday. Then adding 5 days would be Saturday + 5 days = Thursday. So June 15, 2022 would be a Thursday. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me cross-verify with another method. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's see if that aligns. \n\nJuly 4 is 31 days after June 30. So June 30 is 30 days before July 4. Let's check what day June 30 was. If July 4 is a Monday, then June 30 is 4 days before July 4. So July 4 is Monday, July 3 is Sunday, June 30 is Saturday. Wait, that would mean June 30 is a Saturday. Then June 15 is 15 days before June 30. So 15 days before Saturday. Let's count backwards. \n\nJune 30: Saturday\nJune 29: Friday\nJune 28: Thursday\nJune 27: Wednesday\nJune 26: Tuesday\nJune 25: Monday\nJune 24: Sunday\nJune 23: Saturday\nJune 22: Friday\nJune 21: Thursday\nJune 20: Wednesday\nJune 19: Tuesday\nJune 18: Monday\nJune 17: Sunday\nJune 16: Saturday\nJune 15: Friday\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. According to this, June 15 would be a Friday. But earlier calculation said Thursday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm, so where is the mistake? Let me check again. \n\nIf July 4 is a Monday, then June 30 is 4 days before July 4. So July 4 is Monday, July 3 is Sunday, June 30 is Saturday. So June 30 is Saturday. Then June 15 is 15 days before June 30. Let's count backwards 15 days from June 30. \n\nJune 30 (Saturday)\nJune 29 (Friday)\nJune 28 (Thursday)\nJune 27 (Wednesday)\nJune 26 (Tuesday)\nJune 25 (Monday)\nJune 24 (Sunday)\nJune 23 (Saturday)\nJune 22 (Friday)\nJune 21 (Thursday)\nJune 20 (Wednesday)\nJune 19 (Tuesday)\nJune 18 (Monday)\nJune 17 (Sunday)\nJune 16 (Saturday)\nJune 15 (Friday)\n\nSo according to this, June 15 is a Friday. But earlier calculation said Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. \n\nI think I might have confused the year. Let me recall that 2022 started on a Saturday. Wait, according to some sources I remember, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But if that's the case, then the calculation of 166 days later being Thursday would be conflicting with the other method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between January 1 and June 15. Let me recheck that. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so adding 28 days. March has 31, April 30, May 31, and June 15. So total days from January 1 to June 15 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15. Wait, no. Wait, if you're counting from January 1 to June 15, you need to add the days of each month up to June 15. So January is 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 15. So total is 31 + 28 = 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 31 is 151, plus 15 is 166. That's correct. \n\nSo 166 days from January 1, 2022 (Saturday). 166 divided by 7 is 23 weeks and 5 days. So 23 weeks later is Saturday, then adding 5 days: Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. But according to the other method, it's Friday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If I can confirm that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then the other calculation would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can use another known date. For example, I know that June 15, 2022 was a Wednesday? Wait, no, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I should use another approach. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Let me check that. If March 1 is Tuesday, then March 8 is Tuesday, and so on. Let's see. If March 1 is Tuesday, then March 15 is a Tuesday + 14 days (2 weeks) which is also Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days after March 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. Then April 1 is Friday. Then April 8 is Friday, April 15 is Friday, April 22 is Friday, April 29 is Friday. May 6 is Friday, May 13 is Friday, May 20 is Friday, May 27 is Friday. June 3 is Friday. Then June 15 is 12 days after June 3. June 3 is Friday, so adding 12 days: 12 divided by 7 is 1 week and 5 days. So Friday + 5 days is Wednesday. Wait, that would mean June 15 is a Wednesday. But this contradicts the previous two methods. \n\nThis is confusing. There must be a mistake in one of the assumptions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different known date. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. If July 1 is Friday, then June 30 is Thursday. Then June 15 is 15 days before June 30. So June 30 is Thursday. Then June 15 is 15 days before. Let's count backwards: June 30 (Thu), June 29 (Wed), June 28 (Tue), June 27 (Mon), June 26 (Sun), June 25 (Sat), June 24 (Fri), June 23 (Thu), June 22 (Wed), June 21 (Tue), June 20 (Mon), June 19 (Sun), June 18 (Sat), June 17 (Fri), June 16 (Thu), June 15 (Wed). So June 15 would be Wednesday. \n\nBut this contradicts the previous calculation where July 4 was Monday. So which is correct? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check the actual day. Wait, I think I remember that June 15, 2022 was a Wednesday. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 15, 2022 was a Wednesday. \n\nBut how to resolve the discrepancy? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is a Monday, then June 30 is Saturday. Then June 15 is Friday. But if July 1 is Friday, then June 30 is Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the actual calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday. February 12 is Saturday, February 19 is Saturday, February 26 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday, March 12 is Saturday, March 19 is Saturday, March 26 is Saturday, April 2 is Saturday, April 9 is Saturday, April 16 is Saturday, April 23 is Saturday, April 30 is Saturday. May 7 is Saturday, May 14 is Saturday, May 21 is Saturday, May 28 is Saturday. June 4 is Saturday, June 11 is Saturday, June 18 is Saturday, June 25 is Saturday. Then July 2 is Saturday. So July 4 would be Monday. Because July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. So that aligns with the previous calculation. \n\nSo if July 4 is Monday, then June 30 is Saturday. Then June 15 is 15 days before June 30. Let's count backwards from June 30 (Saturday). \n\nJune 30: Saturday\nJune 29: Friday\nJune 28: Thursday\nJune 27: Wednesday\nJune 26: Tuesday\nJune 25: Monday\nJune 24: Sunday\nJune 23: Saturday\nJune 22: Friday\nJune 21: Thursday\nJune 20: Wednesday\nJune 19: Tuesday\nJune 18: Monday\nJune 17: Sunday\nJune 16: Saturday\nJune 15: Friday\n\nSo according to this, June 15 is a Friday. But earlier, when I used the January 1 as Saturday and calculated 166 days later, I got Thursday. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the calculation of the number of days between January 1 and June 15. Let me check again. \n\nJanuary 1 to June 15: \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, March 31, April 30, May 31, and June 15. So total days from January 1 to June 15 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15. Wait, no. Wait, if you're counting from January 1 to June 15, you need to add the days of each month up to June 15. So January is 31 days, February is 28, March is 31, April is 30, May is 31, and June is 15. So total is 31 + 28 = 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120, plus 31 is 151, plus 15 is 166. So that's correct. \n\nBut if January 1 is Saturday, then 166 days later is Thursday. But according to the other method, it's Friday. So there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe the error is in the assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that again. \n\nI think I might have confused the year. Let me recall that 2021 started on a Monday. So 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday. Then 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no. Because 2021 has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be one day later in the week than January 1, 2021. Since 2021 started on a Monday, 2022 would start on a Tuesday. But I thought I remembered that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. That must be incorrect. \n\nWait, this is a critical mistake. If 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 would start on a Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, not a Saturday. That would"]]}
