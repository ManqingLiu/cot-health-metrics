Give the count numerically. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the first Wednesday of May 2022. I need to figure out which date that is. Hmm, I should start by recalling what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I think May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that again. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or some method to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if I know the day of the week for a specific date, I can count forward. Let's try to remember. For example, if May 1 is a Sunday, then May 2 is a Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday. So that would make the first Wednesday the 4th. But wait, is that correct? Wait, if May 1 is a Sunday, then the first Wednesday would be the 4th. But I need to confirm if May 1, 2022, was indeed a Sunday. Let me think. Wait, I think I remember that in 2022, May 1 was a Sunday. Let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar, but since I can't access that, I need to rely on my memory.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then I can count the days for May. Let's see. January has 31 days, so February has 28 (since 2022 is not a leap year), March has 31, April has 30, and May has 31. So from January 1 (Sunday) to May 1 would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) = 31+28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120 days. So 120 days after January 1, 2022, is May 1. Now, 120 days later. Since each week has 7 days, 120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Sunday would make it Monday. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, if January 1 is Sunday, then adding 120 days would be 17 weeks (119 days) plus 1 day. So May 1 would be a Monday. But that would mean that the first Wednesday would be May 3, because May 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, 3 is Wednesday. But that would make the first Wednesday the 3rd. But earlier I thought it was the 4th. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the number of days. Let me check again. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days brings us to April 1. Then April has 30 days, so adding 30 days brings us to May 1. So total days from January 1 to May 1 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 = 120 days. So that's correct. So 120 days from January 1 (Sunday) is May 1. 120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks (119 days) and 1 day. So May 1 is a Monday. Therefore, the first Wednesday would be May 3. Because May 1 is Monday, May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday is the 3rd. But wait, that contradicts my initial thought. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the actual calendar for May 2022. Wait, I think I remember that May 2022 started on a Monday. So if May 1 is a Monday, then the first Wednesday would be the 3rd. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates. For example, if May 1 is a Monday, then May 3 is Wednesday. So the first Wednesday is the 3rd. But I need to make sure that May 1 is indeed a Monday. Let me think again. January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Then January 2 is Monday. So January 1 is Sunday. Then, adding 31 days (January) brings us to February 1. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 would be a Wednesday. Then February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks. So March 1 would be a Wednesday. Then March has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days. So April 1 would be a Saturday. Then April has 30 days, which is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 would be a Monday. Yes, that's correct. So May 1 is a Monday. Therefore, the first Wednesday is May 3. So the answer should be 3. But wait, the question says \"the first Wednesday of May 2022\". So if May 1 is Monday, then the first Wednesday is the 3rd. Therefore, the answer is 3. But I need to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the day calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let me think about the actual calendar. For example, if I look up May 2022, the first week starts on Monday, May 2. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe the first week of May starts on May 1. But if May 1 is a Monday, then the first week would include May 1-7. So the first Wednesday would be May 3. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 3. But I need to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the day calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me check the number of days from January 1, 2022, to May 1. January has 31 days, so 31 days. Then February 28, March 31, April 30. So 31 + 28 = 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120. So 120 days. 120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 1 day. So January 1 is Sunday, adding 1 day is Monday. So May 1 is Monday. Therefore, the first Wednesday is May 3. So the answer is 3. Therefore, the first Wednesday of May 2022 is the 3rd. Answer: 3.", "3"], [124, "Between Tuesday, November 8, 2022 and Friday, December 16, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Answer with a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, November 8, 2022, and Friday, December 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by checking each week.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. November 8, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to calculate it. Let me think. Let's see, November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, November 1, 2022 was a Tuesday? Let me check. Wait, I think I need to recall that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then, adding days... Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the number of weekends. Let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days from November 8 to December 16, inclusive. Let's calculate the days in each month.\n\nNovember has 30 days. So from November 8 to November 30 inclusive is 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 days. Then December has 16 days. So total days would be 23 + 16 = 39 days. Wait, but wait, November 8 is included, and December 16 is included. So that's correct. So total days is 39.\n\nNow, out of these 39 days, how many are weekends? Let's figure out how many Saturdays and Sundays there are between those dates.\n\nStarting from November 8, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let's list the days of the week for each date.\n\nNovember 8: Tuesday\nNovember 9: Wednesday\nNovember 10: Thursday\nNovember 11: Friday\nNovember 12: Saturday\nNovember 13: Sunday\nNovember 14: Monday\nNovember 15: Tuesday\nNovember 16: Wednesday\nNovember 17: Thursday\nNovember 18: Friday\nNovember 19: Saturday\nNovember 20: Sunday\nNovember 21: Monday\nNovember 22: Tuesday\nNovember 23: Wednesday\nNovember 24: Thursday\nNovember 25: Friday\nNovember 26: Saturday\nNovember 27: Sunday\nNovember 28: Monday\nNovember 29: Tuesday\nNovember 30: Wednesday\n\nSo from November 8 to November 30, that's 23 days. Let's count the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNovember 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 6 weekends. Wait, let me check again:\n\nNovember 12: Saturday\nNovember 13: Sunday\nNovember 19: Saturday\nNovember 20: Sunday\nNovember 26: Saturday\nNovember 27: Sunday\nThat's 6 days. So 6 weekend days in November.\n\nThen December 1 to December 16. Let's check the days of the week for those.\n\nDecember 1, 2022: Thursday (since November 30 is Wednesday, so December 1 is Thursday). Let's confirm that. November 30 is Wednesday, so December 1 is Thursday. Then:\n\nDecember 1: Thursday\nDecember 2: Friday\nDecember 3: Saturday\nDecember 4: Sunday\nDecember 5: Monday\nDecember 6: Tuesday\nDecember 7: Wednesday\nDecember 8: Thursday\nDecember 9: Friday\nDecember 10: Saturday\nDecember 11: Sunday\nDecember 12: Monday\nDecember 13: Tuesday\nDecember 14: Wednesday\nDecember 15: Thursday\nDecember 16: Friday\n\nSo from December 1 to December 16, that's 16 days. The weekends here are December 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun). That's 4 weekend days.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period are 6 (November) + 4 (December) = 10 days.\n\nTotal days between the two dates is 39. So business days would be 39 - 10 = 29 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me recount the weekends in November.\n\nNovember 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun). That's 6 days. Correct.\n\nIn December, December 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun). That's 4 days. So total 10 weekends. So 39 total days minus 10 weekends equals 29 business days. So the answer should be 29?\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from November 8 (Tuesday) to December 16 (Friday). Let's count each week.\n\nFrom November 8 (Tuesday) to November 11 (Friday) is 4 days (Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri). Then November 12 is Saturday, 13 Sunday, 14 Monday, 15 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 17 Thursday, 18 Friday, 19 Saturday, 20 Sunday, 21 Monday, 22 Tuesday, 23 Wednesday, 24 Thursday, 25 Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday. Then December 1 (Thursday), 2 (Fri), 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 5 (Mon), 6 (Tue), 7 (Wed), 8 (Thu), 9 (Fri), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 12 (Mon), 13 (Tue), 14 (Wed), 15 (Thu), 16 (Fri).\n\nSo let's count the business days:\n\nFrom November 8 to November 11: 4 days (Tue-Fri).\n\nThen November 14 (Mon) to November 18 (Fri): 5 days (Mon-Fri).\n\nThen November 21 (Mon) to November 25 (Fri): 5 days.\n\nThen November 28 (Mon) to November 30 (Wed): 3 days (Mon-Wed).\n\nThen December 1 (Thu) to December 5 (Mon): 5 days (Thu-Mon).\n\nDecember 6 (Tue) to December 10 (Sat): but wait, December 10 is Saturday, so business days up to December 16.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too fragmented. Alternatively, let's count each week.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the total days (39) minus weekends (10) = 29. But let me check with another method.\n\nAnother way: Let's count the number of weeks between the dates. From November 8 to December 16 is 39 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 39 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 4 days. So 5 weeks is 35 days, plus 4 days. So 5 weeks would have 5*5=25 business days (since each week has 5 business days). Then the remaining 4 days would be from November 8 (Tuesday) to November 11 (Friday), which is 4 business days. So total would be 25 + 4 = 29. That matches the previous calculation. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29.", "29"], [124, "Tell me whether 1940 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1940 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 1940 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 1940 divided by 4. 4 times 485 is 1940, right? So 4 x 485 = 1940. That means 1940 is divisible by 4. So that's the first condition satisfied.\n\nNext, check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 1940 divided by 100 is 19.4, which isn't a whole number. So 1940 isn't a century year. Therefore, the second condition about being divisible by 400 doesn't apply here.\n\nSince 1940 is divisible by 4 and not a century year, it should be a leap year. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me calculate 1940 divided by 4 again. 4 times 400 is 1600, subtract that from 1940, you get 340. 4 times 85 is 340. So 400 + 85 is 485. So yes, 4 x 485 is indeed 1940. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, since it's divisible by 4 and not a century year, 1940 is a leap year. I think that's right. Let me just confirm with another method. If I look at the years, leap years occur every 4 years. So 1940 would be a leap year if it's in that sequence. For example, 1936 was a leap year, 1940 should be next. So that aligns with the calculation. So I think the answer is yes.", "Yes"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the second Tuesday in November 2022. Give the count numerically.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then the first Tuesday would be the 1st. Then the second Tuesday would be the 8th. But wait, maybe I should check again. Let me think. If November 1 is a Tuesday, then adding 7 days would make the next Tuesday the 8th. So the second Tuesday would be the 8th. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the count. The first Tuesday is the 1st, the second would be the 8th. But I need to make sure that November 2022 actually has at least two Tuesdays. Since November has 30 days, and if the first Tuesday is the 1st, then there are multiple Tuesdays. So the second one would be the 8th. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think of the days of the week for November 2022. Let me recall that November 4, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, if November 1 is a Tuesday, then November 2 is Wednesday, 3 is Thursday, 4 is Friday. So that's correct. Then the next Tuesday would be the 8th. So the second Tuesday is the 8th. Therefore, the answer should be 8. But wait, maybe I should check another source. Alternatively, I can think of the calendar for November 2022. Let me try to recall. For example, November 7, 2022, was a Monday. Then November 8 would be a Tuesday. So that's the second Tuesday.

Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that January 1st fell on a Saturday, and I need to find out what day of the week January 10th is. Alright, so first, I need to figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 10th. Well, from the 1st to the 10th is 9 days later, right? Because if you count from the 1st to the 2nd is one day, so 10 minus 1 is 9 days.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Saturday, adding 9 days to that. Let me think about how the days of the week cycle. There are 7 days in a week, so every 7 days, the cycle repeats. So, if I divide 9 by 7, the remainder will tell me how many days beyond the week cycle I need to count.\n\nLet me do the division: 9 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 2. So that means 9 days later is 1 full week (7 days) plus 2 days. So starting from Saturday, adding 7 days would still be Saturday. Then adding 2 more days: Saturday plus 1 day is Sunday, plus another day is Monday. So January 10th should be a Monday?\n\nWait, let me check again.

Hmm, first, I should figure out how many weeks and extra days are in 51 days because weeks are 7 days, so dividing 51 by 7 will tell me how many full weeks and remaining days there are. \n\nSo 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks with a remainder of 2 days. Because 7 times 7 is 49, and 51 minus 49 is 2. So that means 51 days later is 7 weeks and 2 days after the starting date. Since 7 weeks is exactly a week, the weekday will be the same as the starting day, which is Friday. Then adding 2 days to Friday. \n\nFriday plus one day is Saturday, plus another day is Sunday. So the weekday should be Sunday. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should count each day step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting from Friday, November 11, 2022. Let's count 51 days forward. Let me think about the days. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or check if there's a leap year involved, but 2022 isn't a leap year. Wait, but November 11 is a Friday. Let me check the actual dates. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, adding 51 days is the same as adding 51 mod 7 days. 51 divided by 7 is 7*7=49, remainder 2. So 51 mod 7 is 2. So adding 2 days to Friday. Friday + 1 is Saturday, +2 is Sunday. So that seems correct. \n\nBut maybe I should verify with a specific date. Let's see, November 11, 2022 is a Friday. Let me check what day November 18, 2022 is. That's 7 days later, so also a Friday. Then November 25 is another Friday. December 2 is a Friday. Then December 9, 16, 23, 30. Then January 6, 13, 20, 27, 2023.

So I need to figure out what day of the week March 14th falls on.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 14th. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think we can assume it's a common year with 28 days. Then March 14th is 14 days into March.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me count again. If January 1st is Sunday, then January 1st is day 0. So January 2nd is day 1, which is Monday. So to find March 14th, I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1st to March 14th, then find the remainder when divided by 7 to determine the weekday.\n\nSo January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 14th is 14 days after February 28th. So total days from January 1st to March 14th is 58 + 14 = 72 days.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 1st is Sunday. So January 1st is day 0 (Sunday), January 2nd is day 1 (Monday), and so on. So the total number of days from January 1st to March 14th is 72 days. But since we start counting from day 0, the number of days between January 1st and March 14th is 72 days. So to find the weekday, we can take 72 divided by 7 and find the remainder.\n\n72 divided by 7 is 10 weeks (70 days) with a remainder of 2. So 72 days later is 10 weeks and 2 days. Since January 1st is Sunday, adding 2 days would be Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. Wait, but wait. Wait, if day 0 is Sunday, then day 1 is Monday, day 2 is Tuesday. So if March 14th is 72 days after January 1st, then the remainder is 2, so it's 2 days after Sunday, which is Tuesday. So March 14th would be a Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total days. Let me check again. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 14th is 14 days. So total days is 30 + 28 + 14 = 72. Yes, that's correct. So 72 days later. 72 divided by 7 is 10*7=70, remainder 2. So 2 days after Sunday is Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step. January 1st is Sunday.

Hmm, maybe I should check a calendar or use some method to calculate it. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Let me think. January has 31 days, so January 1 is Saturday. Then February 1 is a Monday (since 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days, so adding 3 days to Saturday gives Tuesday? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again.\n\nWait, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday, and so on. So February 1, 2022, would be 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Saturday (January 1) would be Tuesday. So February 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Then March 1 would be 28 days later (February 2022 is not a leap year, so 28 days). 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So adding 3 days to Tuesday (March 1) would be Friday. So April 1, 2022, was a Friday. Then May 1 is 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Friday (April 1) would be Sunday. So May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. That matches what I thought earlier.\n\nSo May 1 is Sunday. Then the days of the week for May would be:\n\nMay 1: Sunday\n\nMay 2: Monday\n\nMay 3: Tuesday\n\nMay 4: Wednesday\n\nMay 5: Thursday\n\nSo the first Thursday is May 5. Then the next Thursdays would be May 12, 19, 26. Wait, May has 31 days. So the last day of May is May 31. Let's check if May 26 is a Thursday. May 5 is Thursday, then adding 7 days each time. 5 +7=12, 12+7=19, 19+7=26. So May 26 is Thursday. Then the next one would be June 2, but that's outside of May. So the last Thursday in May is May 26. Therefore, the answer should be 26. But wait, let me check again. Because if May 1 is Sunday, then May 5 is Thursday. Then adding 7 days: 5+7=12, 12+7=19, 19+7=26. So yes, May 26 is the last Thursday. Then May 31 is a Tuesday. So the last Thursday is indeed May 26. So the answer is 26. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for May 1. Let me check another way. Maybe using an online calendar or a different method. Alternatively, I can check that May 2022 had its last Thursday on the 26th. Let me think. For example, if I know that May 26, 2022, was a Thursday, then that's correct. Alternatively, if I check the actual calendar, but since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my calculations. So based on the previous steps, May 1 is Sunday, so May 5 is Thursday. Then the next Thursdays are 12, 19, 26. So the last one is 26. Therefore, the answer is 26.", "26"], [124, "Is 2098 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2098 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2098. First, divide 2098 by 4. Let's do the division: 2098 divided by 4. 4 times 524 is 2096, so 2098 minus 2096 is 2. That leaves a remainder of 2, so 2098 is not divisible by 4. Wait, that means it's not a leap year? But maybe I should double-check my math. Let me add 4 to 2096 to get 2100. So 2098 is two years before 2100. So 2098 divided by 4 is 524.5, which is not an integer. So yes, it's not divisible by 4. Therefore, regardless of whether it's a century year, since it's not divisible by 4, it can't be a leap year. \n\nBut wait, is 2098 a century year? Century years are years ending with 00, like 2000, 2100, etc. 2098 ends with 98, so it's not a century year. So even if it were divisible by 4, which it isn't, the century year rule would apply. But since it's not a century year, the only requirement is divisibility by 4. Since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, February 6 to Friday, March 4, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates.\n\nStarting on February 6, 2022. Let me confirm what day that was. Wait, the question says it's a Sunday. So February 6 is a Sunday. Then the next day, February 7 is a Monday. Let me check if that's correct. Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. February 6, 2022: I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So January 1 is Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday. Let me count the days. Let's see, January has 31 days. So February 1, 2022 would be a Monday. Wait, because January 1 is Saturday, so January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday. Then January 31 is a Monday (since 31 days later). Then February 1 is Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday, January 3 is Monday. So January 31 is a Monday (since 31 days later). Then February 1 is Tuesday. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the days. Let me try again.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's check the day of the week for February 6, 2022. If I know that February 6 is a Sunday, then that's given. So the start date is Sunday, February 6. Then the end date is Friday, March 4. So I need to count all the days from Feb 6 to Mar 4, inclusive, and subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can list out the dates and count the weekdays. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many days are between February 6 and March 4, inclusive. Let's calculate the total days.\n\nFebruary has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. So from February 6 to February 28 is 28 - 6 = 22 days, but since we include both start and end dates, it's 22 + 1 = 23 days in February? Wait, no. Wait, if you start on February 6, then the next day is February 7, and so on. So from February 6 to February 28 inclusive is 28 - 6 + 1 = 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total days from Feb 6 to Mar 4 is 23 + 4 = 27 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, let me check again. Let's count the days in February. February 6 to February 28: 28 - 6 = 22 days, but adding 1 for the inclusive count gives 23 days. Then March 1 to March 4 is 4 days. So total is 23 + 4 = 27 days. So total days between Feb 6 and Mar 4 inclusive is 27 days.\n\nNow, out of these 27 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nStarting from Sunday, February 6. So the first day is Sunday. Then the next day is Monday (Feb 7), then Tuesday (Feb 8), Wednesday (Feb 9), Thursday (Feb 10), Friday (Feb 11), Saturday (Feb 12), Sunday (Feb 13), and so on.\n\nSo the weekends in this period would be Sundays and Saturdays. Let's list them.\n\nFirst, the first day is Sunday (Feb 6). Then the next Saturday is Feb 12 (since Feb 6 is Sunday, then Feb 7 is Monday, 8 Tuesday, 9 Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday). Then the next Sunday is Feb 13. Then the next Saturday is Feb 19, Sunday Feb 20, Saturday Feb 26, Sunday March 2. Wait, but the end date is March 4, which is a Friday. So let's check the dates.\n\nLet me list all the dates from Feb 6 to March 4 and note the weekdays.\n\nStarting with Feb 6 (Sunday), Feb 7 (Monday), Feb 8 (Tuesday), Feb 9 (Wednesday), Feb 10 (Thursday), Feb 11 (Friday), Feb 12 (Saturday), Feb 13 (Sunday), Feb 14 (Monday), Feb 15 (Tuesday), Feb 16 (Wednesday), Feb 17 (Thursday), Feb 18 (Friday), Feb 19 (Saturday), Feb 20 (Sunday), Feb 21 (Monday), Feb 22 (Tuesday), Feb 23 (Wednesday), Feb 24 (Thursday), Feb 25 (Friday), Feb 26 (Saturday), Feb 27 (Sunday), Feb 28 (Monday), March 1 (Tuesday), March 2 (Wednesday), March 3 (Thursday), March 4 (Friday).\n\nNow, let's count the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this list.\n\nSaturdays: Feb 12, Feb 19, Feb 26. That's three Saturdays.\n\nSundays: Feb 6, Feb 13, Feb 20, Feb 27. That's four Sundays.\n\nSo total weekends are 3 + 4 = 7 days.\n\nTherefore, the total weekdays would be total days (27) minus weekends (7) = 20 weekdays.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the weekdays directly.\n\nFrom the list above:\n\nFeb 6: Sunday (weekend)\nFeb 7: Monday (weekday)\nFeb 8: Tuesday (weekday)\nFeb 9: Wednesday (weekday)\nFeb 10: Thursday (weekday)\nFeb 11: Friday (weekday)\nFeb 12: Saturday (weekend)\nFeb 13: Sunday (weekend)\nFeb 14: Monday (weekday)\nFeb 15: Tuesday (weekday)\nFeb 16: Wednesday (weekday)\nFeb 17: Thursday (weekday)\nFeb 18: Friday (weekday)\nFeb 19: Saturday (weekend)\nFeb 20: Sunday (weekend)\nFeb 21: Monday (weekday)\nFeb 22: Tuesday (weekday)\nFeb 23: Wednesday (weekday)\nFeb 24: Thursday (weekday)\nFeb 25: Friday (weekday)\nFeb 26: Saturday (weekend)\nFeb 27: Sunday (weekend)\nFeb 28: Monday (weekday)\nMarch 1: Tuesday (weekday)\nMarch 2: Wednesday (weekday)\nMarch 3: Thursday (weekday)\nMarch 4: Friday (weekday)\n\nNow, let's count the weekdays (Monday-Friday):\n\nFeb 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 (5 days)\nFeb 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (5 days)\nFeb 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (5 days)\nFeb 28 (1 day)\nMarch 1, 2, 3, 4 (4 days)\n\nTotal: 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 20 days.\n\nYes, that's 20 weekdays.

I need to find out how many Mondays there are between Sunday, June 12, 2022, and Thursday, July 28, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to just list out the dates or find the first and last day of the week in that range. Let me start by checking what day of the week June 12, 2022, was. The user mentioned it's a Sunday. So June 12 is a Sunday. Then I need to count all the Mondays from that date up to July 28, which is a Thursday.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's start with June 12 (Sunday). The next day, June 13, is a Monday. So that's the first Monday. Then every 7 days after that. Let me figure out how many weeks and extra days there are between June 12 and July 28.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days between June 12 and July 28, inclusive. Wait, but maybe it's easier to calculate the number of days from June 12 to July 28, then see how many Mondays are in that period.\n\nBut maybe I should check the actual dates. Let me think. June has 30 days. So from June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since June 12 is included, it's 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, if I start on June 12 (day 1), then June 13 is day 2, etc. Wait, maybe I should calculate the total days between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the number of weeks and days in the period. Let's see. From June 12 (Sunday) to July 28 (Thursday). Let me count the days step by step.\n\nFirst, June 12 is Sunday. Let's count the days in June after that. June has 30 days. So from June 12 to June 30 is 30 - 12 = 18 days, but since June 12 is included, the total days in June from June 12 to June 30 is 19 days? Wait, no. Wait, if you have June 12 as day 1, then June 13 is day 2, ..., June 30 is day 19. So that's 19 days in June. Then July has 31 days, but we need up to July 28. So July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total days from June 12 to July 28 inclusive is 19 (June) + 28 (July) = 47 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, June 12 to June 30 is 19 days (including both ends). Then July 1 to July 28 is 28 days. So total is 19 + 28 = 47 days. So the total number of days is 47.\n\nNow, since the period starts on a Sunday (June 12), the first day is Sunday, and the last day is Thursday (July 28). So how many Mondays are there in 47 days?\n\nWell, each week has 7 days. So 47 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 5 days. So 6 weeks would have 6 Mondays. Then the remaining 5 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So in those 5 days, there is 1 additional Monday. So total Mondays would be 6 + 1 = 7?\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me list the days. Starting from June 12 (Sunday):\n\nJune 12: Sunday\n\nJune 13: Monday (1st Monday)\n\nJune 20: Monday (2nd)\n\nJune 27: Monday (3rd)\n\nJuly 4: Monday (4th)\n\nJuly 11: Monday (5th)\n\nJuly 18: Monday (6th)\n\nJuly 25: Monday (7th)\n\nThen the next Monday would be August 1, which is outside the range. So that's 7 Mondays. But wait, the last day is July 28, which is a Thursday. So July 25 is a Monday, then July 26 is Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday. So yes, July 25 is the 7th Monday. So that's 7 Mondays in total. So the answer should be 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates. Let me confirm the days. Let me check what day July 28, 2022, was. Wait, the user said it's a Thursday. So that's correct. So from June 12 (Sunday) to July 28 (Thursday), inclusive, there are 47 days. Let me check the number of Mondays again. Let's count them:\n\nJune 13 (Monday), June 20, June 27, July 4, July 11, July 18, July 25. That's 7 Mondays. So yes, 7.

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me start by checking the dates.\n\nJanuary 24, 2022 is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think January 24, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can count the days. But maybe I should just proceed step by step.\n\nSo, from January 24 to March 22. Let's break it down into months. January has 31 days, so from January 24 to January 31 is 8 days (including the 24th). Then February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days.\n\nSo total days would be 8 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 22 (Mar) = 58 days. Wait, but wait, that's from January 24 to March 22 inclusive? Let me check again.\n\nWait, if I start on January 24, that's day 1. Then January 25 is day 2, ..., January 31 is day 8. Then February has 28 days, so that's 28 days. Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. So total days is 8 + 28 + 22 = 58 days. So total days between the two dates inclusive is 58 days.\n\nNow, I need to subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period. But since the start date is a Monday, let's see how the weekends fall.\n\nStarting from January 24 (Monday), the next day is Tuesday, then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo, in each week, there are 2 weekend days. Let's figure out how many full weeks there are in 58 days and then the remaining days.\n\n58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 2 days. Because 8*7=56, so 58-56=2 days remaining.\n\nSo, 8 full weeks would have 8*2=16 weekend days. Then the remaining 2 days are January 24 (Monday) and January 25 (Tuesday). Wait, no. Wait, the total days are 58. Wait, if there are 8 weeks (56 days), then the remaining 2 days would be the 57th and 58th days. But since the first day is Monday, the 57th day would be a Monday (since 56 days is exactly 8 weeks), and the 58th day would be a Tuesday. So the remaining two days are Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, there are no weekend days in the remaining two days. So total weekend days would be 16.\n\nTherefore, the number of business days would be total days (58) minus weekend days (16) = 42 business days.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because maybe my calculation of the total days is wrong. Let me verify the dates again.\n\nJanuary 24, 2022 is a Monday. Let me check the dates step by step.\n\nJanuary 24 (Monday), 25 (Tue), 26 (Wed), 27 (Thu), 28 (Fri), 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun), 31 (Mon). So from Jan 24 to Jan 31 is 8 days. Then February has 28 days. So from Feb 1 to Feb 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 22 is 22 days. So total days is 8 + 28 + 22 = 58. That's correct.\n\nNow, the weekends in January: Jan 29 (Sat), 30 (Sun). Then in February, each week has two weekends. February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks. So 4 weeks * 2 = 8 weekend days. Then March: March 1 is a Tuesday (since Feb 28 is a Monday, so March 1 is Tuesday). Then March 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), etc. So March 5 is Saturday, 6 is Sunday. Then March 10 is Saturday, 11 Sunday, 17 Saturday, 18 Sunday, 24 Saturday, 25 Sunday. Wait, but March 22 is the end date. So March 22 is a Tuesday. Let me check that.\n\nWait, March 1 is a Tuesday. So March 1 (Tue), 2 (Wed), 3 (Thu), 4 (Fri), 5 (Sat), 6 (Sun), 7 (Mon), 8 (Tue), 9 (Wed), 10 (Thu), 11 (Fri), 12 (Sat), 13 (Sun), 14 (Mon), 15 (Tue), 16 (Wed), 17 (Thu), 18 (Fri), 19 (Sat), 20 (Sun), 21 (Mon), 22 (Tue). So March 22 is a Tuesday. So in March, the weekends are March 5, 6; 12, 13; 19, 20. That's three weekends. So that's 3*2=6 weekend days in March.\n\nSo total weekends: January (2) + February (8) + March (6) = 16. So that matches the previous calculation. So total business days would be 58 - 16 = 42.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because in January, the weekends are 29 (Sat) and 30 (Sun). That's 2 days. February has 4 weeks, so 8 days. March has 3 weekends (5-6, 12-13, 19-20), which is 6 days. So total 2+8+6=16. So 58-16=42. So the answer should be 42.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check another way. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from January 24 (Monday) to March 22 (Tuesday). Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays in that period.\n\nAlternatively, since the first day is Monday, and the last day is Tuesday, and there are 58 days total.\n\nEach week has 5 business days. So 8 weeks would be 40 business days. Then the remaining 2 days are Monday and Tuesday, which are both business days. So 40 + 2 = 42. That matches the previous result.

Hmm, first, I should figure out the date 99 days later, then determine the weekday.\n\nStarting with December 26, 2022, which is a Monday. Let me count forward 99 days. But maybe there's a smarter way than counting each day. I remember that weeks have 7 days, so 99 divided by 7 will tell me how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that division.\n\n99 divided by 7 is 14 weeks with a remainder of 1 day. Because 14 times 7 is 98, so 99 minus 98 is 1. So that means 99 days later is 14 weeks and 1 day. Since the original day is Monday, adding 1 day would make it Tuesday. Wait, but is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the date calculation is right. Let me verify. Let's count the days step by step. Starting from December 26, 2022. Let's add 99 days. But maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the date. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're starting in December, maybe the next year's dates are needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that here, I need to calculate manually. Let's try adding months and days.\n\nDecember has 31 days. So December 26 plus 4 days is December 30 (26+4=30). Then 31-26=5 days left in December. Wait, maybe breaking it down into months would help. Let's see:\n\nFrom December 26, 2022, adding 99 days. Let's first add 31 days to get to January 25, 2023 (since December has 31 days). Then 31 days later is January 25, 2023. Then adding another 31 days would be February 24, 2023. Then adding another 31 days would be March 23, 2023. Wait, but 31 + 31 + 31 is 93 days. So 99 days would be 6 more days. So March 23 plus 6 days is March 29, 2023. Wait, but that's 93 + 6 = 99 days. So the date would be March 29, 2023. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check again. Starting from December 26, 2022:\n\nDecember has 31 days. So from December 26 to December 31 is 5 days (26th to 31st inclusive? Wait, no. If I start on the 26th, then adding 1 day is 27th, so 26th to 31st is 5 days later. Wait, maybe I should count the days between dates properly. Let me think. If I add 99 days, maybe it's easier to use the fact that 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. So if the starting day is Monday, adding 14 weeks (98 days) would still be Monday. Then adding 1 more day would be Tuesday. So the answer would be Tuesday. But wait, is that correct? Because if the date is 99 days later, but the day of the week is only shifted by 1 day, then the answer is Tuesday. But maybe I need to check if the date calculation is correct. Because if the date is March 29, 2023, what day is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual day of the week for December 26, 2022. Wait, the user said it's a Monday. So if I add 99 days, which is 14 weeks and 1 day, then the day should be Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday. But maybe I should verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's count the days step by step. Starting from December 26, 2022:\n\nDecember 26 (Monday) + 1 day = December 27 (Tuesday)\n+2 = Dec 28 (Wed)\n+3 = Dec 29 (Thu)\n+4 = Dec 30 (Fri)\n+5 = Dec 31 (Sat)\nThen January 1, 2023 is Sunday. Then January has 31 days. So adding 31 days would be January 31, 2023. Then adding 31 days would be February 28, 2023 (since 2023 is not a leap year). Then adding 31 days would be March 28, 2023. Wait, but that's 31 + 31 + 31 = 93 days. So 99 days would be 6 more days. March 28 + 6 days is April 3, 2023? Wait, that doesn't match my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I messed up the months.\n\nWait, starting from December 26, 2022:\n\nDecember has 31 days. So from Dec 26 to Dec 31 is 5 days (Dec 26 is day 0, then 27 is +1, etc. So Dec 31 is +5 days. Then January has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to January 31 (2023). Then adding another 31 days would take us to February 28 (2023). Then adding another 31 days would take us to March 28 (2023). Wait, but that's 5 + 31 + 31 + 31 = 98 days. Wait, but 99 days would be 98 + 1 day. So March 28 + 1 day is March 29, 2023. So that's 99 days from Dec 26. So March 29, 2023. Now, what day is that?\n\nBut how do I find the day of the week for March 29, 2023? Well, if I know that December 26, 2022 is a Monday, then adding 99 days (which is 14 weeks and 1 day) would make it Tuesday. So that's the answer. But maybe I should check with another method. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the day of the week for March 29, 2023. Let's think about known dates. For example, January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Then January 1 is Sunday. Let's count the days from January 1 to March 29.\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (2023 is not a leap year), so February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days from January 1 to March 29 is 31 + 28 + 29 = 88 days. Wait, but that's from January 1 to March 29. But January 1 is Sunday. So 88 days later would be what day?\n\n88 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 4 days. So Sunday + 4 days is Thursday. Wait, but that would mean March 29, 2023 is a Thursday? But that contradicts the previous conclusion of Tuesday. So there's a problem here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. If December 26, 2022 is Monday, then adding 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day, so Tuesday. But according to the other method, March 29, 2023 is Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me check the number of days from December 26, 2022 to March 29, 2023. Let's count:\n\nDecember 26 to December 31: 5 days (including Dec 26? Or not? Wait, if you start on Dec 26, then adding 1 day is Dec 27. So from Dec 26 to Dec 31 is 5 days (Dec 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31? Wait, that's 6 days. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. Let me count the days between two dates. The number of days between Dec 26 and Dec 31 inclusive is 6 days. But if I'm counting the days after Dec 26, then Dec 27 is +1 day, Dec 28 is +2, etc. So Dec 26 to Dec 31 is 5 days later. Then January has 31 days, so adding 31 days would be Jan 31. Then adding 28 days (February) would be March 28. Then adding 1 day would be March 29. So total days from Dec 26 to March 29 is 5 + 31 + 28 + 1 = 65 days? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, Dec 26 to Dec 31 is 5 days (Dec 27 to Dec 31 is 5 days). Then adding 31 days (January) would be 5 + 31 = 36 days. Then adding 28 days (February) would be 36 + 28 = 64 days. Then adding 1 day (March 29) would be 65 days. But that's only 65 days. But the user said 99 days. So there's a mistake here. So my previous calculation was wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I messed up the initial breakdown. Let me try again. Let's count the days from Dec 26, 2022, to March 29, 2023.\n\nFirst, December has 31 days. So from Dec 26 to Dec 31 is 31 - 26 = 5 days. Wait, but if you start on Dec 26, then Dec 26 is day 0. Dec 27 is +1, Dec 28 is +2, Dec 29 is +3, Dec 30 is +4, Dec 31 is +5. So that's 5 days. Then January has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to Jan 31 (2023), which is 5 + 31 = 36 days from Dec 26. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days would take us to March 28 (2023), which is 36 + 28 = 64 days. Then March 29 is 1 day after March 28, so total days is 64 + 1 = 65 days. But that's only 65 days. But the user asked for 99 days. So clearly, my previous calculation was wrong. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe I need to add more months. Let's see. After March 28, 2023, adding 31 days would take us to April 28, 2023. But that's 31 days. Wait, but 64 + 31 = 95 days. Then adding 4 more days would be 99 days. So March 28 + 4 days is April 1 (March 28 + 1 is March 29, +2 is April 1? Wait, no. March 28 + 1 day is March 29, +2 is March 30, +3 is March 31, +4 is April 1. So 64 + 4 = 68 days. Wait, that's not matching. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. So if the starting day is Monday, adding 14 weeks (98 days) would still be Monday. Then adding 1 more day would be Tuesday. So the answer is Tuesday. But why does the other method give a different result? Because I must have miscalculated the number of days between the dates. Let me check with another approach.\n\nLet me use an online date calculator. Wait, I can't do that, but maybe I can use known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Let's check that. If December 26, 2022 is a Monday, then December 27 is Tuesday, and so on. Let's count the days from December 26 to January 1, 2023. December 26 is day 0 (Monday). December 27 is +1 (Tuesday), ..., December 31 is +5 (Saturday). Then January 1 is +6 (Sunday). So that's correct. So January 1, 2023 is Sunday. Then January has 31 days, so January 1 is Sunday, January 8 is Sunday, etc. So January 31 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Sunday + 3 days is Wednesday. So January 31, 2023 is a Wednesday. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is 28 days later. 28 days is 4 weeks, so same day as January 31, which is Wednesday. So February 28 is Wednesday. Then March 1 is Thursday. March 1 is Thursday. Then March 8 is Thursday, March 15 is Thursday, March 22 is Thursday, March 29 is Thursday. So March 29, 2023 is a Thursday. But according to the previous calculation, adding 99 days from Monday should be Tuesday. But here, March 29 is Thursday. So there's a contradiction. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial assumption that 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day is wrong. Because if 99 days later is Thursday, then the difference between Monday and Thursday is 3 days, not 1. So that would mean that 99 days is 14 weeks and 3 days. But 14*7 is 98, so 98 + 3 = 101 days. Wait, that's not matching. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the assumption that 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. Let me check that again. 99 divided by 7 is 14.142... So 14*7 is 98, remainder 1. So 99 days is 14 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Monday should be Tuesday. But according to the date calculation, March 29 is Thursday. So there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption that December 26, 2022 is a Monday is incorrect. Wait, the user said that it is. Let me check that. Let me recall that December 26, 2022 was indeed a Monday. For example, I can check online, but since I can't, I have to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. December 26, 2022: if I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday, then December 26 is Monday. But how do I know that? Well, if I remember that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday, then that's correct. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's check the day of the week for January 1, 2023, which I said was Sunday. If that's correct, then December 26, 2022 is 6 days before January 1, 2023. So December 26 is 6 days before Sunday. So Sunday minus 6 days is Monday. So that's correct. So December 26, 2022 is Monday. Then adding 99 days should be Tuesday. But according to the date calculation, March 29 is Thursday. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the date calculation. Let me recheck the days from December 26, 2022 to March 29, 2023. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nFrom December 26, 2022 (Monday) to December 31, 2022: 5 days (Dec 27 to Dec 31). So that's 5 days later. Then January 2023: 31 days. So from Dec 31 to Jan 31 is 31 days. Then February 2023: 28 days. Then March 2023: up to March 29. So total days from Dec 26 to March 29 is 5 (Dec) + 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 29 (Mar) = 5 + 31"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Thursday, September 15 to Saturday, November 26, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Express your answer as a number.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between Thursday, September 15 and Saturday, November 26, 2022, including both dates. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. September 15 is a Thursday. Then November 26 is a Saturday. Let me confirm the dates. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. Let me check the days of the week for each month.\n\nFirst, September 15 is a Thursday. Let's count the days from September 15 to November 26.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So from September 15 to September 30 is 16 days (including both start and end). Wait, September 15 is day 1, then September 16 is day 2, etc. So from September 15 to September 30 is 30 - 15 + 1 = 16 days. But wait, September 15 is included, so that's correct.\n\nThen October has 31 days. November has 30 days, so up to November 26 is 26 days. So total days from September 15 to November 26 is 16 (September) + 31 (October) + 26 (November) = 16 + 31 is 47, plus 26 is 73 days total. Wait, but that's including both start and end dates. Let me check that again. Wait, September 15 to September 30 is 16 days. Then October is 31 days, so adding that gives 16 + 31 = 47 days up to October 31. Then November 1 to November 26 is 26 days. So total is 47 + 26 = 73 days. So total days between September 15 and November 26 inclusive is 73 days.\n\nNow, I need to find how many of those are weekdays. Let's think about how many weekends are in that period. Since September 15 is a Thursday, the next day is Friday (Sep 16), then Saturday (Sep 17), Sunday (Sep 18), then Monday (Sep 19), etc.\n\nSo the first week starts on Thursday, September 15. Let's count the weekends in each month.\n\nFirst, September: From September 15 (Thursday) to September 30. Let's list the weekends in September. The first weekend would be September 17 (Saturday) and 18 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is September 24 (Saturday) and 25 (Sunday). Then September 30 is a Saturday? Wait, let me check. Wait, September 15 is Thursday. Let's count the days:\n\nSeptember 15: Thu\n16: Fri\n17: Sat\n18: Sun\n19: Mon\n20: Tue\n21: Wed\n22: Thu\n23: Fri\n24: Sat\n25: Sun\n26: Mon\n27: Tue\n28: Wed\n29: Thu\n30: Fri\n\nWait, so September 30 is a Friday. So in September, the weekends are 17-18, 24-25. That's 2 weekends, 4 days. So 4 weekend days in September.\n\nThen October has 31 days. Let's check the weekends in October. October 1 is a Saturday (since September 30 is Friday, so October 1 is Saturday). Wait, September 30 is Friday, so October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday, 2 is Sunday. Then the next weekend is October 8 (Sat), 9 (Sun), then 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, 30. Wait, October has 31 days, so the last weekend is October 30 (Sat) and 31 (Sun). Wait, but October 31 is a Sunday. So in October, the weekends are:\n\nWeekends in October: 1-2, 8-9, 15-16, 22-23, 29-30. That's 5 weekends, 10 days.\n\nThen November. November 1 is a Monday (since October 31 is Sunday). So November 1 is Monday. Then the weekends in November would be 3 (Sat), 4 (Sun), 10 (Sat), 11 (Sun), 17 (Sat), 18 (Sun), 24 (Sat), 25 (Sun). But the end date is November 26, which is a Saturday. So the weekends in November up to November 26 are:\n\nNovember 3-4, 10-11, 17-18, 24-25. Then November 26 is a Saturday, which is included. So that's 4 weekends (each weekend is 2 days) plus November 26. Wait, but November 26 is a Saturday, which is a weekend. So the weekends in November are:\n\n3-4, 10-11, 17-18, 24-25, and 26 (since the end date is Saturday, November 26). Wait, but November 26 is a Saturday, so that's one day. Wait, but the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. So if the end date is Saturday, then the weekend days in November would be 3-4, 10-11, 17-18, 24-25, and 26 (Saturday). But that's 4 weekends (each 2 days) plus one day (Saturday). Wait, but that would be 4*2 +1 = 9 days? Wait, but that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, November 1 is Monday. So November 3 is Saturday (since 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, 3 is Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, November 1 is Monday. Then November 2 is Tuesday, 3 is Wednesday, 4 is Thursday, 5 is Friday, 6 is Saturday. Wait, that's not right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nIf October 31 is Sunday, then November 1 is Monday. So November 1 is Monday. Then November 2 is Tuesday, 3 is Wednesday, 4 is Thursday, 5 is Friday, 6 is Saturday. So the first weekend in November is Saturday the 6th and Sunday the 7th. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So I must have made a mistake in the previous calculation.\n\nWait, this is critical. Let me re-examine the dates.\n\nSeptember 30 is Friday. October 1 is Saturday. October 2 is Sunday. Then October 3 is Monday. October 4 is Tuesday, etc. So October 31 is a Sunday. Then November 1 is Monday. So November 1 is Monday. Then November 2 is Tuesday, 3 is Wednesday, 4 is Thursday, 5 is Friday, 6 is Saturday. So the first weekend in November is Saturday the 6th and Sunday the 7th. Then the next weekend is 13-14, 20-21, 27-28. Then November 26 is Saturday, which is part of the weekend. Wait, November 26 is Saturday, and November 27 is Sunday. But the end date is November 26, so that's only Saturday. So the weekends in November would be:\n\nWeekends in November: 6-7, 13-14, 20-21, 27-28. But since the end date is November 26, which is Saturday, the last weekend is 26 (Saturday) and 27 (Sunday). But since the end date is 26, only Saturday is included. So the weekends in November are 6-7, 13-14, 20-21, and 26 (Saturday). Wait, but 27 is not included. So that's 3 full weekends (each 2 days) plus one day (Saturday). So that's 3*2 +1 = 7 days of weekends in November.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting with the previous thought. Let me check again. Let's list the dates:\n\nNovember 1: Monday\nNovember 2: Tuesday\nNovember 3: Wednesday\nNovember 4: Thursday\nNovember 5: Friday\nNovember 6: Saturday\nNovember 7: Sunday\nNovember 8: Monday\n... and so on.\n\nSo the first weekend is 6-7 (Saturday and Sunday). Then the next is 13-14, then 20-21, then 27-28. But the end date is November 26, which is Saturday. So the last weekend in the period is 26 (Saturday) and 27 (Sunday). But since the end date is 26, only Saturday is included. So in November, the weekends are 6-7, 13-14, 20-21, and 26 (Saturday). That's 3 full weekends (each 2 days) plus one day (Saturday). So total of 3*2 +1 = 7 days of weekends in November.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period:\n\nSeptember: 4 days (2 weekends)\nOctober: 10 days (5 weekends)\nNovember: 7 days (3 full weekends + 1 day)\nTotal weekends: 4 + 10 + 7 = 21 days.\n\nWait, but wait, in September, the weekends were 17-18 (2 days), 24-25 (2 days), that's 4 days. Correct. October had 5 weekends, each 2 days, so 10 days. November had 3 weekends (each 2 days) plus one day (Saturday), so 7 days. So total 4+10+7=21 days of weekends.\n\nTotal days from September 15 to November 26 inclusive is 73 days. So the number of weekdays would be 73 - 21 = 52 days. But wait, let me check that again. Because if there are 21 weekend days, then 73 - 21 = 52 weekdays. But let me verify this with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since September 15 is a Thursday, let's count the number of weekdays in each month.\n\nSeptember: From September 15 (Thursday) to September 30 (Friday). Let's count the weekdays. The days are:\n\nThursday (15), Friday (16), Saturday (17), Sunday (18), Monday (19), Tuesday (20), Wednesday (21), Thursday (22), Friday (22?), wait, no. Wait, September 15 is Thursday. So the days in September from 15 to 30:\n\n15: Thu\n16: Fri\n17: Sat\n18: Sun\n19: Mon\n20: Tue\n21: Wed\n22: Thu\n23: Fri\n24: Sat\n25: Sun\n26: Mon\n27: Tue\n28: Wed\n29: Thu\n30: Fri\n\nSo from 15 to 30, that's 16 days. The weekdays are Thursday (15), Friday (16), Monday (19), Tuesday (20), Wednesday (21), Thursday (22), Friday (23), Monday (26), Tuesday (27), Wednesday (28), Thursday (29), Friday (30). Let's count them:\n\nThu (15), Fri (16) \u2192 2\nMon (19), Tue (20), Wed (21) \u2192 3\nThu (22), Fri (23) \u2192 2\nMon (26), Tue (27), Wed (28) \u2192 3\nThu (29), Fri (30) \u2192 2\nTotal: 2+3+2+3+2 = 12 weekdays in September.\n\nWait, but that's 12 weekdays. But according to the previous calculation, total days in September is 16, and weekends are 4 days (so 16-4=12 weekdays). Correct. So that's 12 weekdays in September.\n\nOctober has 31 days. Let's count the weekdays. October 1 is Saturday. So the days of the week for October:\n\nOctober 1: Saturday\n2: Sunday\n3: Monday\n4: Tuesday\n5: Wednesday\n6: Thursday\n7: Friday\n8: Saturday\n9: Sunday\n10: Monday\n11: Tuesday\n12: Wednesday\n13: Thursday\n14: Friday\n15: Saturday\n16: Sunday\n17: Monday\n18: Tuesday\n19: Wednesday\n20: Thursday\n21: Friday\n22: Saturday\n23: Sunday\n24: Monday\n25: Tuesday\n26: Wednesday\n27: Thursday\n28: Friday\n29: Saturday\n30: Sunday\n31: Monday\n\nSo from October 1 to October 31, the weekdays are Monday to Friday. Let's count the number of weekdays in October. Since October has 31 days, and the first day is Saturday, the number of weekdays can be calculated as follows. Each week has 5 weekdays. Let's see how many full weeks there are. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks have 4*5=20 weekdays, plus the remaining 3 days (October 29, 30, 31) which are Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So only Monday is a weekday. So total weekdays in October is 20 +1 = 21.\n\nWait, but wait, October 1 is Saturday. So the first week (October 1-7) has 2 weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday). Wait, no. Wait, October 1 is Saturday, so the first week (October 1-7) includes Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So the weekdays are Monday (3), Tuesday (4), Wednesday (5), Thursday (6), Friday (7). That's 5 weekdays. Then the next week (October 8-14) is Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Again 5 weekdays. Similarly for weeks 15-21, 22-28, 29-31. Wait, October 29 is Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So the last week has 3 days: Saturday, Sunday, Monday. So the weekdays in that week are Monday. So total weeks: 4 full weeks (each 5 weekdays) and 3 days with 1 weekday. So 4*5 +1 = 21 weekdays. Correct. So October has 21 weekdays.\n\nThen November. November 1 is Monday. The end date is November 26, which is Saturday. So November has 26 days. Let's count the weekdays in November from 1 to 26.\n\nNovember 1 is Monday. Let's list the days:\n\nNovember 1: Monday\n2: Tuesday\n3: Wednesday\n4: Thursday\n5: Friday\n6: Saturday\n7: Sunday\n8: Monday\n9: Tuesday\n10: Wednesday\n11: Thursday\n12: Friday\n13: Saturday\n14: Sunday\n15: Monday\n16: Tuesday\n17: Wednesday\n18: Thursday\n19: Friday\n20: Saturday\n21: Sunday\n22: Monday\n23: Tuesday\n24: Wednesday\n25: Thursday\n26: Friday\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, November 1 is Monday. Then November 6 is Saturday, 7 Sunday. Then November 13 is Saturday, 14 Sunday. November 20 is Saturday, 21 Sunday. November 27 is Saturday, 28 Sunday. But the end date is November 26, which is Friday. So the days up to November 26 are:\n\nFrom November 1 to November 26. Let's count the weekdays. Let's see:\n\nEach week has 5 weekdays. November has 26 days. Let's see how many full weeks and extra days. 26 days is 3 weeks (21 days) and 5 days. So 3 weeks have 3*5=15 weekdays. The remaining 5 days are November 22 (Monday), 23 (Tuesday), 24 (Wednesday), 25 (Thursday), 26 (Friday). All of these are weekdays. So total weekdays in November is 15 +5=20.\n\nWait, but according to the previous calculation, the weekends in November were 7 days. So total days in November is 26. 26 -7=19 weekdays. But this contradicts the current count. Wait, there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if November 1 is Monday, then November 26 is Friday. Let's count the number of weekdays in November from 1 to 26.\n\nLet me list the days:\n\nWeek 1: 1 (Mon) to 7 (Sun)\nWeek 2: 8 (Mon) to 14 (Sun)\nWeek 3: 15 (Mon) to 21 (Sun)\nWeek 4: 22 (Mon) to 28 (Sun)\nBut we only go up to 26, which is Friday of week 4.\n\nSo in week 1: Mon (1), Tue (2), Wed ("], [124, "Is 2055 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2055 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 2055. First, divide 2055 by 4. Let's do the division: 2055 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2055 minus 2000 is 55. 55 divided by 4 is 13.75. So 2055 divided by 4 is 513.75. That means 2055 is not divisible by 4 because there's a remainder. Wait, but maybe I should check more carefully. Let me add 4 to 2055: 2055 + 4 = 2059. So 2055 is not a multiple of 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, since it's not divisible by 4, it can't be a leap year. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me confirm. 2055 divided by 4: 4 times 513 is 2052. 2055 minus 2052 is 3. So yes, remainder 3. So definitely not divisible by 4. Therefore, regardless of whether it's a century year or not, since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. \n\nWait, but 2055 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So even if it were divisible by 4, but since it's not a century year, the second condition (divisible by 400) wouldn't apply. But since it's not divisible by 4 at all, the first condition fails. So the answer should be no.", "No"], [124, "Count forward 46 days from Wednesday, February 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 46 days after Wednesday, February 2, 2022. Hmm, so first, I should figure out the date 46 days later, and then determine the weekday.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to calculate the weekday without knowing the exact date? Because adding days can be done by considering how many weeks and extra days there are. Since a week has 7 days, 46 divided by 7 gives 6 weeks and 4 days. So if I start on a Wednesday, adding 6 weeks would still be Wednesday, and then adding 4 more days would take me to Sunday. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, let me check. Let's break it down. 46 divided by 7 is 6 with a remainder of 4. So 6 weeks is 42 days, and then 4 more days. So starting from Wednesday, adding 4 days: Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this by checking the actual dates. Let me try to count the days step by step. Starting from February 2, 2022, which is a Wednesday. Let's count 46 days forward.\n\nFirst, February 2022: February has 28 days in 2022 because it's not a leap year. So from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since 28 - 2 = 26). Wait, no, if I start on February 2, then adding 26 days would take me to February 28. But that's 26 days. Then, March has 31 days, April has 30, May 31, etc. But maybe I should just count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from Wednesday, February 2, 2022. Let's add 46 days. Let's break it into weeks and days. 46 divided by 7 is 6 weeks (42 days) and 4 days. So adding 42 days would bring me back to the same day of the week, Wednesday. Then adding 4 more days: Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday, +3 is Saturday, +4 is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if the 46 days include the starting day or not. Wait, when you count forward, the starting day is day 0. So adding 46 days would be 46 days later. So if I add 42 days (6 weeks), that's still the same day, Wednesday. Then adding 4 days: Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4). So yes, Sunday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual date. Let's see. February 2, 2022, plus 46 days. Let's count:\n\nFebruary has 28 days, so from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since 28 - 2 = 26). Then March has 31 days. So adding 26 days gets me to February 28. Then adding 20 more days (since 46 - 26 = 20) would take me to March 20, 2022. Wait, 26 days from February 2 is February 28. Then adding 20 days: March 1 is day 27, March 2 is 28, ..., March 20 is 26 + 20 = 46 days. So March 20, 2022. Now, what day of the week is March 20, 2022?\n\nWait, I need to check that. But how? Well, if February 2 is a Wednesday, then February 28 is 26 days later. 26 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 5 days. So adding 3 weeks (21 days) would be Wednesday again, then 5 more days: Thursday (22), Friday (23), Saturday (24), Sunday (25), Monday (26). Wait, so February 28 would be a Monday? Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, starting from Wednesday, February 2. Adding 7 days is February 9, which is also Wednesday. Then 14 days is February 16, Wednesday again. 21 days is February 23, Wednesday. Then 28 days would be March 3, which is Wednesday again. Wait, but that's 28 days from February 2. Wait, but February has 28 days, so February 2 + 28 days is March 1, 2022. Wait, that's 28 days later. So March 1 is a Wednesday. Then March 2 is Thursday, March 3 is Friday, March 4 is Saturday, March 5 is Sunday, March 6 is Monday, March 7 is Tuesday, March 8 is Wednesday, etc.\n\nWait, so if March 1 is Wednesday, then March 20 would be 19 days later. Let's count 19 days from March 1. 14 days is 2 weeks, so March 15 is Wednesday. Then 5 more days: March 16 (Thursday), 17 (Friday), 18 (Saturday), 19 (Sunday), 20 (Monday). Wait, so March 20 would be a Monday? But that contradicts the earlier calculation where adding 46 days would be Sunday. So there's a mistake here. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that adding 42 days (6 weeks) would bring me back to Wednesday is wrong. Because if February 2 is Wednesday, then adding 28 days (4 weeks) would be March 1, which is Wednesday. Then adding another 28 days (another 4 weeks) would be March 29, which is Wednesday again. Wait, but 28 + 28 is 56 days. But we need 46 days. So 46 days is 42 days (6 weeks) plus 4 days. So 42 days from February 2 is March 29? Wait, no. Wait, 28 days is March 1. Then 28 days after that is March 29. So 28 + 28 = 56 days. So 42 days would be 28 + 14 days. 28 days is March 1, then 14 days later is March 15. So March 15 is 42 days after February 2. Then adding 4 more days would be March 19 (Thursday), March 20 (Friday), March 21 (Saturday), March 22 (Sunday). Wait, but that's 4 days after March 15. So March 15 is Wednesday, then March 16 is Thursday, 17 Friday, 18 Saturday, 19 Sunday. Wait, so adding 4 days to March 15 (Wednesday) would be Sunday. So March 19 is Sunday. But earlier when I tried to count March 20 as Monday, that was a mistake. Wait, maybe I messed up the days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual date. Let me try to find the correct day for March 20, 2022. Let's check online... Well, I can't do that, but I can use another method. Let's check the day of the week for March 1, 2022. If February 2 is Wednesday, then March 1 is 28 days later. 28 days is exactly 4 weeks, so March 1 is also a Wednesday. Then March 8 is Wednesday, March 15 is Wednesday, March 22 is Wednesday, and March 29 is Wednesday. So March 20 would be 19 days after March 1. Let's count: March 1 (Wednesday), March 8 (Wednesday), March 15 (Wednesday), March 22 (Wednesday). So March 15 is Wednesday. Then March 16 is Thursday, 17 Friday, 18 Saturday, 19 Sunday, 20 Monday. Wait, so March 20 is Monday. But according to the previous calculation, adding 46 days to February 2 would be March 20, which is Monday. But earlier I thought that adding 4 days to Wednesday would be Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, the initial assumption that 46 days is 6 weeks (42 days) plus 4 days is correct. But if 42 days later is March 15 (Wednesday), then adding 4 days would be March 19 (Sunday). But according to the other calculation, March 20 is Monday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between February 2 and March 15. Let's count the days from February 2 to March 15. February has 28 days, so from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days. Then March 1 to March 15 is 15 days. So total is 26 + 15 = 41 days. Wait, that's 41 days. But 42 days would be March 16. Wait, so maybe I miscalculated earlier. Let me check again.\n\nIf February 2 is day 0 (Wednesday), then February 2 + 28 days is March 1 (Wednesday). Then March 1 + 14 days is March 15 (Wednesday). So that's 28 + 14 = 42 days. So March 15 is 42 days after February 2. Then adding 4 more days would be March 19 (Thursday), March 20 (Friday), March 21 (Saturday), March 22 (Sunday). Wait, so March 19 is Sunday. But earlier when I counted March 20 as Monday, that was wrong. Because March 15 is Wednesday, March 16 is Thursday, 17 Friday, 18 Saturday, 19 Sunday, 20 Monday. So March 20 is Monday. But according to the 46 days calculation, 42 + 4 = 46 days would be March 19 (Sunday) + 1 day (March 20) is Monday. Wait, so that's correct. So the 46 days from February 2 is March 20, which is Monday. But according to the initial calculation of adding 4 days to Wednesday (Wednesday + 4 days is Sunday), that's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! The mistake is in the initial assumption that adding 42 days (6 weeks) would bring me back to Wednesday. But if 28 days later is March 1 (Wednesday), then 42 days later is March 15 (Wednesday). So that's correct. Then adding 4 days to March 15 (Wednesday) would be March 19 (Sunday). But March 20 is one day after that, which is Monday. So the 46 days from February 2 is March 20, which is Monday. Therefore, the correct answer should be Monday. But why does the initial calculation of adding 4 days to Wednesday (Wednesday + 4 days = Sunday) not match?\n\nBecause the 46 days is 42 days (6 weeks) plus 4 days. But 42 days later is March 15 (Wednesday), then adding 4 days would be March 19 (Sunday). But that's only 42 + 4 = 46 days. Wait, but March 19 is 46 days after February 2? Let me check the days again. From February 2 to March 15 is 42 days. Then March 15 + 4 days is March 19. So March 19 is 46 days after February 2. But earlier when I thought that March 20 is 46 days, that was wrong. So where did I go wrong in the previous calculation?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the earlier step where I thought that adding 26 days (from February 2 to February 28) and then 20 days (to March 20) would be 46 days. But that's incorrect. Because from February 2 to February 28 is 26 days (since 28 - 2 = 26). Then adding 20 days to February 28 would be March 18 (28 + 20 = 48 days). Wait, no. Wait, February 28 is day 26. Then adding 20 days would be day 26 + 20 = 46 days. So that would be March 18? Wait, no. Because February 28 is day 26. Then March 1 is day 27, March 2 is 28, ..., March 18 is 26 + 18 = 44 days. Wait, that's not right. Wait, if February 2 is day 0, then February 28 is day 26. Then March 1 is day 27, March 2 is 28, ..., March 18 is day 27 + 17 = 44. Then March 19 is 45, March 20 is 46. So March 20 is day 46. So that's correct. So March 20 is 46 days after February 2. But according to the other calculation, March 19 is 46 days. That's conflicting. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me count the days step by step. Let's start from February 2, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count 46 days:\n\nDay 0: Feb 2 (Wed)\nDay 1: Feb 3 (Thu)\nDay 2: Feb 4 (Fri)\nDay 3: Feb 5 (Sat)\nDay 4: Feb 6 (Sun)\nDay 5: Feb 7 (Mon)\nDay 6: Feb 8 (Tue)\nDay 7: Feb 9 (Wed)\nDay 8: Feb 10 (Thu)\nDay 9: Feb 11 (Fri)\nDay 10: Feb 12 (Sat)\nDay 11: Feb 13 (Sun)\nDay 12: Feb 14 (Mon)\nDay 13: Feb 15 (Tue)\nDay 14: Feb 16 (Wed)\nDay 15: Feb 17 (Thu)\nDay 16: Feb 18 (Fri)\nDay 17: Feb 19 (Sat)\nDay 18: Feb 20 (Sun)\nDay 19: Feb 21 (Mon)\nDay 20: Feb 22 (Tue)\nDay 21: Feb 23 (Wed)\nDay 22: Feb 24 (Thu)\nDay 23: Feb 25 (Fri)\nDay 24: Feb 26 (Sat)\nDay 25: Feb 27 (Sun)\nDay 26: Feb 28 (Mon)\nDay 27: Mar 1 (Tue)\nDay 28: Mar 2 (Wed)\nDay 29: Mar 3 (Thu)\nDay 30: Mar 4 (Fri)\nDay 31: Mar 5 (Sat)\nDay 32: Mar 6 (Sun)\nDay 33: Mar 7 (Mon)\nDay 34: Mar 8 (Tue)\nDay 35: Mar 9 (Wed)\nDay 36: Mar 10 (Thu)\nDay 37: Mar 11 (Fri)\nDay 38: Mar 12 (Sat)\nDay 39: Mar 13 (Sun)\nDay 40: Mar 14 (Mon)\nDay 41: Mar 15 (Tue)\nDay 42: Mar 16 (Wed)\nDay 43: Mar 17 (Thu)\nDay 44: Mar 18 (Fri)\nDay 45: Mar 19 (Sat)\nDay 46: Mar 20 (Sun)\n\nWait, so according to this count, day 46 is March 20, which is Sunday. But earlier when I thought that March 15 is Wednesday (day 42), then adding 4 days would be day 46 (March 20), which is Sunday. So that's correct. But earlier when I thought that March 15 is Wednesday, then March 16 is Thursday, 17 Friday, 18 Saturday, 19 Sunday, 20 Monday, that was wrong. Because according to this count, March 15 is Tuesday (day 41), March 16 is Wednesday (day 42), March 17 is Thursday (43), March 18 is Friday (44), March 19 is Saturday (45), March 20 is Sunday (46). So that's correct. So the mistake was in the previous calculation where I thought March 15 was Wednesday. It's actually Tuesday. So the correct answer is Sunday.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Sunday. So the initial calculation was correct. The confusion came from miscalculating the day of the week for March 15. So the correct answer is Sunday.", "Sunday"], [124, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, December 4, 2022, to Saturday, January 14, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check the dates. Wait, the start date is Sunday, December 4, 2022, and the end date is Saturday, January 14, 2022. Wait, but January 14 is after December 4, so the period is from December 4 to January 14. But wait, the user said \"from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)\". So I need to count all the days between those two dates, including both, and then subtract the weekends.\n\nBut first, I need to make sure that the dates are correct. Let me check the actual dates. December 4, 2022 is a Sunday. Then, January 14, 2022 is a Saturday. Wait, but wait, 2022 is a non-leap year, so February has 28 days. Let me confirm the dates.\n\nWait, but the start date is December 4, 2022, and the end date is January 14, 2022. Wait, that can't be right. Because December 4 is in December, and January 14 is in January. But if you go from December 4 to January 14, that's a period that spans into the next year. Wait, but the user wrote \"from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022\". So that's correct. But wait, December 4, 2022 is a Sunday. Then, the next day is December 5, 2022, a Monday. Then, the period goes through December, then into January.\n\nBut I need to calculate the total number of days between those two dates, inclusive, and then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between those dates.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates, then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days from December 4, 2022, to January 14, 2022, inclusive.\n\nWait, but wait, December 4 to January 14 is a period that includes December 4 (Sunday) and January 14 (Saturday). Let me check how many days that is.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of days from December 4 to December 31, 2022. Then add the days from January 1 to January 14, 2022.\n\nDecember has 31 days. So from December 4 to December 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. But since we include both start and end dates, wait, if we start on December 4, then the number of days from December 4 to December 31 inclusive is 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days. Wait, because 31 - 4 = 27, plus 1 is 28. So that's 28 days in December.\n\nThen, January 1 to January 14 is 14 days. So total days from December 4 to January 14 inclusive is 28 + 14 = 42 days.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let's count the days between December 4 and January 14. Let's see:\n\nDecember 4 is day 1. Then December 5 is day 2, ..., December 31 is day 28 (since 31 - 4 + 1 = 28). Then January 1 is day 29, January 2 is day 30, ..., January 14 is day 42. So total of 42 days.\n\nSo total days is 42. Now, out of these 42 days, how many are weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?\n\nNow, the start date is Sunday, December 4. So December 4 is a Sunday. Then December 5 is Monday, December 6 is Tuesday, December 7 is Wednesday, December 8 is Thursday, December 9 is Friday, December 10 is Saturday, December 11 is Sunday, and so on.\n\nSo let's list the weekends in this period.\n\nFirst, December 4 is Sunday (included). Then December 11 is Sunday, December 18, 25, and then January 1 is a Saturday (since December 25 is a Sunday, then December 26 is Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday, 31 Saturday. Wait, wait, December 31, 2022 is a Saturday? Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, December 4, 2022 is a Sunday. Let me check the days of the week for December 4, 2022. Let me confirm that. Well, I can check online, but since I can't, I need to calculate it. Let's see. Let's count the days from December 4 to December 11.\n\nDecember 4: Sunday\n\nDecember 5: Monday\n\nDecember 6: Tuesday\n\nDecember 7: Wednesday\n\nDecember 8: Thursday\n\nDecember 9: Friday\n\nDecember 10: Saturday\n\nDecember 11: Sunday\n\nSo December 10 is Saturday, December 11 is Sunday. Then December 12 is Monday, and so on.\n\nSo December 17 is a Saturday (since 10 + 7 = 17). Then December 17 is Saturday, 18 Sunday, 19 Monday, etc.\n\nSo the weekends in December would be:\n\nDecember 4 (Sunday), 11 (Sunday), 18 (Sunday), 25 (Sunday). Then January 1 is a Saturday (since December 25 is Sunday, 26 Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday, 31 Saturday. So December 31 is Saturday. Then January 1 is Sunday? Wait, that can't be. Wait, if December 31 is a Saturday, then January 1 is a Sunday. But the end date is January 14, which is a Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's check again. Let's start from December 4, 2022, which is a Sunday. Let's count the days:\n\nDecember 4: Sunday\n\nDecember 5: Monday\n\nDecember 6: Tuesday\n\nDecember 7: Wednesday\n\nDecember 8: Thursday\n\nDecember 9: Friday\n\nDecember 10: Saturday\n\nDecember 11: Sunday\n\nDecember 12: Monday\n\nDecember 13: Tuesday\n\nDecember 14: Wednesday\n\nDecember 15: Thursday\n\nDecember 16: Friday\n\nDecember 17: Saturday\n\nDecember 18: Sunday\n\nDecember 19: Monday\n\nDecember 20: Tuesday\n\nDecember 21: Wednesday\n\nDecember 22: Thursday\n\nDecember 23: Friday\n\nDecember 24: Saturday\n\nDecember 25: Sunday\n\nDecember 26: Monday\n\nDecember 27: Tuesday\n\nDecember 28: Wednesday\n\nDecember 29: Thursday\n\nDecember 30: Friday\n\nDecember 31: Saturday\n\nSo December 31 is a Saturday. Therefore, January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Wait, but the end date is January 14, 2022. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, the end date is January 14, 2022. But if December 31, 2022 is a Saturday, then January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. But the end date is January 14, 2022. Wait, that's a problem. Because 2022 is the year, so January 14, 2022 is before December 31, 2022. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, December 4, 2022 is in December, and January 14, 2022 is in January. But that would mean that the period is from December 4, 2022 to January 14, 2022, which is a period that includes December 4 to December 31, 2022, and then January 1 to January 14, 2022. But that would be a period that spans into the next year? Wait, no. Wait, December 4, 2022 is in 2022, and January 14, 2022 is in 2022. Wait, but that can't be. Because January is before December. So if you have a date in December and a date in January, the later date is in the next year. Wait, but the user wrote \"from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022\". That would mean that the end date is in the same year as the start date. But that's impossible because January is before December. So there must be a mistake here. Wait, maybe the user made a typo? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the dates.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant from December 4, 2022 to January 14, 2023? Because that would make sense. But the user wrote 2022 for both dates. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the end date to be January 14, 2022, but that would be earlier than December 4, 2022. That can't be. So there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the user meant from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2023? That would make sense. But the user wrote 2022 for both dates. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. But assuming that the user is correct, and the dates are as given, then there's a problem. Because December 4, 2022 is later than January 14, 2022. So the period from December 4 to January 14 would be invalid. Therefore, perhaps the user intended the end date to be January 14, 2023. But since the user wrote 2022, maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user meant from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022, but that would be a period that goes backward in time, which is not possible. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the user's question. However, since the user is asking for the answer, I need to proceed with the given dates, even if they are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the end date to be January 14, 2023. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the period would be from December 4, 2022 to January 14, 2023. Let's proceed with that assumption, because otherwise the dates don't make sense. But the user wrote 2022 for both dates. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the end date is January 14, 2023. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?\"\n\nWait, that's impossible. Because December 4, 2022 is later than January 14, 2022. So the period from December 4 to January 14 would be going backward in time. Therefore, the user must have made a mistake. But since the user is asking for the answer, perhaps they intended the end date to be January 14, 2023. Alternatively, maybe the user meant from Sunday, December 4, 2022 to Saturday, January 14, 2023. Let me check that.\n\nAssuming that the end date is January 14, 2023, then the period is from December 4, 2022 to January 14, 2023. Let's proceed with that. Because otherwise, the dates don't make sense. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the end date is January 14, 2023. But the user wrote 2022. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the start date to be January 4, 2022, but that's not what's written. This is confusing. However, given that the user wrote both dates as 2022, perhaps there's a mistake in the question. But since I need to answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that the end date is January 14, 2023, and that the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the start date to be January 4, 2022, but that's not what's written. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the end date to be January 14, 2022, but that's earlier than December 4, 2022. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if the end date is January 14, 2023. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo, assuming the end date is January 14, 2023, then the period is from December 4, 2022 to January 14, 2023. Let's calculate the total days between those dates.\n\nDecember 4, 2022 to December 31, 2022: 31 - 4 + 1 = 28 days.\n\nJanuary 1, 2023 to January 14, 2023: 14 days.\n\nTotal days: 28 + 14 = 42 days.\n\nNow, the start date is Sunday, December 4, 2022. Let's list the weekends in this period.\n\nDecember 4 (Sunday), 11 (Sunday), 18 (Sunday), 25 (Sunday), and January 1 (Saturday), 8 (Saturday), 15 (Saturday). Wait, but January 14 is the end date, which is a Saturday. So the weekends would be:\n\nIn December: Sundays on 4, 11, 18, 25.\n\nIn January: Saturdays on 1, 8, 15. But the end date is January 14, so January 15 is not included. So the Saturdays in January would be 1 and 8. Wait, January 1 is a Saturday, January 8 is a Saturday, and January 15 is a Saturday, but since the end date is January 14, we don't include January 15. So the weekends in January are 1 and 8.\n\nSo total weekends: 4 (December Sundays) + 2 (January Saturdays) = 6 weekends.\n\nTherefore, the total business days would be 42 total days - 6 weekends = 36 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let's list all the days from December 4 to January 14, 2023, and count the weekends.\n\nDecember 4 (Sunday) - weekend\n\nDecember 5 (Monday) - business\n\nDecember 6 (Tuesday) - business\n\nDecember 7 (Wednesday) - business\n\nDecember 8 (Thursday) - business\n\nDecember 9 (Friday) - business\n\nDecember 10 (Saturday) - weekend\n\nDecember 11 (Sunday) - weekend\n\nDecember 12 (Monday) - business\n\nDecember 13 (Tuesday) - business\n\nDecember 14 (Wednesday) - business\n\nDecember 15 (Thursday) - business\n\nDecember 16 (Friday) - business\n\nDecember 17 (Saturday) - weekend\n\nDecember 18 (Sunday) - weekend\n\nDecember 19 (Monday) - business\n\nDecember 20 (Tuesday) - business\n\nDecember 21 (Wednesday) - business\n\nDecember 22 (Thursday) - business\n\nDecember 23 (Friday) - business\n\nDecember 24 (Saturday) - weekend\n\nDecember 25 (Sunday) - weekend\n\nDecember 26 (Monday) - business\n\nDecember 27 (Tuesday) - business\n\nDecember 28 (Wednesday) - business\n\nDecember 29 (Thursday) - business\n\nDecember 30 (Friday) - business\n\nDecember 31 (Saturday) - weekend\n\nJanuary 1 (Sunday) - weekend\n\nJanuary 2 (Monday) - business\n\nJanuary 3 (Tuesday) - business\n\nJanuary 4 (Wednesday) - business\n\nJanuary 5 (Thursday) - business\n\nJanuary 6 (Friday) - business\n\nJanuary 7 (Saturday) - weekend\n\nJanuary 8 (Sunday) - weekend\n\nJanuary 9 (Monday) - business\n\nJanuary 10 (Tuesday) - business\n\nJanuary 11 (Wednesday) - business\n\nJanuary 12 (Thursday) - business\n\nJanuary 13 (Friday) - business\n\nJanuary 14 (Saturday) - weekend\n\nWait, but the end date is January 14, which is a Saturday. So the weekends are:\n\nDecember 4, 10, 11, 17, 25, 31 (December) and January 1, 7, 8, 14 (January). Wait, that's 4 + 4 = 8 weekends? Wait, but earlier I thought there were 6. Let me count again.\n\nLooking at the list above:\n\nWeekends in"], [124, "On which weekday did June 26, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 26, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, let me check that. If I remember correctly, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. \n\nWait, I think 2022 started on a Sunday. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Hmm, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's think about known dates. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. July 4, 2022: if I count backwards, June has 30 days. So June 26 is 4 days before July 4. If July 4 is a Monday, then June 26 would be 4 days earlier. So subtracting 4 days from Monday: Monday minus 1 day is Sunday, minus 2 is Saturday, minus 3 is Friday, minus 4 is Thursday. Wait, so that would mean June 26, 2022 was a Thursday? But I need to make sure that July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another reference. Let's think about the week of June 26. Let's say I know that June 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Wait, if June 1 is Tuesday, then June 6 is Sunday, June 13 is Sunday, June 20 is Sunday, and June 27 is Sunday. Wait, that would mean June 26 is Saturday. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check a different approach. Let me think about the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me verify that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8, 15, 22, 29 would also be Saturdays. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. So February 26, 2022 was a Saturday. Then March 6, 13, 20, 27 would be Saturdays. March 27 is a Saturday. Then April 3, 10, 17, 24, May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Saturdays. So May 29 is a Saturday. Then June 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. So June 26, 2022 would be a Saturday. But earlier I thought July 4 was a Monday, which would make June 26 a Thursday. There's a contradiction here. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. Let me think about 2021. I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. That seems correct. So if that's the case, then June 26, 2022 would be a Saturday. But then July 4, 2022 would be 7 days later, which is the same day. Wait, July 4 is 8 days after June 26. Wait, June has 30 days, so June 26 plus 4 days is July 4. So if June 26 is Saturday, then July 4 would be Wednesday. But I thought earlier that July 4 was a Monday. That's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another method. Let me check the actual calendar. Wait, I can't access the internet, but maybe I can use another way. Let me think about the fact that June 26, 2022 is the 178th day of the year. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. Let me calculate the day of the week. If January 1 is a Saturday, then January 1 is day 1. Let's count the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so January 1 is day 1 (Saturday), day 31 is January 31, which is a Tuesday (since 31 days later is 31 mod 7 = 3 days later, so Saturday + 3 days is Tuesday). Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is day 31 + 28 = 59. 59 mod 7 is 3 (since 56 is 8 weeks, 59-56=3). So February 28 is a Tuesday + 3 days = Friday. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 59 + 31 = 90. 90 mod 7 is 90 - 84 = 6, so 6 days after Friday is Thursday. April has 30 days, so April 30 is day 90 + 30 = 120. 120 mod 7 is 120 - 119 = 1, so 1 day after Thursday is Friday. May has 31 days, so May 31 is day 120 + 31 = 151. 151 mod 7 is 151 - 147 = 4, so 4 days after Friday is Tuesday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is day 151 + 30 = 181. 181 mod 7 is 181 - 175 = 6, so 6 days after Tuesday is Monday. Therefore, June 30 is a Monday. Then June 26 is 4 days before June 30. So June 26 would be Monday minus 4 days. Monday minus 1 is Sunday, minus 2 is Saturday, minus 3 is Friday, minus 4 is Thursday. So June 26, 2022 would be a Thursday. But earlier calculation using the Saturday January 1 led to a different conclusion. Wait, but that must have been a mistake. Because if June 30 is Monday, then June 26 is Thursday. So that would mean that my previous calculation where I thought June 26 was Saturday was wrong. So where did I go wrong there?\n\nEarlier, I thought that June 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. But if June 26 is Thursday, then that's incorrect. So that suggests that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Wait, but I thought that January 1, 2021 was a Friday, and 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 would start on a Saturday. But according to the calculation above, June 26 is Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nLet me recheck the calculation of the day of the week for June 30. Let's start again. January 1, 2022 is Saturday. January has 31 days. So January 1 is Saturday, January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Saturday. February has 28 days, so February 28 is Saturday. March 7 is Saturday. March has 31 days, so March 28 is Saturday, March 29 is Sunday, March 30 is Monday, March 31 is Tuesday. April 7 is Tuesday. April has 30 days, so April 30 is Tuesday. May 7 is Tuesday. May has 31 days, so May 31 is Tuesday. June 7 is Tuesday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is Tuesday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation. Wait, this is confusing. Let me do it step by step again.\n\nIf January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday (day 1)\nJanuary 8: Saturday (day 8)\nJanuary 15: Saturday (day 15)\nJanuary 22: Saturday (day 22)\nJanuary 29: Saturday (day 29)\nFebruary 5: Saturday (day 36)\nFebruary 12: Saturday (day 43)\nFebruary 19: Saturday (day 50)\nFebruary 26: Saturday (day 57)\nMarch 5: Saturday (day 64)\nMarch 12: Saturday (day 71)\nMarch 19: Saturday (day 78)\nMarch 26: Saturday (day 85)\nMarch 31: Thursday (day 89)\nApril 1: Friday (day 90)\nApril 2: Saturday (day 91)\nApril 3: Sunday (day 92)\nApril 4: Monday (day 93)\nApril 5: Tuesday (day 94)\nApril 6: Wednesday (day 95)\nApril 7: Thursday (day 96)\nApril 8: Friday (day 97)\nApril 9: Saturday (day 98)\nApril 10: Sunday (day 99)\nApril 11: Monday (day 100)\nApril 12: Tuesday (day 101)\nApril 13: Wednesday (day 102)\nApril 14: Thursday (day 103)\nApril 15: Friday (day 104)\nApril 16: Saturday (day 105)\nApril 17: Sunday (day 106)\nApril 18: Monday (day 107)\nApril 19: Tuesday (day 108)\nApril 20: Wednesday (day 109)\nApril 21: Thursday (day 110)\nApril 22: Friday (day 111)\nApril 23: Saturday (day 112)\nApril 24: Sunday (day 113)\nApril 25: Monday (day 114)\nApril 26: Tuesday (day 115)\nApril 27: Wednesday (day 116)\nApril 28: Thursday (day 117)\nApril 29: Friday (day 118)\nApril 30: Saturday (day 119)\n\nWait, so April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. May has 31 days, so May 31 is Sunday + 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 31 is Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is Wednesday + 29 days. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day. So June 30 is Wednesday + 1 day = Thursday. Therefore, June 26 is 4 days before June 30, which would be Thursday minus 4 days. Thursday minus 1 is Wednesday, minus 2 is Tuesday, minus 3 is Monday, minus 4 is Sunday. Wait, that would mean June 26 is Sunday? But that contradicts the previous calculation where I thought June 30 was Saturday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me check again.\n\nIf April 30 is Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. May has 31 days, so May 31 is Sunday + 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days, so May 31 is Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is Wednesday + 29 days. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day, so June 30 is Wednesday + 1 day = Thursday. Therefore, June 26 is 4 days before June 30. So June 26 is Thursday minus 4 days. Let's count backwards: Thursday (June 30) minus 1 day is Wednesday (June 29), minus 2 is Tuesday (June 28), minus 3 is Monday (June 27), minus 4 is Sunday (June 26). So June 26, 2022 is Sunday. But earlier when I thought July 4 was Monday, that would mean June 26 is Thursday. But according to this calculation, it's Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the April 30 calculation. Let me check again. If April 30 is Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. May has 31 days, so May 31 is Sunday + 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days, so May 31 is Sunday + 2 days = Tuesday. Then June 1 is Wednesday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is Wednesday + 29 days. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day, so June 30 is Wednesday + 1 day = Thursday. Therefore, June 26 is Thursday minus 4 days = Sunday. So that would mean June 26 is Sunday. But then July 4 is 8 days after June 26, which would be Sunday + 8 days = Sunday. But I thought July 4 was a Monday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption that April 30 is Saturday. Let me check the April 30 calculation again.\n\nIf January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. February 5 is Saturday. February 12, 19, 26 are Saturdays. March 5 is Saturday. March 12, 19, 26 are Saturdays. March 31 is Tuesday. April 7 is Tuesday. April 14 is Tuesday. April 21 is Tuesday. April 28 is Tuesday. Then April 29 is Wednesday, April 30 is Thursday. Wait, that's different from before. So April 30 is Thursday. Then May 1 is Friday. May 31 is Friday + 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days, so May 31 is Friday + 2 days = Sunday. Then June 1 is Monday. June has 30 days, so June 30 is Monday + 29 days. 29 days is 4 weeks and 1 day, so June 30 is Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. Therefore, June 26 is 4 days before June 30, which is Tuesday minus 4 days. Tuesday minus 1 is Monday, minus 2 is Sunday, minus 3 is Saturday, minus 4 is Friday. So June 26 is Friday. But this contradicts the previous calculation. Now I'm really confused. \n\nI think I need to find a better way. Maybe I should use Zeller's Congruence. Let me recall the formula. Zeller's Congruence for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for the given date, June 26, 2022, we need to adjust the month and year. So June is month 6, so no adjustment needed. So m = 6, q = 26, year is 2022. So K = 22, J = 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (26 + floor((13*(6 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nfloor((13*7)/5) = floor(91/5) = floor(18.2) = 18\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n26 + 18 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 26 + 18 is 44, plus 22 is 66, plus 5 is 71, plus 5 is 76, plus 100 is 176.\n\nNow 176 mod 7. Let's divide 176 by 7. 7*25 = 175, so 176 - 175 = 1. So h = 1.\n\nAccording to Zeller's Congruence, h = 1 corresponds to Sunday (since 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday). Therefore, June 26, 2022 was a Sunday. But earlier calculations were"], [124, "Name the day of the week for 06/29/2022. Respond with the weekday (Monday-Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 29, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know the day of the week for. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards to June 29.\n\nSo, July 4 is Monday. Let's count the days between June 29 and July 4. June has 30 days, so June 29 is 1 day before June 30, and then July 1 is the next day. So from June 29 to July 4 is 5 days. Wait, June 29 to June 30 is 1 day, then July 1 to July 4 is 4 days. So total of 5 days. So if July 4 is Monday, then June 29 would be 5 days before that. Let's count backwards: July 4 (Monday) minus 1 day is June 30 (Sunday), minus 2 days is June 29 (Saturday). Wait, that would make June 29 a Saturday? But I need to make sure that my reference date is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another date. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me see if that helps. Wait, December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Let's count backwards from there. But that might take longer. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me think. If I can find a correct reference date, that would help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 29, 2022 is the same as June 29, 2022. Let me think of another way. Let's check the number of days in each month. June has 30 days, so June 29 is 1 day before June 30. If I can find the day of the week for June 30, then subtract one day. But how do I find June 30's day?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is a Friday. Wait, July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. That seems correct. So July 1 is Friday. Then, June 30 would be Thursday. Because June 30 is the day before July 1. So June 30 is Thursday. Then June 29 would be Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Wait, earlier I thought June 29 was Saturday, but now I'm getting Wednesday. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me re-examine. If July 4 is Monday, then July 4 minus 5 days is June 29. Let's count backwards:\n\nJuly 4 (Monday) minus 1 day is July 3 (Sunday)\nminus 2 days is July 2 (Saturday)\nminus 3 days is July 1 (Friday)\nminus 4 days is June 30 (Thursday)\nminus 5 days is June 29 (Wednesday)\n\nSo that would make June 29 a Wednesday. But earlier I thought it was Saturday. So where did I go wrong before? Oh, I think I miscalculated the number of days between June 29 and July 4. Let me check again. June 29 to June 30 is 1 day. Then July 1 to July 4 is 4 days. So total of 5 days. So June 29 is 5 days before July 4. So if July 4 is Monday, then June 29 is 5 days earlier. So Monday minus 5 days is Wednesday. So that would be correct. Therefore, June 29, 2022 was a Wednesday.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm that July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me check that. If I can recall, July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. So July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday, July 3 is Sunday, July 4 is Monday. That's correct. So that confirms that July 4 is Monday. Therefore, June 29 is Wednesday. So the answer should be Wednesday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. For example, using Zeller's Congruence. Let me try that. Zeller's formula for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for the given date of June 29, 2022, m is 6, and the year is 2022. So q is 29, m is 6, K is 22, J is 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (29 + floor((13*(6 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nfloor((13*7)/5) = floor(91/5) = floor(18.2) = 18\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n29 + 18 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 29 + 18 is 47, plus 22 is 69, plus 5 is 74, plus 5 is 79, plus 100 is 179.\n\nNow 179 mod 7. Let's divide 179 by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 179 - 175 is 4. So h = 4.\n\nAccording to Zeller's formula, h=4 corresponds to Thursday? Wait, because h=0 is Saturday, 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, 3 is Tuesday, 4 is Wednesday, 5 is Thursday, 6 is Friday. Wait, so h=4 is Wednesday. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, June 29, 2022 was a Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Wednesday.", "Wednesday"], [124, "What day of the week was May 31, 2022? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to find out what day of the week May 31, 2022 was. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know for sure. For example, I remember that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should use a different approach. Let me think about the number of days between a known date and May 31, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that if I know the day of the week for a certain date, I can count forward or backward. For example, if I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then May 31 would be 30 days later. Since 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, and May 29 is Sunday. Then May 30 would be Monday, and May 31 would be Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean May 31, 2022 was a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, maybe I should check a different known date. For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me confirm that. If April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then April 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Fridays. Then May 6 would be a Friday. Then May 13, 20, 27 would be Fridays. So May 31 would be 4 days after May 27. So May 27 is Friday, then May 28 is Saturday, 29 Sunday, 30 Monday, 31 Tuesday. So that would make May 31, 2022 a Tuesday. But I need to make sure that April 1, 2022 was indeed a Friday. Alternatively, maybe I can check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Saturdays. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. March 5, 12, 19, 26 would be Saturdays. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 would be Saturdays. So April 30, 2022 was a Saturday. Then May 1 would be a Sunday. Then May 8, 15, 22, 29 would be Sundays. So May 29 is Sunday, then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that would again lead me to Tuesday. So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check an online source or a calendar, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Wait, but I think that if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then that's correct. Let me think about the year 2022. For example, I know that 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. So if January 1 is Saturday, then January 2 is Sunday, and so on. Then, for example, January 31 would be a Monday (since 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days, so 3 days after Saturday is Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is Saturday. Then January 1 + 7 days is January 8, which is Saturday again. So January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 29 is Saturday, so January 30 is Sunday, January 31 is Monday. So that's correct. Then February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 7, 14, 21, 28 are Tuesdays. March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 7, 14, 21, 28 are Tuesdays. April 1 is a Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, if March 1 is Tuesday, then March 8 is Tuesday, March 15, 22, 29. April 5 is Tuesday. Then April 1 would be the previous week, so April 1 would be a Saturday. Wait, that's correct. So April 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but earlier I thought April 1 was a Friday. That's conflicting. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if March 1 is a Tuesday, then March 8 is Tuesday, March 15 is Tuesday, March 22 is Tuesday, March 29 is Tuesday. Then April 5 is Tuesday. So April 1 would be the previous week, which would be a Saturday. So April 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then April 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. So April 29 is Saturday. Then May 6 is Saturday. Then May 13, 20, 27 are Saturdays. So May 27 is Saturday. Then May 28 is Sunday, 29 is Monday, 30 is Tuesday, 31 is Wednesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me retrace. If January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. So January 29 is Saturday. Then February 5 is Saturday, 12, 19, 26. So February 26 is Saturday. Then March 5 is Saturday. March 5 is Saturday. Then March 12, 19, 26 are Saturdays. April 2 is Saturday. Then April 9, 16, 23, 30 are Saturdays. So April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. So May 29 is Sunday. Then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that would make May 31, 2022 a Tuesday. But according to the other calculation where April 1 is Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday, which is consistent. So that would mean May 31 is Tuesday. But earlier when I thought April 1 was Friday, that was a mistake. So the correct calculation is that May 31 is Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another way. Let's use the fact that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Then May 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. So May 29 is Sunday. Then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [124, "Count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022 - what's the weekday? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count backward 81 days from Tuesday, October 4, 2022, and find out what day of the week that falls on. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can divide 81 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days there are. Let me do that calculation. 81 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 4 days because 11 times 7 is 77, and 81 minus 77 is 4. So, going back 81 days is the same as going back 11 weeks and 4 days. Since 11 weeks is exactly 77 days, which brings me back to the same day of the week, the remaining 4 days will determine the weekday.\n\nNow, starting from Tuesday, October 4, 2022. If I go back 4 days, what day is that? Let's count. One day before Tuesday is Monday, two days before is Sunday, three days before is Saturday, and four days before is Friday. Wait, so going back 4 days from Tuesday would be Friday? But wait, maybe I should check that again. Let me count again. Tuesday minus 1 day is Monday, minus 2 is Sunday, minus 3 is Saturday, minus 4 is Friday. Yes, that's correct. So if I subtract 4 days from Tuesday, it's Friday. Therefore, the weekday should be Friday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify this with another method to be sure. Maybe by checking the actual dates. Let me try to count backward step by step. Starting from October 4, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let's subtract 81 days. But that's a lot of days. Maybe breaking it down into months.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's see. October has 31 days. So October 4 minus 4 days would be September 30, but that's only 4 days back. Wait, maybe I should go step by step. But that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe using a calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my calculations.\n\nAnother way: if I know that 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days, then subtracting 11 weeks (77 days) from October 4, 2022, would still be October 4, 2022, minus 77 days. Let me calculate that. October has 31 days, so October 4 minus 31 days is September 4, 2022. Then subtract another 31 days (for September), which would be August 4, 2022. Then subtract another 31 days (for July), which would be July 4, 2022. Wait, but that's 31 + 31 + 31 = 93 days, which is more than 77. So maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, 77 days is 11 weeks. So October 4 minus 77 days. Let's subtract 77 days from October 4. Let's break it down. October has 31 days. So October 4 minus 31 days is September 4. Then subtract another 31 days (September has 30 days, so September 4 minus 30 days is August 4, 2022. Wait, that's 31 + 30 = 61 days. Then subtract another 16 days (since 77 - 61 = 16). So August 4 minus 16 days is July 18, 2022. Wait, but that's 77 days? Let me check. From October 4, subtract 31 days (October 4 - 31 days = September 4). Then subtract 30 days (September 4 - 30 days = August 4). Then subtract 16 days (August 4 - 16 days = July 18). So total is 31 + 30 + 16 = 77 days. So July 18, 2022, is 77 days before October 4, 2022. Then, since 77 days is exactly 11 weeks, the day of the week is the same as October 4, 2022, which is Tuesday. Then, subtracting the remaining 4 days (81 - 77 = 4) from July 18, 2022. So July 18 minus 4 days is July 14, 2022. Wait, but that would be 4 days before July 18. Let me check: July 18 minus 1 day is July 17, minus 2 is July 16, minus 3 is July 15, minus 4 is July 14. So July 14, 2022. Now, what day of the week is July 14, 2022?\n\nWait, but I need to confirm that. If October 4, 2022, is a Tuesday, then July 14, 2022, would be 81 days before. But how do I know what day July 14, 2022, is? Maybe I can check by counting the days between July 14 and October 4. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think. If I know that July 14 is 81 days before October 4, then if I can find the weekday of July 14, that would be the answer. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if I go back 4 days from Tuesday, it's Friday. But if that's correct, then the answer is Friday. But I need to make sure that my initial calculation is correct. Let me check with another approach. Let's use the fact that each month has a certain number of days and calculate the date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 4, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let me check what day July 14, 2022, is. Let's count the days between July 14 and October 4. July has 31 days, so from July 14 to July 31 is 17 days. August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. September has 30 days, adding 30 days. Then October 4 is 4 days. So total days from July 14 to October 4 is 17 + 31 + 30 + 4 = 82 days. Wait, that's 82 days. But I thought that July 14 is 81 days before October 4. So that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous calculation. Let me check again.\n\nIf July 14 is 81 days before October 4, then the number of days between July 14 and October 4 should be 81 days. But according to my calculation, it's 17 (July 14 to July 31) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 4 (October 4) = 17 + 31 is 48, plus 30 is 78, plus 4 is 82. So that's 82 days. Therefore, July 14 is 82 days before October 4. That means my previous calculation was wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nEarlier, I thought that subtracting 77 days (11 weeks) from October 4 would get me to July 18, then subtracting 4 days would get me to July 14. But that seems to be incorrect. Let me check again. Let's calculate the number of days between July 18 and October 4. July has 31 days, so from July 18 to July 31 is 13 days. August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October 4 is 4 days. So total is 13 + 31 + 30 + 4 = 78 days. So July 18 is 78 days before October 4. Then, if I subtract 77 days (11 weeks) from October 4, that would be July 18, which is 78 days before. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe my initial calculation of 77 days was wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. So if I subtract 77 days (11 weeks) from October 4, that should be 77 days before. Let me calculate that. October 4 minus 77 days. Let's break it down. October has 31 days. So October 4 minus 31 days is September 4. Then September has 30 days, so September 4 minus 30 days is August 4. Then August 4 minus 31 days is July 4. Wait, that's 31 + 30 + 31 = 92 days. That's too much. Wait, maybe I need to subtract 77 days step by step. Let's do it properly.\n\nStarting from October 4, 2022. Subtract 31 days (October) to get September 4. Then subtract 30 days (September) to get August 4. That's 31 + 30 = 61 days. Then subtract 16 days (since 77 - 61 = 16) from August 4. August 4 minus 16 days is July 18. So July 18 is 77 days before October 4. Then, July 18 plus 4 days is July 22. Wait, but that's adding days, not subtracting. Wait, no. If I subtract 77 days, then subtract 4 more days, that's 81 days total. So July 18 minus 4 days is July 14. But earlier calculation said that July 14 is 82 days before October 4. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a different approach. Let's check the actual dates. Let me try to find the day of the week for July 14, 2022. If I can find that, then that would be the answer. But how?\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 4, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let's count backward 81 days. Let's break it down into weeks and days. 81 divided by 7 is 11 weeks (77 days) and 4 days. So going back 11 weeks is the same day, Tuesday. Then going back 4 days from Tuesday is Friday. So the answer should be Friday. But earlier when I tried to calculate the date, I got conflicting results. Maybe I made a mistake in the date calculation. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. If October 4 is Tuesday, then October 1 is a Saturday (since October 4 is Tuesday, subtract 3 days). Then September 30 is a Friday. Let me check that. Wait, October 1 is Saturday, so September 30 is Friday. Then September 23 is Friday, September 16 is Friday, September 9 is Friday, September 2 is Friday, August 26 is Friday, August 19 is Friday, August 12 is Friday, August 5 is Friday, July 29 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 8 is Friday, July 1 is Friday. Wait, that's July 1 is Friday. Then July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. So July 29 is Friday. Then July 29 plus 5 days is August 3 (Saturday), August 10 (Saturday), August 17 (Saturday), August 24 (Saturday), September 1 (Saturday), September 8 (Saturday), September 15 (Saturday), September 22 (Saturday), September 29 (Saturday), October 6 (Saturday). Wait, but October 4 is Tuesday. That doesn't match. So there's a problem here. Maybe my assumption that October 1 is Saturday is wrong.\n\nWait, let's check. If October 4 is Tuesday, then October 1 is 3 days before, which would be Saturday. But if October 1 is Saturday, then October 8 is Saturday, October 15 is Saturday, etc. But if October 4 is Tuesday, then October 5 is Wednesday, October 6 is Thursday, October 7 is Friday, October 8 is Saturday. So that's correct. Then September 30 is Friday. So September 30 is Friday. Then September 23 is Friday, September 16 is Friday, September 9 is Friday, September 2 is Friday, August 26 is Friday, August 19 is Friday, August 12 is Friday, August 5 is Friday, July 29 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 8 is Friday, July 1 is Friday. So July 1 is Friday. Then July 8 is Friday, July 15 is Friday, July 22 is Friday, July 29 is Friday. So July 29 is Friday. Then July 29 plus 5 days is August 3 (Saturday), August 10 (Saturday), August 17 (Saturday), August 24 (Saturday), September 1 (Saturday), September 8 (Saturday), September 15 (Saturday), September 22 (Saturday), September 29 (Saturday), October 6 (Saturday). But October 4 is Tuesday, which is two days before October 6. So October 6 is Saturday, so October 5 is Friday, October 4 is Thursday? Wait, that contradicts the original statement that October 4 is Tuesday. So there's a mistake here. Therefore, my assumption that October 1 is Saturday must be wrong. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for October 4. Let me check. If I can find the correct day of the week for October 4, 2022. Wait, I think I remember that October 4, 2022, was a Tuesday. But according to my calculation, if July 1 is Friday, then July 29 is Friday, August 5 is Friday, August 12 is Friday, August 19 is Friday, August 26 is Friday, September 2 is Friday, September 9 is Friday, September 16 is Friday, September 23 is Friday, September 30 is Friday, October 7 is Friday, October 14 is Friday, October 21 is Friday, October 28 is Friday. Wait, but October 4 is two days before October 6, which would be Saturday. So October 4 would be Thursday. But that contradicts the original statement. Therefore, there must be an error in my calculation. So maybe my initial assumption that October 4 is Tuesday is wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake in the day count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me check the actual day of the week for October 4, 2022. Wait, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2022, is a Sunday, then I can count the days to October 4. But that might take a while. Alternatively, I can use the fact that October 4, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let me check that with another method. For example, using the fact that March 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I know that October 4, 2022, is a Tuesday. Let me accept that for now, even though my previous calculation suggested otherwise. Maybe I made a mistake in the day count.\n\nIf October 4 is Tuesday, then going back 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days. So 11 weeks is 77 days, so 81-77=4 days. So going back 4 days from Tuesday is Friday. Therefore, the answer should be Friday. But I need to make sure that my calculation of the days is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 81 days is 11 weeks and 4 days, so the weekday is the same as Tuesday minus 4 days, which is Friday. Therefore, the answer is Friday.", "Friday"], [124, "If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: If the first day of the year was a Saturday, what day of the week will March 25 be? And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so first, I need to figure out how many days are there from January 1st to March 25th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the year. Since the first day of the year is a Saturday, I assume it's a non-leap year unless specified otherwise. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention whether it's a leap year or not. Hmm. Wait, but March 25th is before February 29th, so if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the question doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a common year? Or maybe the problem is designed in a way that doesn't require knowing if it's a leap year. Wait, but March 25th is in March, so if the year is a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the first day of the year is a Saturday, maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the first day of the year was a Saturday\". So if it's a leap year, then February has 29 days. But since the first day of the year is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. So if the year is a leap year, then February 29 would be a certain day. But March 25 is after February 29, so the number of days from January 1 to March 25 would be different in a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's a leap year. Hmm. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved assuming a non-leap year? Or maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem is probably set in a non-leap year because if it's a leap year, the problem would have mentioned it. Or maybe not. But since the problem is from a general context, maybe I should proceed with a non-leap year. Let me check the number of days in each month.\n\nIn a non-leap year, January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31 days. So from January 1 to March 25, the total days would be 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 25 (March) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 25 is 84 days. Wait, but wait, if March 25 is the day we're looking for, then from January 1 to March 25 is 31 + 28 + 25? Wait, no. Wait, January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 1 to March 25 is 25 days. So total days from January 1 to March 25 is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. Wait, but that's 84 days total. Wait, but if you count from January 1 to March 25 inclusive, that's 84 days. But if you want to find the day of the week, you need to calculate how many days have passed since the first day (which is Saturday). So if January 1 is day 0 (Saturday), then day 1 is January 2, which is Sunday, etc. Wait, but the number of days between January 1 and March 25 is 84 days. Wait, but if January 1 is day 0, then March 25 is day 83? Or day 84? Wait, this is a common confusion. Let me think again.\n\nIf January 1 is day 1 (Saturday), then January 2 is day 2 (Sunday), and so on. But if you count the number of days between January 1 and March 25, inclusive, it's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 25 (Mar) = 84 days. But if you want to find how many days have passed since January 1, then March 25 is 83 days later. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 2 is day 2, so the number of days between January 1 and March 25 is 84 days. But if you want to find the number of days that have passed since January 1, then March 25 is 84 days after January 1. Wait, but that would mean that the day of the week is (Saturday + 84 days). But since 7 days a week, 84 divided by 7 is 12 weeks exactly. So 84 days later would be the same day of the week. So if January 1 is Saturday, then March 25 would also be a Saturday? But that seems too easy. Wait, but that would be the case if the total number of days is a multiple of 7. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 25 is 25 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 25 is 31 + 28 + 25 = 84 days. So 84 days later. Since 84 divided by 7 is 12, so 12 weeks. So the same day of the week. Therefore, March 25 would be a Saturday. But wait, that seems correct? But I think I might be making a mistake here. Because if January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is also Saturday, and so on. So 7 days later is same day. So 84 days later is 12 weeks later, same day. So March 25 would be Saturday. But wait, that seems too straightforward. But maybe that's correct. However, I need to check if the calculation of days is correct.\n\nWait, let me check the actual dates. For example, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26. Then March 5, 12, 19, 26. So March 26 is Saturday. Therefore, March 25 would be Friday. Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! Here's the problem. The total number of days from January 1 to March 25 is 84 days. But if you count from January 1 (day 1) to March 25 (day 84), then the number of days between them is 83 days. Because if you have day 1 and day 2, that's 1 day apart. So if you have day 1 (Jan 1) and day 84 (March 25), then the number of days between them is 83. Therefore, the day of the week would be 83 days later. Wait, but 83 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 6 days. So 83 days later would be 11 weeks and 6 days. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. So that would make March 25 a Friday. But earlier calculation said 84 days later, which would be 12 weeks, same day. So which is correct?\n\nThis is the confusion between inclusive and exclusive counting. So if you have January 1 as day 0 (Saturday), then January 2 is day 1 (Sunday), and so on. So the number of days from January 1 to March 25 is 84 days. But if you want to find how many days have passed since January 1, then March 25 is 83 days later. Because January 1 is day 0, and March 25 is day 83. So 83 days later. So 83 divided by 7 is 11 weeks and 6 days. So Saturday + 6 days is Friday. Therefore, March 25 would be Friday. But when I counted the dates, March 26 is Saturday, so March 25 is Friday. That matches. So the correct answer is Friday. Therefore, the mistake was in the initial calculation where I thought 84 days later, but actually it's 83 days later. So the correct answer is Friday.\n\nBut why is there a discrepancy? Because when you count the number of days between two dates, inclusive or exclusive. So if you have January 1 (day 1) and March 25 (day 84), then the number of days between them is 84 - 1 = 83 days. So the correct way is to calculate the total days from January 1 to March 25, subtract 1 to get the number of days passed since January 1. Wait, but maybe another way is to calculate the total days from January 1 to March 25, and then take that number modulo 7. So if the total days is 84, then 84 mod 7 is 0, which would mean same day. But that's conflicting with the other approach. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's take a small example. Suppose January 1 is Saturday. Then January 2 is Sunday. So the number of days between January 1 and January 2 is 1 day. So if I calculate the total days from January 1 to January 2, that's 2 days. But the number of days passed since January 1 is 1 day. So the formula is (total days - 1) mod 7. So if total days is 2, then (2-1) = 1 day later. So that would be Sunday. Which is correct. So in the case of March 25, total days from January 1 to March 25 is 84 days. So (84 - 1) = 83 days later. 83 mod 7 is 83 / 7 = 11 * 7 = 77, 83 - 77 = 6. So 6 days later. Saturday + 6 days is Friday. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Friday.\n\nBut why did the initial calculation of 84 days later give the same day? Because if you count the number of days from January 1 to March 25 inclusive, that's 84 days. But if you want to find the day of the week, you need to find how many days have passed since the first day. So if January 1 is day 0 (Saturday), then March 25 is day 83. So 83 days later. Therefore, the correct answer is Friday.\n\nSo the answer should be Friday.

If that's correct, then the days would go like this:\n\nNovember 1 is Tuesday. So the first Thursday would be the 3rd. Because Tuesday is 1, Wednesday 2, Thursday 3. Then the second Thursday would be the 10th (adding 7 days), and the third would be the 17th. Wait, but wait, let me check again. If November 1 is Tuesday, then:\n\n- 1st: Tuesday\n- 2nd: Wednesday\n- 3rd: Thursday (first Thursday)\n- 10th: Thursday (second)\n- 17th: Thursday (third)\n- 24th: Thursday (fourth)\n- 31st: Thursday (fifth)\n\nSo the third Thursday would be the 17th. But wait, does November 2022 actually have 31 days? Yes, November has 30 days. Wait, no, wait. Wait, November has 30 days. Wait, 31 days? No, November has 30 days. Wait, wait, no, November has 30 days. Wait, but 31st is not in November. Wait, so if the third Thursday is the 17th, then that's correct. Let me check again. If November 1 is Tuesday, then:\n\nFirst Thursday is 3rd. Then adding 7 days: 3 +7=10, that's second. Then 10+7=17, third. Then 17+7=24, fourth. Then 24+7=31, but November only has 30 days. So the fourth Thursday would be the 24th, and the fifth would be the 31st, which doesn't exist. So the third Thursday is the 17th. Therefore, the answer should be 17. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again. Maybe I should verify the actual calendar for November 2022. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think. Alternatively, I can check online, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my knowledge. Wait, I think that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. So November has 30 days. So December 1 is Thursday. So November 30 would be Wednesday. Because December 1 is Thursday, so November 30 is Wednesday. Then, November 1 is Tuesday. Let me count from November 1 (Tuesday) to November 30 (Wednesday). Let's check: 30 days. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if November 1 is Tuesday, then November 29 is Tuesday again (since 28 days is 4 weeks). Then November 30 is Wednesday. That matches. So that's correct. So November 1 is Tuesday. Therefore, the first Thursday is the 3rd. Then the third Thursday is the 17th. So the answer should be 17. But wait, maybe I should check if there's a mistake here. Let me list the dates:\n\nNovember 1: Tuesday\n\nNovember 2: Wednesday\n\nNovember 3: Thursday (1st Thursday)\n\nNovember 10: Thursday (2nd)\n\nNovember 17: Thursday (3rd)\n\nYes, that's correct.

First, I should figure out the dates of each Thursday in that range.\n\nLet me start by checking the starting date. April 3, 2022, is a Sunday. So the next day, April 4, is a Monday. Then April 5 is Tuesday, April 6 is Wednesday, April 7 is Thursday. So the first Thursday in the range is April 7, 2022.\n\nNow, I need to find all the Thursdays from that date up to June 28, 2022. Let me list them out step by step. \n\nStarting with April 7, 2022. Then adding 7 days each time. Let's see:\n\nApril 7 (Thu)\nApril 14 (Thu)\nApril 21 (Thu)\nApril 28 (Thu)\nMay 5 (Thu)\nMay 12 (Thu)\nMay 19 (Thu)\nMay 26 (Thu)\nJune 2 (Thu)\nJune 9 (Thu)\nJune 16 (Thu)\nJune 23 (Thu)\nJune 30 (Thu)\n\nWait, but the end date is June 28. So June 30 is beyond that. So the last Thursday would be June 23, 2022. Let me check that.\n\nWait, June 23 is a Thursday. Then June 23 + 7 days is July 1, which is outside the range. So the last one is June 23. Let me count how many that is.\n\nStarting from April 7:\n\n1. April 7\n2. April 14\n3. April 21\n4. April 28\n5. May 5\n6. May 12\n7. May 19\n8. May 26\n9. June 2\n10. June 9\n11. June 16\n12. June 23\n\nSo that's 12 Thursdays. Wait, but let me verify each date to make sure I didn't skip any or include an extra.\n\nLet me check each month:\n\nApril: 7, 14, 21, 28. That's 4 Thursdays.\n\nMay: 5, 12, 19, 26. That's 4 more, total 8.\n\nJune: 2, 9, 16, 23. That's 4, making total 12. But wait, June 23 is within the range (June 28 is the end date). So yes, 4 in June. So total 4+4+4=12.\n\nBut wait, let me check if June 23 is indeed a Thursday. Let me check the actual calendar for 2022. Alternatively, I can calculate the day of the week for June 23, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, since April 7 is a Thursday, adding 7 days each time. Let me check the dates:\n\nApril 7 (Thu)\nApril 14 (Thu)\nApril 21 (Thu)\nApril 28 (Thu)\nMay 5 (Thu)\nMay 12 (Thu)\nMay 19 (Thu)\nMay 26 (Thu)\nJune 2 (Thu)\nJune 9 (Thu)\nJune 16 (Thu)\nJune 23 (Thu)\n\nYes, that's 12 Thursdays.

So yes, 12 Thursdays in total.", "12"], [124, "Between Tuesday, April 12, 2022 and Wednesday, June 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Monday occur? Write the total number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many Mondays there are between Tuesday, April 12, 2022, and Wednesday, June 1, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out the total number of days in that period and then determine how many of those days are Mondays.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to find the day of the week for April 12, 2022, and then count the Mondays from there. Let me check. April 12, 2022, was a Tuesday. So if I start on Tuesday, April 12, then the next day, April 13, is Wednesday, and so on. Let me confirm that. Let me think about the days of the week.\n\nSo, starting from April 12 (Tuesday), the next Monday would be April 18, right? Because April 12 is Tuesday, so adding 6 days gets to Monday. Wait, no. Wait, Tuesday plus 1 day is Wednesday, plus 2 is Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday. So yes, April 18 is a Monday. Then the next Monday would be April 25, then May 2, May 9, May 16, May 23, May 30, and then June 6, June 13, June 20, June 27. Wait, but the end date is June 1, 2022. So June 1 is a Wednesday. So I need to check how many Mondays are between April 12 and June 1 inclusive.\n\nLet me list out the dates. Let's start with April 12 (Tuesday). Let's count the Mondays in April first. April 12 is Tuesday. So the first Monday after that would be April 18. Then April 25. Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. Then in June, the first Monday would be June 6, but June 1 is Wednesday, so June 6 is a Monday. Then June 13, 20, 27. But June 27 is after June 1, so only up to June 1. So June 6 is the only Monday in June? Wait, June 1 is Wednesday, so June 6 is Monday. Then June 13 is the next, but that's after June 1. So only one Monday in June.\n\nSo let's count the Mondays in April: April 18, 25. That's two. Then May has 5 Mondays: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five. Then June has one Monday: June 6. So total is 2 + 5 + 1 = 8? Wait, but wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, April 12 is Tuesday. So April 18 is Monday (12 + 6 days). Then April 25 is the next Monday. Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five Mondays in May. Then June 6 is the next Monday. But June 1 is Wednesday, so June 6 is indeed a Monday. So that's one in June. So total is 2 + 5 + 1 = 8 Mondays. But wait, let me check if there are any other Mondays in April. Let me check the dates again.\n\nApril 12 is Tuesday. So April 13 is Wednesday, 14 Thursday, 15 Friday, 16 Saturday, 17 Sunday, 18 Monday. So yes, April 18 is the first Monday. Then April 25. Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five in May. Then June 6. So that's 2 + 5 + 1 = 8. But wait, maybe I need to check if the period includes June 1. Let me check the dates again. The period is from April 12 to June 1, inclusive. So June 1 is included. So June 6 is after June 1, so it's not included. Wait, that's a mistake! Wait, June 6 is after June 1. So if the end date is June 1, then June 6 is not included. So that would mean that there are only 2 + 5 = 7 Mondays? Wait, but what about May 30? May 30 is a Monday. Then June 6 is the next, but that's after June 1. So May 30 is included. So that's 2 in April, 5 in May, and 0 in June. So total 7? But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of days between April 12 and June 1, inclusive, and then divide by 7, but adjust for the remainder. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the total number of days. April has 30 days. So from April 12 to April 30 is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 is 1 day. So total days is 19 + 31 + 1 = 51 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, from April 12 to April 30 inclusive is 30 - 12 + 1 = 19 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that gives 19 + 31 = 50 days. Then June 1 is one more day, so total 51 days. So 51 days in total.\n\nNow, 51 divided by 7 is 7 weeks and 2 days. So there are 7 full weeks, which would have 7 Mondays, plus 2 extra days. Now, since April 12 is a Tuesday, the first day of the period is Tuesday. So the next day is Wednesday, and the 51 days would end on June 1, which is a Wednesday. So the extra two days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So the number of Mondays would be 7 (from the full weeks) plus 1 if the extra days include a Monday. But since the first day is Tuesday, the extra days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So no extra Monday. Therefore, total Mondays would be 7. But earlier I thought there were 8, but that was because I thought June 6 was included, but it's not. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me check again. If the total days are 51, and April 12 is Tuesday, then the first day is Tuesday. Let's count the Mondays. Let's list them:\n\nApril 12 is Tuesday. The first Monday is April 18 (6 days later). Then April 25 (another 7 days). Then May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 2 + 5 = 7 Mondays. Then June 6 would be the next, but that's after June 1. So total 7 Mondays. So that matches the 7 from the division method. So why did I think earlier that there were 8? Because I thought June 6 was included, but it's not. So the correct answer is 7?\n\nBut wait, let me check the actual dates. Let me check what day June 1, 2022, was. Wait, the user said that the end date is Wednesday, June 1, 2022. So if June 1 is a Wednesday, then June 6 is a Monday. So that's correct. So the Mondays in the period are April 18, 25, May 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 7 Mondays. So the answer is 7. But why did I think earlier that there were 8? Because I added June 6, but that's outside the period. So the correct answer is 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual calendar. Let me try to verify. Let me check the days for April 2022. April 12 is Tuesday. Let me check April 18: that's 6 days later, so Monday. Then April 25 is another 7 days, so Monday. Then May 2 is Monday. Then May 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 5 Mondays in May. So that's 2 + 5 = 7. Then June 6 is Monday, but that's after June 1. So yes, 7 Mondays.

Wait"], [124, "Between Saturday, March 19, 2022 and Sunday, May 8, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? State the amount as a number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between March 19, 2022 (Saturday) and May 8, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday. So weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to count the business days directly. Let me start by checking the dates.\n\nMarch 19, 2022 is a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Wait, March 19, 2022: I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to calculate it. Let's think. January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nBut maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the fact that March 19 is a Saturday. So March 19 is Saturday. Then March 20 is Sunday, March 21 is Monday, and so on.\n\nThe period is from March 19 to May 8, inclusive. Let me calculate the total days first. Let's break it down into months.\n\nMarch has 31 days. So from March 19 to March 31: that's 31 - 19 + 1 = 13 days (including both ends). Then April has 30 days, and May 8 is the 8th day of May. So total days would be 13 (March) + 30 (April) + 8 (May) = 51 days total. Wait, but wait: March 19 to March 31 is 13 days. Then April is 30 days, and May 1 to May 8 is 8 days. So total is 13 + 30 + 8 = 51 days. But wait, the original period is from March 19 to May 8 inclusive. So that's correct.\n\nNow, total days: 51 days. Now, need to subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period.\n\nBut since March 19 is a Saturday, let's see how many Saturdays and Sundays there are in this period.\n\nStarting from March 19 (Saturday), March 20 (Sunday), March 21 (Monday), March 22 (Tuesday), March 23 (Wednesday), March 24 (Thursday), March 25 (Friday), March 26 (Saturday), March 27 (Sunday), March 28 (Monday), March 29 (Tuesday), March 30 (Wednesday), March 31 (Thursday). So March has 13 days. Let's count the weekends in March:\n\nMarch 19 (Sat), March 20 (Sun), March 26 (Sat), March 27 (Sun). That's 4 weekends in March. Wait, March 19 is Saturday, then March 20 is Sunday. Then March 26 is Saturday again, March 27 Sunday. Then March 28 is Monday. So in March, there are 4 weekend days (2 Saturdays and 2 Sundays). Wait, March 19, 20, 26, 27. That's four days. So 4 weekend days in March.\n\nThen April. April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Let me check that. Wait, March 31, 2022 was a Thursday. So April 1 is Friday. So April 1 is Friday, April 2 Saturday, April 3 Sunday, etc. So in April, each week has 2 Saturdays and 2 Sundays. April has 30 days. So 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks would have 4*2=8 Saturdays and 8 Sundays. Then the remaining 2 days are April 29 (Saturday) and April 30 (Sunday). Wait, no. Wait, April 1 is Friday. So April 1 (Fri), 2 (Sat), 3 (Sun), 4 (Mon), etc. So the last two days of April would be April 29 (Saturday) and April 30 (Sunday). So that's 2 more weekends. So total in April: 8 + 2 = 10 weekend days? Wait, no. Wait, 4 weeks (28 days) would have 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. Then the remaining 2 days (April 29 and 30) are Saturday and Sunday. So total 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays? Wait, no. Wait, 4 weeks is 28 days. So 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays. Then the next two days are Saturday and Sunday. So total 5 Saturdays and 5 Sundays. So that's 10 weekend days in April.\n\nThen May. May 1, 2022 is a Monday. Because April 30 is a Sunday. So May 1 is Monday. Then May 2 is Tuesday, May 3 Wednesday, May 4 Thursday, May 5 Friday, May 6 Saturday, May 7 Sunday, May 8 Monday. So the period ends on May 8, which is a Monday. So in May, the weekend days are May 6 (Saturday) and May 7 (Sunday). So that's 2 weekend days in May.\n\nSo total weekend days in the entire period: March (4) + April (10) + May (2) = 16 weekend days.\n\nTotal days: 51. So business days would be 51 - 16 = 35.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of Mondays to Fridays in each month.\n\nMarch: March 19 is Saturday. So the first business day is March 21 (Monday). Let's count the business days in March.\n\nMarch 19 (Sat) is excluded. March 20 (Sun) excluded. March 21 (Mon) is included. Then March 22 (Tue), 23 (Wed), 24 (Thu), 25 (Fri). Then March 26 (Sat) excluded, March 27 (Sun) excluded. March 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), 31 (Thu). So in March, from March 21 to March 31, that's 11 days. Let's count the business days: March 21-25 (5 days), March 28-31 (4 days). Total 5+4=9 business days in March.\n\nWait, but March 21 is Monday, March 22 Tuesday, 23 Wednesday, 24 Thursday, 25 Friday. That's 5 days. Then March 28 is Monday again, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday, 31 Thursday. That's 4 days. So total 9 business days in March.\n\nApril: April 1 is Friday. So April 1 is Friday, 2 Saturday, 3 Sunday, 4 Monday, etc. So business days in April would be all days except Saturdays and Sundays. April has 30 days. So 30 days minus 10 weekend days (as calculated earlier) equals 20 business days. Wait, but if April has 30 days, and 10 weekend days, then 30-10=20 business days. But let me check. April 1 is Friday. So the first business day is April 1 (Friday), then April 2 (Sat) excluded, April 3 (Sun) excluded. Then April 4 (Mon) is business. So in April, the business days would be 30 days minus 10 weekend days (as calculated earlier) = 20. So 20 business days in April.\n\nMay: May 1 is Monday. May 8 is Monday. So May 1-8 is 8 days. The weekends in May are May 6 (Sat) and May 7 (Sun). So business days in May are 8 - 2 = 6 days.\n\nSo total business days: March (9) + April (20) + May (6) = 35. That matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 35.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because March 19 is included. Wait, the original period is from March 19 to May 8 inclusive. So March 19 is Saturday, which is excluded. March 20 is Sunday, excluded. March 21 is Monday, included. So March has 9 business days. April has 20, May has 6. Total 35. So the answer is 35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. Let's calculate the total days (51) minus the number of weekends (16) gives 35. So that's consistent. So I think 35 is the correct answer.", "35"], [124, "Determine if the year 2043 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2043 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2043 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2043 divided by 4. 4 times 510 is 2040, so 2043 minus 2040 is 3. That leaves a remainder of 3, so 2043 is not divisible by 4. Wait, that seems straightforward. If it's not divisible by 4, then it can't be a leap year, right? But maybe I should double-check. Let me add 4 to 2040 to get 2044, which is a leap year. So 2043 is one year before that, so definitely not divisible by 4. \n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if it's a century year. Century years are every 100 years, like 2000, 2100, etc. 2043 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So the second condition about 400 doesn't apply here. So since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the division. Let me check again. 4 times 500 is 2000. 2043 minus 2000 is 43. 43 divided by 4 is 10.75. So yeah, 2043 divided by 4 is 510.75, which isn't a whole number. So definitely not divisible by 4. \n\nSo the answer should be No. Because the first condition for a leap year isn't met. The century year rule isn't needed here since 2043 isn't a century year. Therefore, 2043 is not a leap year.", "No"], [124, "Count the occurrences of Monday from Friday, August 5 to Monday, August 29, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

Both dates are included, so I need to check if they are Mondays and count them.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week August 5, 2022, was. Let me recall that August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I should check that again. Wait, I think August 5, 2022, was a Friday. Let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or some method to calculate.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that August 5 is a Friday. Let me think. If August 5 is a Friday, then August 6 is Saturday, 7 is Sunday, 8 is Monday. So the first Monday in this period would be August 8, 2022. Then the next Mondays would be every 7 days. Let's list them out.\n\nStarting from August 5 (Friday), the next days:\n\nAugust 5: Friday\nAugust 6: Saturday\nAugust 7: Sunday\nAugust 8: Monday (first Monday)\nAugust 9: Tuesday\nAugust 10: Wednesday\nAugust 11: Thursday\nAugust 12: Friday\nAugust 13: Saturday\nAugust 14: Sunday\nAugust 15: Monday (second Monday)\nAugust 16: Tuesday\nAugust 17: Wednesday\nAugust 18: Thursday\nAugust 19: Friday\nAugust 20: Saturday\nAugust 21: Sunday\nAugust 22: Monday (third Monday)\nAugust 23: Tuesday\nAugust 24: Wednesday\nAugust 25: Thursday\nAugust 26: Friday\nAugust 27: Saturday\nAugust 28: Sunday\nAugust 29: Monday (fourth Monday)\n\nWait, so August 29 is a Monday. So the Mondays in this period are August 8, 15, 22, and 29. That's four Mondays. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nWait, August 5 is Friday. So the first Monday is August 8. Then adding 7 days each time: 8 +7=15, 15+7=22, 22+7=29. Then 29+7=36, which is September 1, which is outside the range. So from August 5 to August 29 inclusive, there are four Mondays.

Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1950 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 1950. First, divide 1950 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 487 is 1948, so 1950 minus 1948 is 2. That means 1950 divided by 4 is 487.5, which isn't a whole number. So 1950 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check that division. Let me add 4 to 1948: 1948 + 4 is 1952, so 1950 is two years after 1948, which is not a multiple of 4. So yes, 1950 isn't divisible by 4.

Name the day of the week in full.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week May 16, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know the day of the week for. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 16, 2022 is a certain number of days away from a known date. Let's see. Let's take July 4, 2022 as a reference. July 4 is 20 days after May 16. Wait, May has 31 days, so from May 16 to May 31 is 15 days. Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days gets to July 1. Then July 4 is 3 days after July 1. So total days from May 16 to July 4 is 15 + 30 + 3 = 48 days. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, May 16 to May 31 is 15 days (since 31-16=15). Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days gets to July 1. Then July 4 is 3 days after July 1. So total days from May 16 to July 4 is 15 + 30 + 3 = 48 days. So if July 4 is a Monday, then May 16 would be 48 days earlier. \n\nNow, since 48 days is 6 weeks and 6 days (because 6*7=42, 48-42=6). So going back 6 days from Monday. Let's count: Monday minus 6 days. Monday minus 1 day is Sunday, minus 2 is Saturday, minus 3 is Friday, minus 4 is Thursday, minus 5 is Wednesday, minus 6 is Tuesday. So if July 4 is Monday, then May 16 would be a Tuesday. But wait, I need to confirm if July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 1 + 15 days is May 16. So 15 days later. 15 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 1 day. So if May 1 is Sunday, then May 1 + 7 days is Sunday again, then another 7 days is Sunday again, so May 15 is Sunday. Then May 16 would be Monday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. So which one is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again. If May 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, and May 16 would be Monday. But earlier, using July 4 as a reference, I thought May 16 was Tuesday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. Let's think about another way. For example, I know that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, I think July 4, 2021 was a Sunday. Wait, maybe I need to check a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, I can use an online calendar or a known reference. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think. I remember that in 2022, May 1 was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If May 1, 2022 is Sunday, then May 1 + 7 days is May 8 (Sunday), May 15 (Sunday), May 16 (Monday). So that would make May 16 a Monday. But earlier, when I calculated using July 4 as a reference, I thought it was Tuesday. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the days between May 16 and July 4. Let me recalculate that. May 16 to May 31 is 15 days (since 31-16=15). Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days gets to July 1. Then July 4 is 3 days after July 1. So total days from May 16 to July 4 is 15 + 30 + 3 = 48 days. So 48 days later. If July 4 is a Monday, then May 16 is 48 days before. 48 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 6 days. So going back 6 days from Monday. Monday minus 6 days is Tuesday. But if May 16 is Tuesday, then May 1 would be 15 days before May 16. 15 days is 2 weeks and 1 day. So if May 16 is Tuesday, then May 1 would be Tuesday minus 1 day, which is Monday. But that contradicts the earlier assumption that May 1 was Sunday. So there's a problem here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe July 4, 2022 was not a Monday. Let me think again. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 16 is Monday. Then June 1 is 15 days after May 1, which is 2 weeks and 1 day, so June 1 is Sunday. Then June 8 is Sunday, June 15 is Sunday, June 22 is Sunday, June 29 is Sunday. July 6 is Sunday. Then July 4 is 2 days before July 6, so July 4 would be Friday. Wait, that would mean July 4 is Friday. But that contradicts the previous assumption. So if May 1 is Sunday, then July 4 is Friday. Then May 16 is Monday. So that would mean that the calculation of 48 days between May 16 and July 4 is correct. So if May 16 is Monday, then July 4 is 48 days later, which is 6 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, if May 16 is Monday, then adding 48 days would be Monday + 48 days. 48 divided by 7 is 6 weeks (42 days) and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. But according to the other calculation, July 4 is Friday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption that May 1 is Sunday might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me try again. Let's take May 1 as Sunday. Then May 1 is Sunday. May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 16 is Monday. Then June 1 is 15 days after May 1, which is 2 weeks and 1 day. So June 1 is Sunday. Then June 8 is Sunday, June 15 is Sunday, June 22 is Sunday, June 29 is Sunday. July 6 is Sunday. July 4 is two days before July 6, so July 4 is Friday. So that would mean that July 4 is Friday. But if May 16 is Monday, then adding 48 days (May 16 to July 4) would be 48 days. 48 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. But according to the other calculation, July 4 is Friday. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, one of the assumptions must be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe May 1 is not Sunday. Let me check another way. Let's think about the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me confirm. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, January 15 is Saturday, January 22 is Saturday, January 29 is Saturday. February 5 is Saturday. February 12 is Saturday, February 19 is Saturday, February 26 is Saturday. March 6 is Saturday. March 13 is Saturday, March 20 is Saturday, March 27 is Saturday. April 3 is Saturday, April 10 is Saturday, April 17 is Saturday, April 24 is Saturday, May 1 is Saturday. Wait, that would mean May 1, 2022 is a Saturday. But that contradicts the previous assumption that May 1 was Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then May 1 would be 122 days later (since January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, so 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 = 120 days. Wait, January 1 to April 30 is 120 days. Then May 1 is 121 days after January 1. Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is day 1. Then January 1 + 31 days is February 1. Then February 1 + 28 days is March 1. March 1 + 31 days is April 1. April 1 + 30 days is May 1. So total days from January 1 to May 1 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 = 120 days. So May 1 is 120 days after January 1. 120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Saturday, then May 1 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. Wait, that would mean May 1 is Sunday. But earlier calculation suggested that if January 1 is Saturday, then May 1 is Saturday. There's a contradiction here. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. March has 31 days, so March 1 to March 31 is 31 days. April has 30 days. So from January 1 to May 1 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 30 is 120 days. So May 1 is 120 days after January 1. 120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks (119 days) and 1 day. So if January 1 is Saturday, then May 1 is Saturday + 1 day = Sunday. So that would mean May 1 is Sunday. Then May 16 is 15 days later, which is 2 weeks and 1 day. So May 16 would be Sunday + 1 day = Monday. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought that January 1, 2022 was Saturday, then May 1 is Sunday. Then May 16 is Monday. But when I calculated the days between May 16 and July 4, I thought that July 4 was Friday. But according to that, if May 16 is Monday, then July 4 is 48 days later. 48 days is 6 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. But according to the other calculation, July 4 is Friday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I can check by looking at some known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. That seems correct. So if that's the case, then May 1, 2022 is Sunday. Then May 16 is Monday. \n\nBut then, if July 4 is 48 days after May 16, then July 4 would be 48 days after Monday. 48 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. But according to the other calculation, July 4 is Friday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the days between May 16 and July 4. Let me do that again. May 16 to May 31 is 15 days (since 31 - 16 = 15). Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days gets to July 1. Then July 4 is 3 days after July 1. So total days from May 16 to July 4 is 15 + 30 + 3 = 48 days. That's correct. So if May 16 is Monday, then July 4 is 48 days later, which is 6 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. But according to the other calculation, July 4 is Friday. So that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that May 1 is Sunday. Let me check another way. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 16 is Monday. Then June 1 is 15 days after May 1, which is 2 weeks and 1 day. So June 1 is Sunday. Then June 8 is Sunday, June 15 is Sunday, June 22 is Sunday, June 29 is Sunday. July 6 is Sunday. July 4 is two days before July 6, so July 4 is Friday. So that would mean July 4 is Friday. But according to the other calculation, July 4 is Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in one of the calculations. Let me check the days between May 16 and July 4 again. May 16 to May 31 is 15 days. Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days gets to July 1. Then July 4 is 3 days after July 1. So total is 15 + 30 + 3 = 48 days. That's correct. So if May 16 is Monday, then July 4 is 48 days later. 48 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 6 days. So Monday + 6 days is Sunday. But according to the other calculation, July 4 is Friday. So this is a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that May 1 is Sunday. Let me check another date. For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that with another method. If January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then May 1 is 120 days later. 120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks and 1 day. So Saturday + 1 day is Sunday. So that's correct. So May 1 is Sunday. Then May 16 is Monday. \n\nBut then July 4 is 48 days later, which would be Sunday. But according to the other calculation, July 4 is Friday. So where is the mistake here? \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the days between May 16 and July 4. Let me count the days step by step. \n\nMay 16 to May 31: 31 - 16 = 15 days. So May 16 is day 0, May 17 is day 1, ..., May 31 is day 15. \n\nThen June has 30 days, so from June 1 to June 30 is 30 days. So adding 30 days to May 31 (day 15) gives June 30 (day 15 + 30 = day 45). Then July 1 is day 46, July 2 is 47, July 3 is 48, July 4 is 49. Wait, that's 49 days from May 16. Wait, that's different from the previous calculation. Wait, this suggests that May 16 to July 4 is 49 days, not 48. So where did I go wrong before?\n\nAh! I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recount. From May 16 to May 31 is 15 days (inclusive of May 16? Or exclusive?). Wait, if May 16 is day 0, then May 17 is day 1, ..., May 31 is day 15. So that's 15 days later."], [124, "On which weekday did April 5, 2022 fall? State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week April 5, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, let me check that. If I remember correctly, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. \n\nWait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me verify. If 2021 started on a Saturday, adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would mean that 2022 starts on a Sunday. So January 1, 2022 is a Sunday. \n\nNow, April 5th is 3 months after January 1. Let's count the days. January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since we start counting from the 1st). Then February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year), March has 31 days. So adding those up: 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) = 90 days. Wait, but April 5th is 5 days into April. So total days from January 1 to April 5 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 5 (Apr) = 95 days. Wait, no. Wait, January 1 is day 1. So January 1 is day 1, January 2 is day 2, etc. So to get to April 5, we need to add 31 (days in January) + 28 (days in February) + 31 (days in March) + 5 (days in April up to the 5th). Wait, no. Wait, if I start from January 1, then January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 59 + 31 = 90 days. Then April 5 is 5 days into April, so total days from January 1 to April 5 is 90 + 5 = 95 days. \n\nSo if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then 95 days later would be April 5. Now, since 7 days in a week, we can divide 95 by 7 to find the number of weeks and days. 95 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 4 days (since 13*7=91, 95-91=4). So adding 4 days to Sunday. Sunday + 1 day is Monday, +2 is Tuesday, +3 is Wednesday, +4 is Thursday. So April 5, 2022 would be a Thursday. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 being a Sunday is correct. Let me check another way. For example, I know that April 5, 2021 was a Tuesday. Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I can check a known date. For example, April 1, 2022. If I can find that, then adding 4 days would get to April 5. Let me think. If I remember that April 1, 2022 was a Friday, then April 5 would be a Tuesday. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Hmm, so there's a problem here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check another approach. Let's use an online calendar or a known reference. Wait, since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think again. \n\nAnother way: Let's take a known date. For example, I know that March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should use a different method. Let's use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me count the days from January 1 to April 5 again. \n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is day 1 (Sunday). Then January 8 is also a Sunday. January 15, 22, 29. Then February 5, 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. So April 5 is 5 days after March 31. Wait, March 31 is a Thursday (since March 26 is a Saturday, March 27 is Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday, 31 Thursday). So March 31 is a Thursday. Then April 1 is Friday, April 2 Saturday, 3 Sunday, 4 Monday, 5 Tuesday. Wait, that would mean April 5 is a Tuesday. But earlier calculation said Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nSo where is the mistake? Let me check again. If January 1 is Sunday, then January 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday, 15, 22, 29. Then February 5 is Sunday (since 29 + 7 = 36, which is February 5). Then February 12, 19, 26. March 5 is Sunday (February 26 + 7 = March 5). March 12, 19, 26. April 2 is Sunday (March 26 + 7 = April 2). Then April 9 is Sunday, 16, 23, 30. So April 5 is 3 days before April 8 (Sunday). So April 5 would be Thursday. Wait, but according to the other method, March 31 is Thursday, so April 5 is Tuesday. Which is correct?\n\nWait, if March 31 is Thursday, then April 1 is Friday, 2 Saturday, 3 Sunday, 4 Monday, 5 Tuesday. So that would be Tuesday. But according to the other method, April 5 is Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Sunday is wrong. Let me check again. Maybe I mixed up the years. Let me think about 2021. If I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, that would make sense. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then let's recalculate. \n\nSo January 1 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. February 5 is Saturday (29 + 7 = 36, which is February 5). February 12, 19, 26. March 5 is Saturday (February 26 + 7 = March 5). March 12, 19, 26. April 2 is Saturday (March 26 + 7 = April 2). Then April 9 is Saturday, 16, 23, 30. So April 5 is 3 days before April 8 (Saturday), so April 5 would be Wednesday. Wait, but that's conflicting again. \n\nAlternatively, if March 31 is a Thursday, then April 5 is Tuesday. But if March 5 is Saturday, then March 12 is Saturday, March 19 is Saturday, March 26 is Saturday. Then April 2 is Saturday. So April 2 is Saturday, so April 5 is Tuesday. That would be correct. So if March 26 is Saturday, then March 26 + 7 = April 2 (Saturday). Then April 2 is Saturday, so April 5 is Tuesday. So that would mean April 5 is Tuesday. \n\nBut earlier calculation using the days from January 1 to April 5 was 95 days. If January 1 is Saturday, then 95 days later would be 95 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 4 days. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. But that contradicts the other method. So there's a problem here. \n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 is wrong. Let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, April 5, 2022. If I can recall that April 5, 2022 was a Tuesday, then that would be correct. But I need to verify. Alternatively, I can use the fact that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if April 1 is Friday, then April 5 is Tuesday. That would make sense. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that March 14, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If March 14 is Monday, then March 15 is Tuesday, 16 Wednesday, 17 Thursday, 18 Friday, 19 Saturday, 20 Sunday, 21 Monday, 22 Tuesday, 23 Wednesday, 24 Thursday, 25 Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday, 28 Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday, 31 Thursday. So March 31 is Thursday. Then April 1 is Friday, 2 Saturday, 3 Sunday, 4 Monday, 5 Tuesday. So April 5 is Tuesday. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Tuesday. But why did the previous calculation with January 1 being Saturday give a different result? Because if January 1 is Saturday, then 95 days later is 95 mod 7 = 95 - 13*7 = 95 - 91 = 4. So Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. But that contradicts the other method. So there must be an error in the assumption that January 1, 2022 is Saturday. \n\nWait, maybe I got the day of the week for January 1, 2022 wrong. Let me check again. If I know that March 14, 2022 was a Monday, then March 14 is Monday. Let's count back to January 1. March 14 is 59 days after January 1 (31 days in January, 28 in February, 14 in March). Wait, no. January has 31 days, so January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days, so up to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. Then March 14 is 14 days into March, so total days from January 1 to March 14 is 59 + 14 = 73 days. So 73 days from January 1 is March 14. If March 14 is Monday, then 73 days later is Monday. 73 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 3 days. So January 1 would be Monday minus 3 days, which is Friday. Wait, that would mean January 1, 2022 is a Friday. But that contradicts the previous assumption. \n\nWait, if March 14 is Monday, then January 1 is 73 days before that. 73 divided by 7 is 10 weeks (70 days) and 3 days. So 73 days before Monday is 3 days before Monday, which is Friday. So January 1, 2022 is a Friday. Then, let's check the days again. \n\nIf January 1 is Friday, then January 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. February 5 is Friday (29 + 7 = 36, which is February 5). February 12, 19, 26. March 5 is Friday (February 26 + 7 = March 5). March 12, 19, 26. April 2 is Friday (March 26 + 7 = April 2). Then April 9 is Friday, 16, 23, 30. So April 5 is 3 days before April 8 (Friday), which is Tuesday. So that matches the previous conclusion. \n\nSo the correct day is Tuesday. Therefore, the initial mistake was in assuming that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday or Saturday. The correct day is Friday.", "Tuesday"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the fourth Wednesday in November 2022. Reply with the numerical value.

Hmm, first, maybe I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that.

So the fourth Wednesday would be the 23rd? Wait, let me count again. First Wednesday is 2nd, second is 9th, third is 16th, fourth is 23rd. Then the fifth is 30th. So the fourth one is the 23rd. But wait, November has 30 days. So 23rd is a Wednesday. So the answer should be 23. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first day. Let me check again. Maybe I should verify the actual calendar for November 2022.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method. Let's check online or recall that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. So the first Wednesday is the 2nd. Then adding 7 days each time. So 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. So the fourth is 23. Therefore, the answer is 23.

I remember that sometimes you can use known dates to work this out.

I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think again. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no, because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day.

July 4, 2022: if I count backwards, July 4 is a Monday. Then, if I go back to May, let's see. Let's count the days between May 13 and July 4. May has 31 days, so from May 13 to May 31 is 18 days. Then June has 30 days, so adding 30 days, and then July 4 is 4 days.

If May 1 is Sunday, then May 13 is 12 days later. 12 days later would be 1 week (7 days) plus 5 days. So Sunday + 5 days is Friday. So May 13 would be Friday.

For example, I know that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If April 1 is Friday, then May 1 would be 30 days later. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days.

For example, I know that May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. If that's correct, then May 13 is 12 days later. 12 days is 1 week (7 days) and 5 days. So Sunday + 5 days is Friday. So May 13 would be Friday. But if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. So May 13 is 12 days after May 1, which is 1 week and 5 days. So Sunday + 5 days is Friday. So that would make May 13 a Friday. But earlier when I thought that March 14 was Monday, and then May 2 was Monday, that would make May 13 a Thursday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the actual calendar. Wait, I can't do that, but maybe I can use another method. Let me think about the day of the week for a specific date in 2022. For example, I know that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. Then June 5 is Sunday. So June 1 would be a Friday. But if June 1 is Friday, then June 8 is Friday, June 15 is Friday, June 22 is Friday, June 29 is Friday. July 6 is Friday, July 13 is Friday, July 20 is Friday, July 27 is Friday. So July 4 would be 3 days before July 7, which is Friday. So July 4 would be Tuesday. But if May 13 is Friday, then May 13 is Friday, and July 4 is Tuesday. But that would mean that the number of days between May 13 and July 4 is 52 days. 52 days is 7 weeks, so same day. But if May 13 is Friday and July 4 is Tuesday, that's not possible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So one of the assumptions must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe May 1 is not a Sunday. Let me check again. If I know that March 14, 2022 was a Monday, then March 21 is Monday, March 28 is Monday. April 4 is Monday, April 11 is Monday, April 18 is Monday, April 25 is Monday. May 2 is Monday. So May 2 is Monday. Then May 1 is Sunday. So that would make May 1 a Sunday. Then May 13 is 12 days later, which is Friday. But then July 4 is 52 days later, which would be same day. But if May 13 is Friday, then July 4 would be Friday. But according to the previous calculation, July 4 would be Tuesday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption about March 14 being Monday. Maybe March 14, 2022 was not a Monday. Let me think again. If May 2 is Monday, then April 25 is Monday. April 25 is Monday. Then April 18 is Monday, April 11 is Monday, April 4 is Monday. March 28 is Monday, March 21 is Monday, March 14 is Monday. So that would make March 14 a Monday. But if that's correct, then May 2 is Monday, and May 1 is Sunday. Then May 13 is Friday. But then July 4 would be 52 days later, which is same day. So July 4 would be Friday. But according to the previous calculation, if June 1 is Friday, then July 4 is Tuesday. So that's conflicting. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the June 1 calculation.\n\nWait, if May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. Then June 5 is Sunday. So June 1 is Friday. Then June 8 is Friday, June 15 is Friday, June 22 is Friday, June 29 is Friday. July 6 is Friday, July 13 is Friday, July 20 is Friday, July 27 is Friday. So July 4 is 3 days before July 7, which is Friday. So July 4 is Tuesday. But if May 13 is Friday, then July 4 is 52 days later, which should be same day. But that's not the case. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So one of the assumptions is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe May 1 is not Sunday. Let me try another approach. Let's use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 would start on a Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday.

February 5 is Tuesday, February 12 is Tuesday, February 19 is Tuesday, February 26 is Tuesday. March 6 is Tuesday, March 13 is Tuesday, March 20 is Tuesday, March 27 is Tuesday. April 3 is Tuesday, April 10 is Tuesday, April 17 is Tuesday, April 24 is Tuesday, May 1 is Tuesday. Wait, that would make May 1, 2022 a Tuesday. Then May 1 is Tuesday. Then May 8 is Tuesday, May 15 is Tuesday, May 22 is Tuesday, May 29 is Tuesday. So May 13 is 12 days after May 1. 12 days is 1 week and 5 days. So Tuesday + 5 days is Sunday. So May 13 would be Sunday. But that contradicts the previous calculation where March 14 was Monday. So now I'm really confused.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 being a Tuesday is wrong. Maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the day of the week for a specific date in 2022. For example, I know that May 13, 2022 is a Friday. But how can I confirm that? Alternatively, I can use the fact that May 13, 2022 is the 135th day of the year. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. So January has 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31. So up to April 30, that's 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 = 120 days. Then May 13 is 120 + 13 = 133 days. Wait, no, May 1 is day 131 (since 31+28+31+30=120, so May 1 is day 121? Wait, no. Wait, January has 31 days, so January 1 is day 1, January 31 is day 31. February has 28 days, so February 28 is day 31+28=59. March has 31 days, so March 31 is day 59+31=90. April has 30 days, so April 30 is day 90+30=120. Then May 1 is day 121. So May 13 is day 121 + 12 = day 133. Now, if I can find the day of the week for day 133, that would help. \n\nBut how? Well, if I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then day 1 is Sunday. Then day 133 would be 132 days later. 132 divided by 7 is 18 weeks and 6 days. So 132 days later is 18 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday + 6 days is Saturday. But that would mean May 13 is Saturday. But that contradicts previous calculations. So now I'm really confused. \n\nAlternatively, if January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, then day 1 is Tuesday. Then day 133 would be 132 days later. 132 divided by 7 is 18 weeks and 6 days. So Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. So May 13 would be Monday. But that's conflicting with other calculations. \n\nThis suggests that I need to find the correct day of the week for January 1, 2022. Let me try to find that. I know that January 1, 2021 was a Monday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be 1 day later, which is Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Therefore, day 1 is Tuesday. Then day 133 is 132 days later. 132 divided by 7 is 18 weeks and 6 days. So Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. So May 13, 2022 would be Monday. But earlier calculations suggested different days. \n\nBut if May 1 is day 121, which is 120 days after January 1. 120 days is 17 weeks and 1 day. So Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday. So May 1 is Wednesday. Then May 13 is 12 days later. 12 days is 1 week and 5 days. So Wednesday +"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the fourth Tuesday in January 2022.

I need to find the fourth Tuesday in January 2022 and give the day of the month as a number. If it doesn't exist, I should answer -1. Hmm, first, I should figure out what day of the week January 1, 2022 was. Wait, I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. Oh right, because 2022 started on a Saturday. So January 1 is Saturday.\n\nSo, if January 1 is Saturday, then the first Tuesday would be the 3rd. Because Saturday is day 1, Sunday 2, Monday 3, Tuesday 4? Wait, no.

So I need to count all the Saturdays between those two dates, including both the start and end dates if they are Saturdays.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week each date is. The start date is Sunday, August 28, 2022. Let me confirm that. Wait, August 28, 2022, was a Sunday. Then the next day, August 29, would be a Monday, and so on. The end date is Thursday, September 8, 2022. So I need to check each day from August 28 to September 8, inclusive, and count how many Saturdays there are.\n\nLet me list out the dates and their corresponding days. Starting with August 28 (Sunday). Then August 29 (Monday), August 30 (Tuesday), August 31 (Wednesday), September 1 (Thursday), September 2 (Friday), September 3 (Saturday), September 4 (Sunday), September 5 (Monday), September 6 (Tuesday), September 7 (Wednesday), September 8 (Thursday).\n\nWait, so the dates from August 28 to September 8 inclusive are 12 days total.

Wait, actually, the total number of days between August 28 and September 8 inclusive is (September 8 - August 28) + 1. Let me calculate that. August has 31 days, so from August 28 to August 31 is 4 days (28,29,30,31). Then September 1 to September 8 is 8 days. So total is 4 + 8 = 12 days.

For example, August 28, 2022. Let me think of some known dates. For example, July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Then July 5 was Tuesday, and so on. Let me count. July has 31 days. So July 4 is Monday. July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday, August 1 is Monday. So August 1, 2022 was a Monday.

December 30, 2022 is a Friday. Then December 31 is a Saturday. So the period includes two days: Friday and Saturday.\n\nNow, business days are Monday-Friday. So Friday is a business day, but Saturday is not. Since the question says inclusive of both dates, I need to count both days but exclude any weekends.\n\nSo, December 30 is a Friday, which is a business day.

So the first Wednesday is April 27, 2022.\n\nThen, each subsequent Wednesday would be 7 days later.

Let me check if there are any more Wednesdays between April 27 and May 18. Let's count the days between April 27 and May 18.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 27 to April 30 is 3 days (27, 28, 29, 30). Then May 1 to May 18 is 18 days. So total days from April 27 to May 18 is 3 + 18 = 21 days. 21 divided by 7 is 3 weeks.

And I need to reply with just the weekday name. Alright, so I need to figure out the day of the week for March 26, given that January 1st is a Tuesday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are there from January 1st to March 26th. Let me break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since the first day is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question is about the first day of the year being a Tuesday. So if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year? Or maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year? Wait, but maybe the problem is in a specific year. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. Because if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days, which would affect the total number of days. But since the problem doesn't mention a leap year, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year. Let me check that.\n\nSo, assuming it's not a leap year, February has 28 days. So from January 1st to March 26th would be 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 26 (March) days? Wait, no. Wait, the total days from January 1st to March 26th is (31 days in January) + (28 days in February) + 26 days in March? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 1, then January 31st is day 31. Then February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 31 + 28 = 59. Then March 1st is day 60. So March 26th would be 60 + 25 = 85 days later? Wait, because March 1st is day 60, so March 26th is 25 days after March 1st (since 26-1=25). So total days from January 1st to March 26th is 85 days. Wait, but if I count from January 1st (day 1) to March 26th, that's 85 days. But if I want to find the number of days between January 1st and March 26th, inclusive, then it's 85 days. But when calculating the day of the week, we need to find how many days have passed since the first day. So if January 1st is day 0 (Tuesday), then March 26th is 85 days later. Wait, but if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, etc. So the total number of days between January 1st and March 26th is 85 days. Wait, but if I count from January 1st (day 0) to March 26th, that's 85 days. So the number of days between them is 85. So to find the day of the week, we can take 85 modulo 7. Because the days of the week repeat every 7 days.\n\nSo 85 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7*12=84, so 85-84=1. So 85 mod 7 is 1. So that means March 26th is 1 day after Tuesday. So Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday. Wait, but wait. Wait, if January 1st is Tuesday, then adding 1 day would be Wednesday. So March 26th would be Wednesday? But wait, let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since day 1 is the first day). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March 26th is 26 days into March. Wait, but if I'm starting from January 1st, then the total days from January 1st to March 26th is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 26 (Mar) = 85 days. But wait, that's including both the start and end dates? Wait, no. Wait, if you have January 1st as day 1, then January 2nd is day 2, etc. So the number of days between January 1st and March 26th is 85 days. But if you want to find how many days have passed since January 1st, then March 26th is 85 days after January 1st. So the number of days between them is 85. So 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks and 1 day. So that would mean that March 26th is 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. But wait, let me check again. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days for each month. Let's see:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 8 is Tuesday again, and so on. Let's see, January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Wednesday, January 31 is Thursday. Then February 1 is Friday. Then February has 28 days, so February 28 is a Friday + 27 days. Wait, 28 days is 4 weeks, so February 28 would be a Friday again. Then March 1 is Saturday. Then March 1 is Saturday. Then March 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. March 26 is 26th, which is 26-1=25 days after March 1. So March 1 is Saturday. March 26 is 25 days later. 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So 3 weeks later is Saturday again, plus 4 days. Saturday + 4 days is Wednesday. So March 26 is Wednesday. So that matches the previous calculation. So the answer is Wednesday.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1 as Tuesday.\n\nJanuary 1: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 2: Wednesday\n\n...\n\nJanuary 7: Monday\n\nJanuary 8: Tuesday\n\nSo every 7 days, it cycles. So January 1 is Tuesday, then January 8 is Tuesday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Wednesday, 31 is Thursday. Then February 1 is Friday. February 1 is Friday. Then February 8 is Friday, 15, 22, 29. Then March 1 is Saturday. March 1 is Saturday. Then March 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. So March 26 is 26th.

Then March 15 is Saturday, March 22 is Saturday, March 29 is Saturday. Then March 26 is three days before March 29. March 29 is Saturday, so March 28 is Friday, March 27 is Thursday, March 26 is Wednesday. So that's correct. So March 26 is Wednesday.

The question is asking how many Wednesdays there are from Friday, December 2, 2022, to Wednesday, December 7, 2022, inclusive. So I need to count all the Wednesdays between those two dates, including both the start and end dates.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week each date falls on. Wait, the start date is a Friday, December 2, 2022. Then the next day is Saturday, December 3, 2022. Then Sunday, December 4. Then Monday, December 5. Then Tuesday, December 6. And then Wednesday, December 7. So the dates are:\n\n- Dec 2: Friday\n- Dec 3: Saturday\n- Dec 4: Sunday\n- Dec 5: Monday\n- Dec 6: Tuesday\n- Dec 7: Wednesday\n\nSo the range includes from Friday the 2nd up to Wednesday the 7th. Now, I need to check which of these dates are Wednesdays. Let's list them out:\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\n- Dec 2: Friday \u2192 not Wednesday\n- Dec 3: Saturday \u2192 no\n- Dec 4: Sunday \u2192 no\n- Dec 5: Monday \u2192 no\n- Dec 6: Tuesday \u2192 no\n- Dec 7: Wednesday \u2192 yes\n\nSo only December 7th is a Wednesday. Wait, but wait, is that all? Let me check again. The start date is Friday the 2nd, so the first Wednesday after that would be the 7th. But wait, maybe there's another Wednesday in between? Let me count the days.\n\nFrom Dec 2 (Friday) to Dec 7 (Wednesday) is 6 days. Let's count each day:\n\n1. Dec 2: Friday\n2. Dec 3: Saturday\n3. Dec 4: Sunday\n4. Dec 5: Monday\n5. Dec 6: Tuesday\n6. Dec 7: Wednesday\n\nSo that's six days total. The only Wednesday in this period is the 7th. Therefore, the answer should be 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if the dates are inclusive. The problem says \"inclusive of both dates,\" so both the start and end dates are included. But since the start date is a Friday, and the end date is a Wednesday, there's only one Wednesday in between. So the count is 1. I think that's correct. Let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I calculate the number of days between the two dates. From Dec 2 to Dec 7 is 6 days. So if I divide 6 by 7, the number of weeks, but since it's only 6 days, there's one full week? No, wait, 6 days is less than a week. So there's one Wednesday in that period.

The problem is: If today is Thursday, February 3, 2022, what day of the week will it be in 84 days? And I need to give the full weekday name. Alright, so I need to figure out what day of the week it will be 84 days from February 3, 2022.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 84 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that calculation. 84 divided by 7 is 12. So that's exactly 12 weeks. Hmm, so if I add 12 weeks to February 3, 2022, that should be the same day of the week, right? Because 12 weeks is 84 days, and each week has 7 days. So adding 12 weeks would just be adding 84 days, which would land on the same day of the week.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, the starting date is February 3, 2022. Let me think. 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're adding 84 days, maybe I need to check if the date calculation is correct. Wait, but the question is only about the day of the week, not the actual date. So even if the date changes, the day of the week would be the same as adding 84 days. Because 84 is a multiple of 7. So regardless of how many days are in each month, adding 84 days would just be 12 weeks, so the same day of the week.\n\nBut maybe I should verify this. Let me think. For example, if today is Thursday, then adding 7 days is Thursday again. Adding 14 days is also Thursday. So 84 days is 12 times 7, so yes, it should be Thursday again. Therefore, the answer should be Thursday.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose I start on February 3, 2022, which is a Thursday. Let's count 7 days later. February 10, 2022, would be Thursday. Then 17th, 24th, March 3rd, etc. Each time adding 7 days. So 84 days is 12 weeks. So 12 weeks later would be the same day.

Wait, I can check a calendar, but since I can't access external resources, I need to calculate it manually.\n\nFrom October 3 (Monday) to October 25 (Tuesday). Let's count the days.

From October 3 (Monday) to October 25 (Tuesday) is 23 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 23 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 2 days. So 3 weeks have 3*5=15 business days.

So the period includes from February 10 (Thu) to March 12 (Sat), inclusive.\n\nLet me count the days step by step.\n\nFirst, let's check how many days are in February 2022. Since 2022 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. So February 10 to February 28 is 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Wait, no. Wait, from February 10 to February 28 inclusive: 28 - 10 = 18 days, plus 1 is 19 days. But that's if we count both start and end.

Let me check the actual dates.\n\nFebruary 10 to February 28: 28 - 10 + 1 = 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total days is 19 + 12 = 31 days.

Let's check how many days that is.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So from Feb 10 to Feb 28 is 28 - 10 = 18 days, plus 1 (for the inclusive) is 19 days. Then March 1 to March 12 is 12 days. So total is 19 + 12 = 31 days.

Therefore, business days are 31 - 9 = 22 days.\n\nWait, but let me check again.

So 31 total days minus 9 weekends equals 22 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check the count of business days another way.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Wait, but that would mean that January 1, 2022 is a Sunday. Then, if that's the case, adding 16 days to get to January 17th. Let me count: January 1 is Sunday, so January 2 is Monday, 3 is Tuesday, 4 Wednesday, 5 Thursday, 6 Friday, 7 Saturday, 8 Sunday, 9 Monday, 10 Tuesday, 11 Wednesday, 12 Thursday, 13 Friday, 14 Saturday, 15 Sunday, 16 Monday, 17 Tuesday. Wait, that would make January 17, 2022 a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday is correct. Maybe I should verify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me check a calendar. Wait, I can't actually look it up, but maybe I can use another known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2021 was a Monday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, July 4, 2021 was a Sunday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should use a different method.\n\nAnother way is to use the fact that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days because it was a leap year. So 2020 had 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be a Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. So now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me check again. If January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday, then adding 366 days (2020 is a leap year) would take us to January 1, 2021. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2021 is not a leap year, so 365 days later is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. So that would mean January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Then January 17 would be 16 days later.

But this contradicts my previous calculation where I thought it was Tuesday. So now I'm really confused. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but I need to confirm that. Let me think of another way. Maybe using the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if March 1 is a Monday, then February 28, 2022 was a Sunday (since March 1 is Monday). Then January 31, 2022 would be 31 days before March 1. Wait, that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then 2022 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Because 2023's January 1 is Sunday, so 2022's January 1 is Sunday minus 1 day, which is Saturday. So that would mean that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Then, adding 16 days to get to January 17. Let's count again:\n\nJanuary 1: Saturday\n\nJanuary 2: Sunday\n\nJanuary 3: Monday\n\nJanuary 4: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 5: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 6: Thursday\n\nJanuary 7: Friday\n\nJanuary 8: Saturday\n\nJanuary 9: Sunday\n\nJanuary 10: Monday\n\nJanuary 11: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 12: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 13: Thursday\n\nJanuary 14: Friday\n\nJanuary 15: Saturday\n\nJanuary 16: Sunday\n\nJanuary 17: Monday\n\nSo according to this, January 17, 2022 is a Monday.

Wait, the question is about April 3rd, so I need to count how many days are between January 1 and April 3, then find the weekday.\n\nWait, but if January 1 is a Wednesday, then each subsequent day increments the weekday. So, for example, January 2 is Thursday, January 3 is Friday, etc. But I need to calculate the total number of days from January 1 to April 3, then find the remainder when divided by 7 to determine the weekday.\n\nLet me calculate the days:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. But since we start on January 1, the number of days from January 1 to April 3 is:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (but since we start on day 1, maybe we need to count the days from January 1 to April 3 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find the number of days between January 1 and April 3, inclusive, then it's 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb, assuming it's not a leap year) + 31 (March) + 3 (April) = 31 + 29 + 31 + 3 = 94 days? Wait, but wait, if January 1 is day 1, then April 3 is day 3 + 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 30 (March) = 3 + 31 + 29 + 30 = 93 days? Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the number of days from January 1 to April 3 is:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days. Assuming it's not a leap year, since the problem doesn't specify, but since the starting day is given as Wednesday, maybe it's a non-leap year? Wait, but the problem doesn't mention leap year, so maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year. So February has 28 days. March has 31 days. Then April 3 is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1 to April 3 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (March) + 3 (April) = 31 + 28 is 59, plus 31 is 90, plus 3 is 93 days. So April 3 is 93 days after January 1.\n\nBut wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, etc. So if I have 93 days from January 1, then April 3 is 93 days after January 1. But since the first day is Wednesday, then adding 93 days to that day will give me the weekday.\n\nBut how do I calculate the weekday? Well, since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can take 93 divided by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is.\n\nSo 93 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7*13 is 91, so 93 - 91 is 2. So the remainder is 2. That means April 3 is 2 days after Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 day is Thursday, +2 days is Friday. So April 3 would be a Friday?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because if January 1 is Wednesday, then January 1 is day 0. Then January 2 is day 1 (Thursday), day 2 is Friday, etc. So if April 3 is 93 days after January 1, then the number of days passed is 93. So the weekday is (Wednesday + 93 days). Since 93 mod 7 is 2, then adding 2 days to Wednesday. Wednesday + 1 is Thursday, +2 is Friday. So April 3 is Friday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (non-leap year), so adding 28 days. March has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then April 3 is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1 to April 3 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, if January 1 is day 0, then day 0 is Wednesday. Then day 1 is Thursday, day 2 is Friday, day 3 is Saturday, day 4 is Sunday, day 5 is Monday, day 6 is Tuesday, day 7 is Wednesday again. So the remainder when 93 is divided by 7 is 2. So day 93 is 2 days after Wednesday. So Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. So April 3 is Friday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary 1 is Wednesday. Let's count the days for each month:\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So January 1 is Wednesday. Then January 8 is Wednesday again (7 days later). So January 8 is Wednesday, 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Thursday, 31 is Friday.\n\nFebruary has 28 days. So February 28 is 28 days after January 1. 28 divided by 7 is 4 weeks, so February 28 is also a Wednesday. Then March 1 is Thursday. March has 31 days. March 1 is Thursday. March 8, 15, 22, 29 are Thursdays. Then March 30 is Friday, March 31 is Saturday. Then April 1 is Sunday. April 2 is Monday, April 3 is Tuesday? Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, this is confusing. So according to this, April 3 would be Tuesday. But earlier calculation said Friday. There's a discrepancy here. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let's go step by step again. Let's start with January 1 as Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (7 days later)\n\nJanuary 15: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 22: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 29: Wednesday\n\nThen January 30 is Thursday, January 31 is Friday.\n\nFebruary 1 is Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, January 31 is Friday. Then February 1 is Saturday. Wait, that's different from what I thought before. Wait, if January 31 is Friday, then February 1 is Saturday. Then February 2 is Sunday, February 3 is Monday, etc. So February has 28 days. So February 28 is 28 days after January 1. Let's check: January 1 is day 0 (Wednesday). Then February 28 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) - 1 = 58 days? Wait, no. Wait, the number of days from January 1 to February 28 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59 days. Wait, but if January 1 is day 0, then February 28 is day 58? Or day 59?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of it as the number of days from January 1 to the target date. So if January 1 is day 1, then January 2 is day 2, etc. But the problem says that January 1 is Wednesday. So if I want to find the day of the week for April 3, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1 and April 3, inclusive or exclusive?\n\nWait, the key is that if January 1 is day 0 (Wednesday), then adding 1 day gets to day 1 (Thursday), etc. So the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 93 days. So April 3 is 93 days after January 1. So 93 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 2 days. So 13 weeks later is the same day, Wednesday, plus 2 days is Friday. So April 3 should be Friday. But when I tried to count step by step, I thought that February 1 is Saturday, which would make March 1 be a Monday? Wait, let me check again.\n\nLet me list the days step by step:\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday\n\nJanuary 2: Thursday\n\nJanuary 3: Friday\n\nJanuary 4: Saturday\n\nJanuary 5: Sunday\n\nJanuary 6: Monday\n\nJanuary 7: Tuesday\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday\n\nSo January 8 is Wednesday again. Then January 15 is Wednesday, 22, 29. Then January 30 is Thursday, 31 is Friday.\n\nFebruary 1 is Saturday. Then February 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday, 4 is Tuesday, 5 is Wednesday, 6 is Thursday, 7 is Friday, 8 is Saturday, 9 is Sunday, 10 is Monday, 11 is Tuesday, 12 is Wednesday, 13 is Thursday, 14 is Friday, 15 is Saturday, 16 is Sunday, 17 is Monday, 18 is Tuesday, 19 is Wednesday, 20 is Thursday, 21 is Friday, 22 is Saturday, 23 is Sunday, 24 is Monday, 25 is Tuesday, 26 is Wednesday, 27 is Thursday, 28 is Friday. Wait, February 28 is Friday? But that's 28 days after January 1. Wait, January 1 is day 0, so February 28 is day 28 + 31 (Jan) - 1? Wait, no. Wait, January has 31 days, so from January 1 to February 28 is 31 + 28 = 59 days. Wait, but if January 1 is day 0, then February 28 is day 58? Or day 59?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of it as the number of days from January 1 to the target date. So if January 1 is day 1, then February 28 is day 31 + 28 = 59. But if January 1 is day 0, then February 28 is day 58. But that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should count the number of days between January 1 and April 3, inclusive. Wait, but the problem is that if you have January 1 as day 0, then the next day is day 1, and so on. So the total number of days from January 1 to April 3 is 93 days. So 93 days after January 1 is April 3. So 93 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 2. So 93 days is 13 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Wednesday gives Friday. So April 3 is Friday.\n\nBut when I tried to count step by step, I thought that February 28 is Friday. Let me check that again. If January 1 is Wednesday, then January 8 is Wednesday. So January 8 is day 8. Then January 15 is day 15, 22, 29. Then January 30 is day 30 (Thursday), January 31 is day 31 (Friday). Then February 1 is day 32 (Saturday). Then February 2 is day 33 (Sunday), February 3 is day 34 (Monday), February 4 is day 35 (Tuesday), February 5 is day 36 (Wednesday), February 6 is day 37 (Thursday), February 7 is day 38 (Friday), February 8 is day 39 (Saturday), and so on. So February 28 is day 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59 days. Wait, but if January 1 is day 0, then day 0 is Wednesday. So day 31 is January 31, which is Friday. Then day 32 is February 1 (Saturday). So day 59 would be February 28. Let's calculate 59 - 31 = 28 days after January 31. So 28 days is 4 weeks, so same day as January 31, which is Friday. So February 28 is Friday. Then March 1 is Saturday. March has 31 days. So March 1 is Saturday. March 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. March 30 is Sunday, March 31 is Monday. Then April 1 is Tuesday. April 2 is Wednesday, April 3 is Thursday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. So according to this step-by-step count, April 3 is Thursday. But earlier calculation said Friday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check again. If February 28 is Friday, then March 1 is Saturday. March 1 is Saturday. Then March 8 is Saturday, 15, 22, 29. March 30 is Sunday, March 31 is Monday. Then April 1 is Tuesday. April 2 is Wednesday, April 3 is Thursday. So according to this, April 3 is Thursday. But earlier calculation said Friday. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh! The mistake is in the initial assumption of the number of days. Let me recalculate the number of days between January 1 and April 3. If January 1 is day 0, then April 3 is day 93. But if the step-by-step count shows that April 3 is Thursday, then that would mean that 93 days after Wednesday is Thursday. Let's check what 93 mod 7 is. 7*13=91, 93-91=2. So 93 days is 2 days after Wednesday. Wednesday + 2 days is Friday. But according to the step-by-step count, it's Thursday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the methods is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the step-by-step count is wrong. Let me check again. Let's list the days for February.\n\nIf January 1 is Wednesday (day 0), then:\n\nJanuary 1: 0 (Wednesday)\n\nJanuary 2: 1 (Thursday)\n\nJanuary 3: 2 (Friday)\n\nJanuary 4: 3 (Saturday)\n\nJanuary 5: 4 (Sunday)\n\nJanuary 6: 5 (Monday)\n\nJanuary 7: 6 (Tuesday)\n\nJanuary 8: 7 (Wednesday)\n\nSo January 8 is day 7, which is Wednesday. Then January 15 is day 14 (Wednesday), 22 (day 21), 29 (day 28). Then January 30 is day 29 (Thursday), January 31 is day 30 (Friday). Then February 1 is day 31 (Saturday). February 2 is day 32 (Sunday), February 3 is day 33 (Monday), February 4 is day 34 (Tuesday), February 5 is day 35 (Wednesday), February 6 is day 36 (Thursday), February 7 is day 37 (Friday), February 8 is day 38 (Saturday), February 9 is day 39 (Sunday), February 10 is day 40 (Monday), February 11 is day 41 (Tuesday), February 12 is day 42 (Wednesday), February 13 is day 43 (Thursday), February 14 is day 44 (Friday), February 15 is day 45 (Saturday), February 16 is day 46 (Sunday), February 17 is day 47 (Monday), February 18 is day 48 (Tuesday), February 19 is day 49 (Wednesday), February 20 is day 50 (Thursday), February 21 is day 51 (Friday), February 22 is day 52 (Saturday), February 23 is day 53 (Sunday), February 24 is day 54 (Monday), February 25 is day 55 (Tuesday), February 26 is day 56 (Wednesday), February 27 is day 57 (Thursday), February 28 is day 58 (Friday). So February 28 is day 58, which is Friday. Then March 1 is day 59 (Saturday). March 1 is Saturday. March 8 is Saturday (day 66), March 15 (day 73), March 22 (day 80), March 29 (day 87). March 30 is day 88 (Sunday), March 31 is day 89 (Monday). April 1 is day 90 (Tuesday), April 2 is day 91 (Wednesday), April 3 is day 92 (Thursday). Wait, so April 3 is day 92. So 92 days after January 1. So 92 divided by 7 is 13*7=91, remainder 1"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 10 to Tuesday, June 14, 2022 (including both start and end dates). State the amount as a number.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between Sunday, April 10, 2022, and Tuesday, June 14, 2022, inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. April 10, 2022, is a Sunday. Then the end date is June 14, 2022, which is a Tuesday. So the period includes from April 10 to June 14, inclusive.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many days are there in total between these two dates. Then, subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. But maybe it's better to count the weekdays directly. Let me try both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: Total days minus weekends.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of days from April 10 to June 14, inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nApril has 30 days. April 10 is the starting day. So from April 10 to April 30 is 30 - 10 = 20 days, but since we include both start and end, it's 20 + 1 = 21 days in April. Wait, no. Wait, if you have April 10 to April 30, that's 30 - 10 + 1 = 21 days. Then May has 31 days, and June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total days would be 21 (April) + 31 (May) + 14 (June) = 66 days. Wait, but that's from April 10 to June 14 inclusive? Let me check again.\n\nWait, April 10 to April 30 is 21 days (including both). Then May has 31 days. Then June 1 to June 14 is 14 days. So total is 21 + 31 + 14 = 66 days. So total days between April 10 and June 14 inclusive is 66 days.\n\nNow, how many weekends are in this period? Let's see. The starting day is Sunday, April 10. So April 10 is Sunday. Then April 11 is Monday, and so on. Let's check the weekends in each month.\n\nFirst, April: April 10 is Sunday. So the next weekend would be April 11 (Monday) to April 17 (Saturday). Wait, no. Wait, April 10 is Sunday. So the next Saturday is April 16, and the next Sunday is April 17. Wait, maybe I need to list the weekends in each month.\n\nAlternatively, since the total days are 66, and each week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday), but depending on how the days fall, the number of weekends can vary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to count the number of weekdays directly. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from April 10 (Sunday), the first day is a Sunday. So the first weekday is April 11 (Monday). Then the next weekdays are each day until the end of the period.\n\nBut maybe I can calculate the number of weeks and days. Let's see. From April 10 to June 14 is 66 days. Let's divide that by 7 to find the number of weeks and remaining days.\n\n66 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 3 days (since 9*7=63, 66-63=3). So 9 weeks and 3 days. In each week, there are 5 weekdays. So 9 weeks would contribute 9*5=45 weekdays. Then the remaining 3 days would be April 10 (Sunday), April 11 (Monday), April 12 (Tuesday). Wait, but wait, the remaining days after 9 weeks would be the next 3 days. Wait, but the total days are 66. Let me check again.\n\nWait, if the total days are 66, then 66 divided by 7 is 9 weeks (63 days) and 3 days. So the first 63 days would be 9 weeks, and the remaining 3 days would be the next three days. But the starting day is Sunday, April 10. So the first day is Sunday, then the next 63 days would end on... Let's see, 63 days later would be April 10 + 63 days. Let me check that. April 10 + 63 days. April has 30 days, so April 10 + 20 days is April 30 (since 30-10=20 days). Then May has 31 days, so adding 31 days would take us to June 30. Wait, but 63 days is 20 days in April (to April 30) plus 31 days in May (May 31) is 51 days. Then 63-51=12 days into June. So June 12. So the 63rd day is June 12. Then the remaining 3 days would be June 13, 14, 15. Wait, but the end date is June 14. So maybe my calculation is off here. Alternatively, perhaps I should not rely on that approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should list the dates and count the weekdays. But that might take too long. Alternatively, since the start date is Sunday, April 10, and the end date is Tuesday, June 14, let's check the days of the week for each date.\n\nLet me check the days:\n\nApril 10, 2022: Sunday.\n\nApril 11: Monday.\n\nApril 12: Tuesday.\n\nApril 13: Wednesday.\n\nApril 14: Thursday.\n\nApril 15: Friday.\n\nApril 16: Saturday.\n\nApril 17: Sunday.\n\nApril 18: Monday.\n\n... and so on.\n\nSo in April, the weekends are April 10 (Sunday), 16 (Saturday), 17 (Sunday), 23 (Saturday), 24 (Sunday), 30 (Saturday). Wait, April 30 is a Saturday? Let me check. April 10 is Sunday. April 16 is Saturday (since 10 + 6 days is 16, which is Saturday). Then April 17 is Sunday. Then April 23 is Saturday, 24 Sunday, 30 is Saturday. So in April, the weekends are 10, 16, 17, 23, 24, 30. Wait, that's 6 weekend days in April. Wait, but April has 30 days. Let me count the number of weekends in April.\n\nFrom April 10 to April 30: 21 days. Let's see:\n\nWeekends in April:\n\n- April 10 (Sunday)\n- April 11 (Monday) is a weekday.\n- April 12 (Tuesday)\n- April 13 (Wednesday)\n- April 14 (Thursday)\n- April 15 (Friday)\n- April 16 (Saturday)\n- April 17 (Sunday)\n- April 18 (Monday)\n- April 19 (Tuesday)\n- April 20 (Wednesday)\n- April 21 (Thursday)\n- April 22 (Friday)\n- April 23 (Saturday)\n- April 24 (Sunday)\n- April 25 (Monday)\n- April 26 (Tuesday)\n- April 27 (Wednesday)\n- April 28 (Thursday)\n- April 29 (Friday)\n- April 30 (Saturday)\n\nSo in April, the weekends are April 10 (Sunday), 16 (Saturday), 17 (Sunday), 23 (Saturday), 24 (Sunday), 30 (Saturday). That's 6 weekend days. So 6 weekend days in April.\n\nThen May has 31 days. Let's check the weekends in May. May 1, 2022, is a Monday. Wait, April 10 is Sunday, April 11 is Monday. So May 1 is 21 days after April 10. Let me check: April 10 + 21 days is May 1. Since April has 30 days, April 10 + 20 days is April 30, then May 1 is the next day. So May 1 is a Monday. So May 1 is Monday, May 2 is Tuesday, ..., May 7 is Sunday, May 8 is Monday, etc. So in May, the weekends are Sundays and Saturdays. Let's count the number of weekends in May.\n\nMay has 31 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks have 2 weekend days each, so 8 weekend days. Then the remaining 3 days are May 29 (Monday), May 30 (Tuesday), May 31 (Wednesday). Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Monday. So the first weekend in May is May 7 (Sunday) and May 8 (Monday). Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Monday. So the first weekend is May 7 (Sunday) and May 8 (Monday)? No, May 7 is Sunday, May 8 is Monday. Wait, the weekend days are Saturday and Sunday. So in May, the weekends would be:\n\n- May 7 (Sunday)\n- May 8 (Monday) is not a weekend. Wait, no. Wait, May 7 is Sunday, May 6 is Saturday. So the first weekend in May is May 6 (Saturday) and May 7 (Sunday). Then the next weekend is May 13 (Saturday) and May 14 (Sunday), then May 20 (Saturday) and May 21 (Sunday), then May 27 (Saturday) and May 28 (Sunday). Then the next weekend would be May 31 (Sunday) and June 1 (Monday). But May only has 31 days. So May 31 is a Wednesday? Wait, no. Wait, May 1 is Monday. Let me check the days of the week for May 31.\n\nMay 1 is Monday. May 7 is Sunday. May 8 is Monday. So May 13 is Sunday, May 14 is Monday. May 20 is Sunday, May 21 is Monday. May 27 is Sunday, May 28 is Monday. Then May 31 is Thursday. Because May 27 is Sunday, May 28 is Monday, 29 Tuesday, 30 Wednesday, 31 Thursday. So the weekends in May are:\n\n- May 6 (Saturday)\n- May 7 (Sunday)\n- May 13 (Saturday)\n- May 14 (Sunday)\n- May 20 (Saturday)\n- May 21 (Sunday)\n- May 27 (Saturday)\n- May 28 (Sunday)\n\nThat's 8 weekend days in May. So 8 weekends in May.\n\nThen June. The end date is June 14, which is a Tuesday. Let's check the weekends in June. June 1 is a Wednesday (since May 31 is Thursday, June 1 is Friday? Wait, wait, I need to check this again. Wait, May 31 is Thursday. So June 1 is Friday. Wait, that's conflicting with earlier. Wait, if May 1 is Monday, then May 7 is Sunday. Then May 8 is Monday. May 13 is Sunday, May 14 is Monday. May 20 is Sunday, May 21 is Monday. May 27 is Sunday, May 28 is Monday. Then May 31 is Thursday. So June 1 is Friday. So June 1 is Friday. Then June 2 is Saturday, June 3 is Sunday. So the weekends in June would be June 2 (Saturday), June 3 (Sunday), June 9 (Saturday), June 10 (Sunday), June 16 (Saturday), June 17 (Sunday), June 23 (Saturday), June 24 (Sunday). But the end date is June 14. So in June, from June 1 to June 14, the weekends are June 2 (Saturday), June 3 (Sunday), June 9 (Saturday), June 10 (Sunday). That's 4 weekend days in June.\n\nSo total weekends in the entire period: April (6) + May (8) + June (4) = 18 weekend days. So total days is 66, so weekdays would be 66 - 18 = 48. But wait, let me check again. Wait, the total days from April 10 to June 14 inclusive is 66 days. If there are 18 weekend days, then 66 - 18 = 48 weekdays. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the weekends. Let me check again.\n\nApril: 6 weekend days (10, 16, 17, 23, 24, 30). Wait, April 10 is Sunday, 16 is Saturday, 17 is Sunday, 23 is Saturday, 24 is Sunday, 30 is Saturday. That's 6 days. Correct.\n\nMay: 8 weekend days (6,7,13,14,20,21,27,28). Correct.\n\nJune: 2,3,9,10. That's 4 days. So total 6+8+4=18. So 66-18=48 weekdays. But wait, the start date is April 10 (Sunday), which is a weekend day. So when we subtract the weekends, we are including that day. But the problem says to include both start and end dates. So if the start date is a weekend, it's included in the count. So the total number of weekdays would be 48. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of weekdays directly. Starting from April 10 (Sunday), the first weekday is April 11 (Monday). Then each day after that. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between April 10 and June 14.\n\nBut that might take time. Alternatively, since the total days are 66, and the number of weekends is 18, then 66-18=48. But maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the number of weeks. From April 10 to June 14 is 66 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 66 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 3 days. So 9 weeks is 63 days. Then 3 days. In each week, there are 5 weekdays. So 9*5=45. Then the remaining 3 days are April 10 (Sunday), April 11 (Monday), April 12 (Tuesday). Wait, but the remaining 3 days would be the 63rd day plus 1, 2, 3. Wait, the 63rd day is June 12 (as calculated earlier). Then the next three days are June 13 (Wednesday), June 14 (Thursday), and June 15 (Friday). But the end date is June 14, so only two of those three days are included. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, since the start date is April 10 (Sunday), and the end date is June 14 (Tuesday), let's count the number of weekdays.\n\nLet me list the days:\n\nApril 10: Sunday (weekend)\nApril 11: Monday (weekday)\nApril 12: Tuesday (weekday)\nApril 13: Wednesday (weekday)\nApril 14: Thursday (weekday)\nApril 15: Friday (weekday)\nApril 16: Saturday (weekend)\nApril 17: Sunday (weekend)\nApril 18: Monday (weekday)\nApril 19: Tuesday (weekday)\nApril 20: Wednesday (weekday)\nApril 21: Thursday (weekday)\nApril 22: Friday (weekday)\nApril 23: Saturday (weekend)\nApril 24: Sunday (weekend)\nApril 25: Monday (weekday)\nApril 26: Tuesday (weekday)\nApril 27: Wednesday (weekday)\nApril 28: Thursday (weekday)\nApril 29: Friday (weekday)\nApril 30: Saturday (weekend)\nMay 1: Sunday (weekend)\nMay 2: Monday (weekday)\nMay 3: Tuesday (weekday)\nMay 4: Wednesday (weekday)\nMay 5: Thursday (weekday)\nMay 6: Friday (weekday)\nMay 7: Saturday (weekend)\nMay 8: Sunday (weekend)\nMay 9: Monday (weekday)\nMay 10: Tuesday (weekday)\nMay 11: Wednesday (weekday)\nMay 12: Thursday (weekday)\nMay 13: Friday (weekday)\nMay 14: Saturday (weekend)\nMay 15: Sunday (weekend)\nMay 16: Monday (weekday)\nMay 17: Tuesday (weekday)\nMay 18: Wednesday (weekday)\nMay 19: Thursday (weekday)\nMay 20: Friday (weekday)\nMay 21: Saturday (weekend)\nMay 22: Sunday (weekend)\nMay 23: Monday (weekday)\nMay 24: Tuesday (weekday)\nMay 25: Wednesday (weekday)\nMay 26: Thursday (weekday)\nMay 27: Friday (weekday)\nMay 28: Saturday (weekend"], [124, "What day of the week was December 20, 2022? Give the weekday name in full.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to find out what day of the week December 20, 2022 was. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. If I recall, 2022 was a leap year? Wait, no, 2022 is not a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also by 400. So 2020 was a leap year, 2024 will be. So 2022 is not. So February had 28 days.\n\nBut maybe I can use a reference date. Let's say I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that December 20, 2022 is a certain number of days before or after a known date.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I can figure out how many days are between December 20, 2022 and January 1, 2023, then I can subtract that from Sunday to find the day of the week.\n\nWait, December 20, 2022 to December 31, 2022 is 11 days (since 31 - 20 = 11). Then January 1, 2023 is the next day. So from December 20 to January 1 is 12 days (including both start and end dates?), wait no. Wait, December 20 to December 31 is 11 days (since 31-20=11, but including both days? Wait, if you count from the 20th to the 31st, that's 12 days (20th, 21st,...,31st). Wait, 31-20=11, but adding 1 gives 12 days. So December 20 to December 31 is 12 days. Then January 1 is the next day. So from December 20 to January 1 is 12 days. So if January 1 is a Sunday, then December 20 would be 12 days before that. Let's see: 12 days before Sunday. Let's count backwards. 1 day before Sunday is Saturday, 2 days before is Friday, 3 days before is Thursday, 4 days before is Wednesday, 5 days before is Tuesday, 6 days before is Monday, 7 days before is Sunday (which is the same day). So 7 days before is Sunday, then 8 days before is Saturday, 9 days before is Friday, 10 days before is Thursday, 11 days before is Wednesday, 12 days before is Tuesday. Wait, so if January 1 is Sunday, then December 20 would be 12 days before, which would be Tuesday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between the dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that December 12, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If December 12, 2022 was a Monday, then December 19 would be the next Monday, and December 20 would be a Tuesday. But I need to confirm if December 12 was indeed a Monday. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I can figure out how many days are between December 20, 2022 and January 1, 2023, then I can subtract that number from Sunday. Let's calculate the days between December 20 and January 1. December has 31 days, so from December 20 to December 31 is 31 - 20 = 11 days. Then January 1 is the next day. So total days from December 20 to January 1 is 11 + 1 = 12 days. So December 20 is 12 days before January 1. So if January 1 is Sunday, then December 20 would be 12 days earlier. Let's count backwards. 1 day before Sunday is Saturday (1), 2 days before is Friday (2), 3 days before is Thursday (3), 4 days before is Wednesday (4), 5 days before is Tuesday (5), 6 days before is Monday (6), 7 days before is Sunday (7), 8 days before is Saturday (8), 9 days before is Friday (9), 10 days before is Thursday (10), 11 days before is Wednesday (11), 12 days before is Tuesday (12). So that would mean December 20, 2022 was a Tuesday. But I need to check if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a known reference. Wait, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that December 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. If that's the case, then December 20 would be two days before, which would be Monday. Wait, but that contradicts the previous conclusion. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Because December 31 is the day before January 1. So if January 1 is Sunday, December 31 is Saturday. Then December 30 is Friday, December 29 is Thursday, December 28 is Wednesday, December 27 is Tuesday, December 26 is Monday, December 25 is Sunday. Then December 24 is Saturday, 23 is Friday, 22 is Thursday, 21 is Wednesday, 20 is Tuesday. So that would mean December 20 is Tuesday. But if December 21 is Wednesday, then that's correct. So that seems to align. So December 20, 2022 was a Tuesday. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [124, "Is 2014 a leap year? Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2014 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it's a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2014. First, divide 2014 by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2014 minus 2000 is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3.5, which means 2014 is not divisible by 4. Wait, but maybe I should do the division properly. 4 times 503 is 2012, so 2014 minus 2012 is 2. So remainder 2. Therefore, 2014 is not divisible by 4. That means it can't be a leap year, right? Because the first condition is not met. So even though 2014 isn't a century year, since it's not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year. So the answer should be No.", "No"], [124, "In a year where Sunday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 11. Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the weekday of April 11th in a year where January 1st is a Sunday. I need to figure out what day of the week that date falls on.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the number of days between January 1st and April 11th. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm, but since the starting date is January 1st, and the question is about April 11th, maybe it's not a leap year? Or maybe I should assume it's not a leap year unless specified. Let me check. The problem doesn't mention a leap year, so I'll go with a non-leap year, which has 365 days. So February has 28 days.\n\nMarch has 31 days. Then April 11th is the 11th day of April. So adding up all those days:\n\nFrom January 1st to April 11th: January has 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 30 days (since Jan 1 is day 0). Then February is 28 days, March is 31 days, and then April 11th is 11 days. So total days from Jan 1 to April 11 is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 11 is 100 days. Wait, but wait, that's from Jan 1 to April 11 inclusive? Or is it the number of days after Jan 1?\n\nWait, if January 1 is day 0 (Sunday), then January 2 is day 1 (Monday), and so on. So to find the day of the week for April 11, I need to count how many days are between January 1 and April 11, then take that number modulo 7. Because every 7 days the week cycles.\n\nSo let's calculate the total days between January 1 and April 11. Let's do it step by step.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since Jan 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, March has 31 days, and April 11 is 11 days. So total days from Jan 1 to April 11 is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 11 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 11 is 100 days. Wait, but that would be 100 days after January 1. But if January 1 is day 0, then day 1 is January 2, and so on. So April 11 is day 100. Then to find the weekday, we can take 100 divided by 7. Let's compute 100 divided by 7. 7*14 is 98, so 100-98 is 2. So 100 days later is 14 weeks and 2 days. So if January 1 is Sunday, then adding 14 weeks (which is 98 days) would still be Sunday. Then adding 2 more days would be Monday (day 1) and Tuesday (day 2). Therefore, April 11 would be a Tuesday?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me recount. From January 1 to April 11:\n\nJanuary: 31 days. So from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 30 days (since Jan 1 is day 0). Then February is 28 days, March is 31 days, and April 11 is 11 days. So total days from Jan 1 to April 11 is 30 + 28 + 31 + 11 = 100 days. But wait, that's not correct. Because if you go from Jan 1 to Jan 31, that's 30 days later. Then adding February (28 days) brings you to 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 58 + 31 = 89 days. Then April 11 is 11 days, so 89 + 11 = 100 days. So yes, 100 days after January 1. So 100 days later. So 100 divided by 7 is 14 weeks and 2 days. So 14 weeks is 98 days, so 100 days is 2 days more. So starting from Sunday (Jan 1), adding 2 days would be Monday (day 1) and Tuesday (day 2). Therefore, April 11 is a Tuesday. But wait, let me check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's see:\n\nJanuary 1 is Sunday. Then January 8 is Sunday again (7 days later). January 15 is Sunday, January 22, January 29. Then February 5 is Sunday. February 12, 19, 26. March 5, 12, 19, 26. April 2 is Sunday. Then April 9 is Sunday, April 16 is Sunday. So April 11 is two days before April 13 (which is a Sunday). Wait, April 11 would be Saturday? Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, if April 2 is Sunday, then April 9 is Sunday (7 days later), April 16 is Sunday. So April 11 is 5 days before April 16. So April 16 is Sunday, so April 11 is Sunday minus 5 days. Let's count backwards: April 16 (Sunday) minus 1 day is April 15 (Saturday), minus 2 is April 14 (Friday), minus 3 is April 13 (Thursday), minus 4 is April 12 (Wednesday), minus 5 is April 11 (Tuesday). So that would be Tuesday. So that matches the previous calculation. So April 11 is Tuesday. But wait, when I thought of April 2 as Sunday, then April 9 is Sunday, so April 11 is two days after April 9. Wait, April 9 is Sunday, so April 10 is Monday, April 11 is Tuesday. Oh, that's correct. So that's consistent. So that's Tuesday. So the answer should be Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought April 11 was two days before April 13, but that's not correct. April 13 is a Thursday, so April 11 is Tuesday. So that's correct. So the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [124, "Between Tuesday, January 25, 2022 and Tuesday, March 29, 2022 (counting both dates), what's the total count of business days (Monday through Friday)? Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the total number of business days between Tuesday, January 25, 2022, and Tuesday, March 29, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) that fall within that period.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to calculate the number of weeks and the remaining days. Let me check the dates. January 25 is a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think January 25, 2022 was a Tuesday. Let me check that. Well, maybe I can just proceed with that assumption since the problem states it.\n\nSo the period starts on a Tuesday and ends on a Tuesday. Let me calculate the total number of days between those two dates. Let's break it down month by month.\n\nFirst, from January 25 to January 31: January has 31 days. So from the 25th to the 31st inclusive is 31 - 25 + 1 = 7 days. Wait, January 25 is day 1, then 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. That's 7 days. But since the start date is Tuesday, January 25, and the end date is Tuesday, March 29, I need to check how many days are in each month.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the total days between the two dates. Let me use a method where I calculate the total days from the start date to the end date, then subtract the weekends.\n\nAlternatively, since the start and end dates are both Tuesdays, maybe the total number of days is a multiple of 7 plus some days. Let me check the months involved.\n\nJanuary 25 to January 31: 7 days (including both ends). Then February has 28 days in 2022 because 2022 is not a leap year. Then March 1 to March 29: 29 days. Wait, March 29 is the end date. So total days would be 7 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 29 (Mar) = 64 days? Wait, wait, no. Wait, from January 25 to January 31 is 7 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days would be 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days. Wait, but that would be from January 25 to March 29 inclusive? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, if I start on January 25, then add 7 days to get to January 31. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days would take me to March 1. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So total days is 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days. But wait, that would be 7 days in January (including the start date), 28 days in February, and 29 days in March. But wait, March 29 is the end date. So that's correct. So total days is 64.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another method. Let me use the actual dates. Let's count the days between January 25 and March 29, inclusive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that from January 25 to March 29 is 64 days. But I need to confirm that. Let me check the number of days in each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 25 to January 31 is 7 days. Then February has 28 days. Then March 1 to March 29 is 29 days. So 7 + 28 + 29 = 64 days. So total days is 64.\n\nNow, out of these 64 days, how many are weekends? Since the start date is a Tuesday, and the end date is also a Tuesday. Let's see. Each week has 5 business days and 2 weekends. So if the total number of days is a multiple of 7, then the number of weekends would be (total days / 7) * 2. But since 64 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 1 day. Because 7*9=63, so 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day. So that would mean 9 weeks * 2 = 18 weekend days, plus the extra day. But since the start date is a Tuesday, the extra day is a Tuesday. So that day is a business day. Therefore, total weekends would be 18. So total business days would be 64 - 18 = 46.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Because if the total days are 64, and the first day is Tuesday, then the 64th day is also a Tuesday. So the first day is Tuesday, the next day is Wednesday, etc. So in each week, there are two weekend days. So 9 weeks would be 63 days, which would have 9*2=18 weekend days. Then the 64th day is a Tuesday, which is a business day. So total weekends are 18. Therefore, business days are 64 - 18 = 46. So the answer would be 46?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check again. Let me count the days between January 25 and March 29 inclusive.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a date calculator. But since I can't do that here, I need to verify.\n\nJanuary 25 is day 1. Then January 26 is day 2, ..., January 31 is day 7. Then February has 28 days, so day 8 is February 1, day 28 is February 28. Then March 1 is day 29, March 29 is day 29 + 28 = day 57? Wait, no. Wait, January has 31 days. So from January 25 to January 31 is 7 days. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days would take us to March 1. So March 1 is day 7 + 28 = day 35. Then March 29 is 29 days after March 1. So day 35 + 28 = day 63? Wait, March 1 is day 35, March 2 is 36, ..., March 29 is day 35 + 28 = day 63. Wait, but that would mean that the total days from January 25 to March 29 is 63 days? But that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, what's the correct way?\n\nWait, if January 25 is day 1, then January 26 is day 2, ..., January 31 is day 7. Then February 1 is day 8, and February 28 is day 8 + 27 = day 35 (since February has 28 days, so day 8 is Feb 1, day 35 is Feb 28). Then March 1 is day 36. Then March 29 is day 36 + 28 = day 64. Wait, March 1 is day 36, March 29 is 29 days later. So day 36 + 28 = day 64. So that's 64 days total. So that's correct. So the total days is 64. So that's where the 64 comes from.\n\nSo then, the total days is 64. Now, how many weekends are in that period?\n\nSince the first day is Tuesday, and the last day is Tuesday. So each week starts on Tuesday. Let's think of the days as weeks. Each week has 7 days. So 64 days is 9 weeks and 1 day. So 9 weeks would be 63 days. The 63rd day would be a Tuesday (since 9 weeks * 7 days = 63 days). Then the 64th day is the next Tuesday. So in those 9 weeks, there are 9*2 = 18 weekend days. Then the 64th day is a Tuesday, which is a business day. So total weekends are 18. Therefore, business days are 64 - 18 = 46.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check the actual days. Let's think of the first week: January 25 (Tuesday) to January 26 (Wednesday), ..., January 29 (Saturday), January 30 (Sunday), January 31 (Monday). Wait, that's 7 days. So in that first week, the weekends are Saturday (Jan 29) and Sunday (Jan 30). So that's 2 days. Then the next week would be February 1 (Tuesday) to February 7 (Monday). Again, weekends are Saturday (Feb 5) and Sunday (Feb 6). So each week has 2 weekend days. So 9 weeks would have 18 weekend days. Then the 64th day is Tuesday, March 29, which is a business day. So total business days are 64 - 18 = 46. So the answer is 46?\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if the first week is correct. Let me count the days again. January 25 is Tuesday. Then January 26 is Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So that's 7 days. So in that first week, the weekends are Saturday (29) and Sunday (30). Then the next week starts on February 1 (Tuesday). So each week has two weekends. So 9 weeks would be 63 days, with 18 weekends. Then the 64th day is Tuesday, March 29. So that's correct. Therefore, 64 total days minus 18 weekends equals 46 business days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check another way. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between those dates.\n\nSince the first day is Tuesday, and the last day is Tuesday. Let's see. Each week has 5 business days. So 9 weeks would be 9*5 = 45 business days. Then the extra day is Tuesday, which is a business day. So total business days would be 45 + 1 = 46. That matches the previous calculation. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 46.", "46"], [124, "If a meeting is scheduled on the last Saturday of December 2022, on which day of the month does it occur?

So if January 1, 2023, is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022, would be a Saturday. Wait, that makes sense because the day before Sunday is Saturday. So that would mean December 31, 2022, is a Saturday.

So the first Saturday would be December 3, 2022. Then adding 7 days each time: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. So the last Saturday would be December 31. That matches the previous conclusion. So that seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 31. But wait, the question says to give the count numerically. So December 31 is the 31st. So the answer is 31.

July has 31 days, so from July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September has 30, October has 31, and November 15 is the 15th day of November. So total days from July 4 to November 15 would be 27 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 15 (November) = 27 + 31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 15 is 134 days. Wait, but that's from July 4 to November 15 inclusive? Or exclusive? Wait, if July 4 is day 0 (Monday), then adding 134 days would take me to November 15. But since each week has 7 days, the day of the week would be (Monday + 134 days). Let me calculate 134 divided by 7. 7*19 is 133, so 134 days is 19 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Monday would be Tuesday. Wait, but that would mean November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday? But I'm not sure if my calculation is correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me recount. From July 4 to July 31: July 4 is the 4th, so July 5 to July 31 is 27 days. Then August is 31 days, September 30, October 31, and November 15. So total days from July 4 to November 15 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15? Wait, no. Wait, if I start on July 4, then July 4 is day 0. Then July 5 is +1 day, so to get to July 31, that's 27 days later. Then August is 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then September is 30, October 31, and November 15 is 15 days. So total days from July 4 to November 15 is 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, if I start on July 4, then the days from July 4 to July 31 is 27 days (since July 4 is day 0, July 5 is day 1, ..., July 31 is day 27). Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then September has 30 days, adding 30. Then October has 31 days, adding 31. Then November 15 is 15 days. Wait, but that would be 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 = 134 days. But that's from July 4 to November 15 inclusive? Or is it from July 4 to November 14? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact number of days between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. For example, I know that November 15, 2022 is a Tuesday. Wait, but I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a different method. Wait, but since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory or calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then, November 15, 2022 would be earlier in the year. Let me count the days from December 31, 2022 (Saturday) back to November 15, 2022. December has 31 days, so November 15 to December 31 is 31 - 15 = 16 days in November (from November 15 to November 30 is 16 days?), wait no. Wait, November 15 to November 30 is 15 days (since 30 - 15 = 15, but including November 15? Wait, if I go from November 15 to December 31, that's 16 days in November (November 15 to November 30 is 16 days: 30 - 15 = 15 days, but including both start and end? Wait, no. If you have November 15 to November 16, that's 2 days. So from November 15 to November 30 is 16 days (30 - 15 = 15 days, but adding 1 for inclusive). Wait, maybe I should calculate the number of days between November 15 and December 31. November has 30 days, so from November 15 to November 30 is 16 days (30 - 15 = 15 days, but including November 15, so 16 days). Then December has 31 days. So total days from November 15 to December 31 is 16 + 31 = 47 days. So if December 31 is a Saturday, then November 15 would be 47 days before that. Since 47 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 5 days. So subtracting 5 days from Saturday. Saturday minus 5 days is Monday. Wait, because Saturday minus 1 day is Friday, minus 2 is Thursday, minus 3 is Wednesday, minus 4 is Tuesday, minus 5 is Monday. So November 15, 2022 would be a Monday? But that contradicts my previous calculation where I thought it was Tuesday. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check again. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then adding 134 days would be 19 weeks and 1 day, so Monday + 1 day is Tuesday. But according to the second method, it's Monday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that July 4, 2022 was a Monday is wrong. Let me check that. If I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then July 4, 2023 would be a Monday plus 365 days. Since 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day, so July 4, 2023 would be a Tuesday. But I know that July 4, 2023 was a Monday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Wait, actually, 2023 is not a leap year, so 365 days. So if July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then July 4, 2023 would be a Tuesday. But I think that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should check another way. Let me think about the day of the week for a known date in 2022. For example, I know that December 25, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, if that's the case, then December 25 is Sunday. Let me count back to November 15. December 25 is Sunday. November 15 is 10 days before December 25 (November 15 to November 25 is 10 days, then December 1 to December 25 is 25 days, but that's not helpful). Wait, maybe I should count the days from November 15 to December 25. November has 30 days, so from November 15 to November 30 is 16 days. Then December 1 to December 25 is 25 days. Total 16 + 25 = 41 days. So if December 25 is Sunday, then November 15 would be 41 days before that. 41 divided by 7 is 5 weeks and 6 days. So subtract 6 days from Sunday. Sunday minus 6 days is Monday. So November 15 would be a Monday. That matches the second method. So that suggests that November 15, 2022 was a Monday. But then why did the first method give me Tuesday?\n\nAh, maybe my assumption that July 4, 2022 was a Monday is wrong. Let me check that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then adding 134 days would be November 15. But according to the other method, November 15 is a Monday. So that would mean that July 4, 2022 was a Monday minus 134 days. Let's calculate 134 divided by 7 is 19 weeks and 1 day. So 134 days before Monday would be Monday minus 1 day, which is Sunday. So July 4, 2022 would be a Sunday. But I thought I remembered that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Maybe I was wrong. So perhaps the correct day is Monday. Alternatively, maybe I should check another known date. For example, I know that August 15, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, if August 15 is Monday, then November 15 is 90 days later. Let me check that. August has 31 days, so from August 15 to August 31 is 16 days. September has 30 days, October has 31 days, and November 15 is 15 days. So total days from August 15 to November 15 is 16 + 30 + 31 + 15 = 92 days. Wait, that's 92 days. 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So if August 15 is Monday, then November 15 would be Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. But that contradicts the previous conclusion of Monday. So now I'm confused again. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use a different approach. Let me use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I can find the number of days between November 15, 2022 and January 1, 2023, then I can calculate the day of the week. November 15, 2022 to December 31, 2022 is 47 days (as calculated earlier). Then January 1, 2023 is 1 day. So total days from November 15, 2022 to January 1, 2023 is 47 + 1 = 48 days. 48 divided by 7 is 6 weeks and 6 days. So if January 1, 2023 is Sunday, then November 15, 2022 is 6 days before Sunday. Sunday minus 6 days is Monday. So that would mean November 15, 2022 is a Monday. Therefore, the correct answer is Monday. But why does the August 15 method give Tuesday? Maybe I made a mistake in that calculation. Let me check again. August 15, 2022: if that's a Monday, then November 15 is 92 days later. Let me count the days again. August 15 to August 31: 31 - 15 = 16 days. September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November 15 is 15 days. So total is 16 + 30 + 31 + 15 = 92 days. 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So if August 15 is Monday, then November 15 would be Monday + 1 day = Tuesday. But according to the other method, it's Monday. So there's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe August 15, 2022 was not a Monday. Let me check that. If November 15 is a Monday, then August 15 would be 92 days before that. 92 days is 13 weeks and 1 day. So Monday minus 1 day is Sunday. So August 15, 2022 would be a Sunday. But I thought I remembered that August 15 was a Monday. Maybe I was wrong. So perhaps the correct day is Monday. Therefore, the answer is Monday.", "Monday"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the third Thursday in December 2022. Write the total number. Answer with -1 if the ordinal does not exist in the month.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the day of the month for the third Thursday in December 2022. Hmm, first, maybe I should figure out what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me confirm that. If that's the case, then the first Thursday is the 1st. Then the second Thursday would be the 8th, and the third would be the 15th. Wait, but wait, maybe I should check again. Let me think. If December 1 is a Thursday, then adding 7 days would be the next Thursday, so 1 + 7 = 8. Then another 7 days would be 15. So the third Thursday would be the 15th. But wait, maybe I should check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look up the actual calendar for December 2022. But since I can't do that, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think again. Let's say December 1 is a Thursday. Then the Thursdays would be 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. So the third one is the 15th. Therefore, the answer should be 15. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me check another way. For example, if I know that December 2022 had 31 days. Let me think about some other dates. For example, December 29, 2022, was a Thursday. Then December 29 is the fifth Thursday. So that would mean that the third Thursday is 15th. So that seems correct. Therefore, the third Thursday is the 15th. So the answer is 15.", "15"], [124, "If today is Friday, March 11, 2022, what day of the week was it 58 days ago? Provide the full name of the weekday.", "", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what day of the week it was 58 days ago, given that today is Friday, March 11, 2022. I need to figure out the day by counting back 58 days from today.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 58 by 7 to find out how many weeks and extra days that is. Let me do that calculation. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks with a remainder. 7 times 8 is 56, so 58 minus 56 is 2. So that means 58 days ago is the same as 8 weeks and 2 days ago. Since 8 weeks is exactly 56 days, subtracting that from 58 leaves 2 days. So I need to go back 2 days from Friday.\n\nWait, but wait. If today is Friday, then going back one day would be Thursday, and two days ago would be Wednesday. So 58 days ago should be a Wednesday? But wait, maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the date? Wait, but the problem is just about the day of the week, not the actual date. So even if there are different months with different numbers of days, the day of the week would still cycle every 7 days. So regardless of the actual dates, subtracting 58 days is equivalent to subtracting 2 days from Friday. So that would be Wednesday. But let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count backwards step by step. Let's see. Let's start from March 11, 2022, which is a Friday. Let's count back 58 days. But maybe breaking it into smaller chunks would help. For example, 56 days is 8 weeks, so that would bring me back to March 11 minus 56 days. Let me check what date that would be. March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 56 days. Let's subtract 56 days. Let's see, March 11 minus 28 days is March 3 (since 11-28 is -17, but that's not right. Wait, maybe better to count backwards. Let's think in terms of months. March has 31 days. So March 11 minus 28 days would be March 3 (since 11-28 is -17, but that's not correct. Wait, maybe I should subtract 28 days from March 11. March 11 minus 28 days would be February 11, 2022? Wait, no. Wait, March 11 minus 28 days. Let's count backwards. March 11 minus 1 day is March 10. Minus 2 days is March 9. So going back 28 days would be March 11 minus 28 days. Let me think of it as March 11 minus 28 days. Since March has 31 days, March 11 minus 28 days would be March 11 - 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from March 11. March 11 minus 28 days is February 11, 2022? Wait, March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 28 days would be March 11 - 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from March 11. March 11 minus 28 days is February 11, 2022? Wait, March 11 minus 28 days would be February 11? Let me check. March 11 minus 28 days: March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 28 days is March 11 - 28 days. Let's subtract 28 days from March 11. Let's subtract 28 days. March 11 minus 28 days is February 11, 2022? Because March 11 minus 28 days would be February 11. Because March 11 minus 28 days is February 11. Wait, March 11 minus 28 days: March 11 minus 28 days is February 11. Because March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 28 days is February 11. Then, March 11 minus 56 days would be February 11 minus 28 days. Wait, no. Wait, 56 days is 8 weeks. So March 11 minus 56 days would be March 11 minus 56 days. Let me think of it as March 11 minus 56 days. Let's subtract 56 days from March 11. Let's break it down. March 11 minus 28 days is February 11. Then subtract another 28 days: February 11 minus 28 days is January 11, 2022. Wait, but February 11 minus 28 days would be January 11? Because February has 28 days in 2022 (since 2022 is not a leap year). So February 11 minus 28 days would be January 11. So March 11 minus 56 days is January 11, 2022. Then, 58 days ago would be 56 days ago (which is January 11) plus 2 more days. So January 11 plus 2 days is January 13. Wait, but that's not helpful. Wait, no. Wait, if 56 days ago is January 11, then 58 days ago would be 56 days ago minus 2 days. Wait, no. Wait, 58 days ago is 56 days ago plus 2 days. Wait, no. Wait, if today is March 11, then 56 days ago is January 11. Then 58 days ago would be 56 days ago minus 2 days. So January 11 minus 2 days is January 9. But that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Let's count the days step by step. Let's start from March 11, 2022 (Friday). Let's count back 58 days. But maybe it's easier to use modular arithmetic. Since 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 2 days. So 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday. So Friday minus 2 days is Wednesday. So the answer should be Wednesday. But wait, maybe I should check with actual dates. Let me check what day of the week January 9, 2022 was. Wait, but I don't remember. Alternatively, maybe I can check the actual date. Let me think. If March 11, 2022 is a Friday, then March 11 minus 58 days. Let me calculate the date. Let's subtract 58 days from March 11. Let's break it down. March has 31 days. So March 11 minus 28 days is February 11 (since 31 - 28 = 3, so March 11 minus 28 days is February 11 + 3 days? Wait, no. Wait, March 11 minus 28 days. Let's count backwards. March 11 minus 1 day is March 10. March 11 minus 2 days is March 9. March 11 minus 3 days is March 8. Continuing this way, March 11 minus 28 days would be February 11. Because March has 31 days, so March 11 minus 28 days is February 11. Then, subtract another 28 days (total 56 days) would be January 11. Then, 58 days ago would be 56 days ago (January 11) minus 2 days, which is January 9. So January 9, 2022. Now, I need to check what day of the week that was. But how? Well, if March 11 is a Friday, then January 9 is 58 days before. Let me check the day of the week. Since 58 days is 8 weeks and 2 days, so 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday, which is Wednesday. So that would mean January 9, 2022 was a Wednesday. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can check the actual calendar. Wait, I can check online, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my knowledge. Let me think. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, is that correct? Wait, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If that's the case, then January 1 is Saturday. Then January 9 would be 8 days later, which is Saturday + 8 days. 8 days later is Saturday again (since 7 days is a week). So January 9 would be a Saturday? Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, if January 1 is Saturday, then January 8 is Saturday, and January 9 is Sunday. Wait, that would mean that January 9 is Sunday. But according to the previous calculation, 58 days ago from Friday (March 11) would be Wednesday. But if January 9 is Sunday, then that would mean that my initial calculation was wrong. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday is incorrect. Let me check again. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks (56 days) and 2 days. So 58 days ago is 8 weeks and 2 days before today. So if today is Friday, then 56 days ago is also a Friday. Then 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday, which is Wednesday. But according to the date calculation, if January 9 is Sunday, then that would mean that my initial assumption is wrong. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the date calculation. Let me check again. If March 11, 2022 is a Friday, then what day is January 9, 2022?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of days between January 9 and March 11. Let's calculate that. January has 31 days, so from January 9 to January 31 is 22 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), so from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. So total days from January 9 to March 11 is 22 + 28 + 11 = 61 days. Wait, but that's from January 9 to March 11 inclusive? Wait, no. Wait, if I start on January 9, then January 9 to January 31 is 22 days (since 31 - 9 = 22). Then February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. So total days from January 9 to March 11 is 22 + 28 + 11 = 61 days. But that would mean that March 11 is 61 days after January 9. Therefore, if March 11 is 61 days after January 9, then 58 days ago from March 11 would be 61 - 58 = 3 days before January 9. Wait, that's not right. Wait, if March 11 is 61 days after January 9, then January 9 is 61 days before March 11. Therefore, 58 days before March 11 would be 61 - 58 = 3 days before January 9. So January 9 minus 3 days is January 6. Wait, but that's conflicting with previous calculations. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me use the fact that if March 11 is a Friday, then I can count backwards 58 days. Let's break down 58 days into weeks and days. 58 divided by 7 is 8 weeks (56 days) and 2 days. So 58 days ago is 8 weeks and 2 days before today. So 8 weeks ago is also a Friday. Then 2 days before Friday is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be Wednesday. But earlier when I tried to calculate the date, I thought that January 9 was Sunday, which would be conflicting. But maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me recall that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me confirm that. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. Yes, that's correct. So January 1, 2022 is Saturday. Then January 8 is Saturday, January 9 is Sunday. So if January 9 is Sunday, then according to the previous calculation, 58 days ago from March 11 (Friday) would be January 9, which is Sunday. But that contradicts the earlier conclusion of Wednesday. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation of the number of days between January 9 and March 11. Let me recalculate that. Let's count the days from January 9 to March 11. January has 31 days. So from January 9 to January 31 is 31 - 9 = 22 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year). Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. So total days from January 9 to March 11 is 22 + 28 + 11 = 61 days. So that means March 11 is 61 days after January 9. Therefore, 58 days before March 11 would be 61 - 58 = 3 days before January 9. So January 9 minus 3 days is January 6. So January 6, 2022. Now, if January 9 is Sunday, then January 6 is Thursday. But according to the previous calculation, 58 days ago from Friday (March 11) should be Wednesday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check again. If March 11 is Friday, and January 9 is Sunday, then the difference between March 11 and January 9 is 61 days. So 61 days later is March 11. Therefore, 58 days before March 11 is 61 - 58 = 3 days before January 9, which is January 6. So January 6 is 3 days before January 9. If January 9 is Sunday, then January 6 is Thursday. But according to the other method, 58 days ago is 2 days before Friday, which is Wednesday. So which one is correct? There's a discrepancy here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the calculations. Let me check the number of days between January 6 and March 11. January 6 to January 31 is 25 days (31 - 6 = 25). February has 28 days, March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. Total is 25 + 28 + 11 = 64 days. Wait, that's 64 days from January 6 to March 11. But earlier I said that January 9 to March 11 is 61 days. So if January 6 is 64 days before March 11, then that would mean that 58 days before March 11 is 64 - 58 = 6 days before January 6. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to use another approach. Let's use the fact that if March 11 is Friday, then I can count backwards 58 days. Let's count in weeks. 58 days is 8 weeks (56 days) and 2 days. So 56 days ago is also a Friday. Then 2 days before Friday is Wednesday. Therefore, the answer should be Wednesday. But according to the date calculation, if January 9 is Sunday, then 58 days before March 11 is January 6, which is Thursday. So there's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the date calculation. Let me check the number of days between January 6 and March 11 again. January 6 to January 31 is 25 days. February has 28 days, March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. Total is 25 + 28 + 11 = 64 days. So March 11 is 64 days after January 6. Therefore, 58 days before March 11 is 64 - 58 = 6 days before January 6. So January 6 minus 6 days is January 6 - 6 days = December 30, 2021. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe I should count the days from January 6 to March 11. Let me count step by step. January 6 to January 31: 25 days. Then February"], [124, "Name the day of the week for 10/16/2022.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's 2023. Let me check if that's correct.

Wait, July 4, 2022: if I check online, but since I can't access the internet, I need to rely on my memory. Alternatively, maybe I can use another date. Let's think about October 16, 2022.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days from a known date. Let's say I know that October 16, 2022 is a certain day. Wait, but I need to figure it out. Let me think of another approach. Maybe using the fact that each month has a certain number of days. Let's start from a known date. For example, if I know that October 16, 2022 is a certain day, but I need to find it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. So if I go back from there. Let's see: January 1, 2023 is Sunday. Then December 31, 2022 would be Saturday. Then November 30, 2022 would be a Thursday? Wait, maybe not. Let me think step by step.\n\nWait, if December 31, 2022 is a Saturday, then December 30 is a Friday, December 29 is Thursday, and so on. But how does that help me with October 16?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of days between October 16, 2022 and a known date. For example, if I know that October 16, 2022 is a certain day, but I need to find it. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 16, 2022 is 16 days into October. Let me think about the days in October. October has 31 days. So October 1 is a Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, if I can figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022 was, then I can count forward 15 days to get to October 16.\n\nBut how do I find October 1, 2022? Let's think. If I know that October 16, 2022 is a certain day, but I need to find it. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 4, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, I think that's correct. Let me check. If November 4 is a Friday, then October 31 would be a Monday. Wait, but that might not be right. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 16 is the 16th day of the month. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I go back 365 days to December 31, 2022, that would be a Saturday. Then, going back to October 16, 2022, I need to count the days between October 16 and December 31, 2022. Let's calculate that. October has 31 days, so from October 16 to October 31 is 16 days (since 31-16=15, plus 1 day for the 16th itself, so 16 days). Then November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So total days from October 16 to December 31 is 16 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 77 days. Wait, but that's from October 16 to December 31 inclusive? Wait, no. If I start on October 16, then October 16 to October 31 is 16 days (since 31-16=15, so 16 days including the start date). Then November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So total days from October 16 to December 31 is 16 + 30 + 31 = 77 days. But since December 31 is the end date, that's 77 days from October 16. But if December 31 is a Saturday, then October 16 would be 77 days before that. Now, since 77 days is 11 weeks and 0 days (since 77 divided by 7 is 11). So 77 days before Saturday would be Saturday minus 77 days. But 77 days is exactly 11 weeks, so subtracting 11 weeks from Saturday would still be Saturday. Wait, that can't be right. Because if October 16 is 77 days before December 31, and December 31 is Saturday, then October 16 would also be a Saturday? But that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check again. If October 16 is day X, then December 31 is X + 77 days. If December 31 is Saturday, then X + 77 days is Saturday. So X is Saturday minus 77 days. Since 77 divided by 7 is 11, so 77 days is exactly 11 weeks. So Saturday minus 11 weeks is still Saturday. Therefore, October 16 would be a Saturday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between October 16 and December 31. Let me recalculate that.\n\nOctober has 31 days. From October 16 to October 31 is 31 - 16 = 15 days, but since we include October 16, that's 16 days. Then November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So total days from October 16 to December 31 is 16 + 30 + 31 = 77 days. So that's correct. So if December 31 is Saturday, then October 16 is also Saturday. But I need to check if December 31, 2022 is indeed a Saturday. Wait, I thought that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So December 31, 2022 would be the day before, which is Saturday. That seems correct. So if that's the case, then October 16, 2022 would be a Saturday. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Wait, but maybe I should check another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's use another known date. For example, I know that October 16, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. If October 16 is Saturday, then October 17 would be Sunday. But I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's use Zeller's Congruence. The formula for Zeller's Congruence for the Gregorian calendar is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nWhere:\n- h is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)\n- q is the day of the month\n- m is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, ..., 14 = February)\n- K is the year of the century (year mod 100)\n- J is the zero-based century (floor(year / 100))\n\nBut since January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year, for October 16, 2022, m is 10, and the year is 2022. So q = 16, m = 10, K = 22, J = 20.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nh = (16 + floor((13*(10 + 1))/5) + 22 + floor(22/4) + floor(20/4) + 5*20) mod 7\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nfloor((13*11)/5) = floor(143/5) = floor(28.6) = 28\n\nfloor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(20/4) = 5\n\n5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms:\n\n16 + 28 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 16 + 28 is 44, plus 22 is 66, plus 5 is 71, plus 5 is 76, plus 100 is 176.\n\nNow, 176 mod 7. Let's divide 176 by 7. 7*25 is 175, so 176 mod 7 is 1. So h = 1. According to Zeller's Congruence, h=1 corresponds to Sunday. So that would mean October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. But earlier calculation using the December 31 date suggested Saturday. There's a contradiction here. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the Zeller's formula. Let me check again. The formula says h is 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, etc. So if h=1, that's Sunday. So according to Zeller's Congruence, October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. But earlier calculation using the December 31 date suggested Saturday. So which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the December 31 calculation. Let me check that again. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 is the day before, which is Saturday. So if October 16 is 77 days before December 31, then October 16 would be Saturday. But according to Zeller's Congruence, it's Sunday. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days between October 16 and December 31. Let me recalculate that. October has 31 days. From October 16 to October 31 is 31 - 16 = 15 days, but since we include October 16, that's 16 days. Then November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So total days from October 16 to December 31 is 16 + 30 + 31 = 77 days. So that's correct. So if December 31 is Saturday, then October 16 is 77 days before that. Since 77 days is 11 weeks (77/7=11), so subtracting 11 weeks from Saturday would still be Saturday. But according to Zeller's Congruence, it's Sunday. So there's a conflict here. Therefore, one of the methods must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday is incorrect. Let me check that. If I can recall, January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me verify that. For example, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no. Wait, I think that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I need to check that. Alternatively, I can use another method. Let me think. If October 16, 2022 is Sunday (as per Zeller's), then October 17 is Monday. Then October 24 is Monday, and so on. Let's check November 4, 2022. If October 16 is Sunday, then October 23 is Sunday, October 30 is Sunday. November 6 is Sunday. So November 4 would be Friday. Wait, but I thought November 4 was a Friday. If that's correct, then that would align with the Zeller's result. But if December 31 is Saturday, then October 16 would be Saturday. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's calculation. Let me recheck the formula. The formula is:\n\nh = (q + floor((13(m + 1))/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nBut wait, the formula might have different parameters. Let me check again. For the Gregorian calendar, the formula is:\n\nh = (q + floor(13(m + 1)/5) + K + floor(K/4) + floor(J/4) + 5J) mod 7\n\nBut the values of h are 0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday.\n\nSo for October 16, 2022:\n\nq = 16\n\nm = 10 (October)\n\nK = 22 (2022 mod 100)\n\nJ = 20 (floor(2022/100) = 20)\n\nSo:\n\nfloor((13*(10 + 1))/5) = floor(143/5) = 28.6 \u2192 28\n\nfloor(K/4) = floor(22/4) = 5\n\nfloor(J/4) = floor(20/4) = 5\n\n5J = 5*20 = 100\n\nSo adding all terms: 16 + 28 + 22 + 5 + 5 + 100 = 176\n\n176 mod 7: 7*25 = 175, so 176 - 175 = 1 \u2192 h=1, which is Sunday. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, according to Zeller's Congruence, October 16, 2022 is a Sunday. So why is there a discrepancy with the other method?\n\nAh, maybe the assumption that December 31, 2022 is a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then December 31, 2022 is the day before, which is Saturday. But if October 16, 2022 is Sunday, then December 31, 2022 would be 77 days after October 16. 77 days is 11 weeks, so adding 11 weeks to Sunday would still be Sunday. But that contradicts the previous assumption that December 31 is Saturday. Therefore, there must be an error in the assumption that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Wait, but I thought that was correct. Let me check another way. For example, if October 16, 2022 is Sunday, then October 23 is Sunday, October 30 is Sunday. November 6 is Sunday. November 13 is Sunday, November 20 is Sunday, November 27 is Sunday. December 4 is Sunday, December 11 is Sunday, December 18 is Sunday, December 25 is Sunday. Then January 1, 2023 would be Monday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous assumption. So if December 25, 2022 is Sunday, then December 26 is Monday, and so on. Then January 1, 2023 would be Monday. But that contradicts the earlier thought that January 1, 2023 is Sunday. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the days between October 16 and December 31. Let me recalculate that. October 16 to October 31 is 16 days (including October 16). Then November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So total days from October 16 to December 31 is 16 + 30 + 31 = 77 days. So if October 16 is Sunday, then December 31 is 77 days later. 77 divided by 7 is 11 weeks, so December 31 would also be Sunday. But that would mean that January 1, 2023 is Monday. But I thought that January 1, 2023 was Sunday. So which is correct?\n\nWait, I need to check the actual date. Let me think of another way. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If that's true, then December 31, 2022 would be Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, if October 16 is Sunday, then December 31 is Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the assumptions must be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Zeller's calculation. Let me check again. The formula for Zeller's Congruence for October 16, 2022:\n\nq = 1"], [124, "What day of the week was November 28, 2022? Answer with the weekday's name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to find out what day of the week November 28, 2022 was. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me think. If I recall, 2022 was a leap year? No, 2022 is not a leap year because 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, so it's not divisible by 4. So February had 28 days. So January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If December 31, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. But how do I know what day December 31, 2022 was?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a known date in 2022. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. Wait, July 4, 2022: if I count the days from a known date. Let's say July 4, 2022 is a Monday. Then, if I can count the days from that date to November 28, 2022, I can figure out the day of the week.\n\nSo July 4 is Monday. Let's count the days from July 4 to November 28. Let's break it down:\n\nJuly has 31 days. From July 4 to July 31 is 31 - 4 = 27 days. Then August has 31 days, September has 30, October has 31, and November 28. So total days:\n\nJuly: 27 days (from July 4 to July 31)\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober: 31\nNovember: 28\n\nTotal days = 27 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 28 = let's calculate that. 27+31 is 58, plus 30 is 88, plus 31 is 119, plus 28 is 147 days.\n\nSo 147 days from July 4, 2022. Now, since each week has 7 days, I can divide 147 by 7 to find the number of weeks and the remainder will tell me the day of the week. 147 divided by 7 is exactly 21 weeks, so 21*7=147. That means 147 days later is the same day of the week. So if July 4 is a Monday, then adding 147 days would also be a Monday. Wait, but that would mean November 28, 2022 is a Monday? But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me check again. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 11 is also a Monday, and so on. Let me check the actual date. Wait, maybe I should verify if July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let me think of another known date. For example, I know that November 25, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if that's the case, then November 25 is Friday. Then November 26 is Saturday, 27 is Sunday, 28 is Monday. So that would make November 28, 2022 a Monday. But I need to confirm if November 25, 2022 was indeed a Friday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. So if I go back from there. Let's see, December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then November 28, 2022 would be how many days before December 31? Let's calculate. From November 28 to December 31: November has 30 days, so from November 28 to November 30 is 2 days. Then December has 31 days. So total days from November 28 to December 31 is 2 + 31 = 33 days. So 33 days before December 31 is November 28. Since December 31 is a Saturday, subtracting 33 days. 33 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 5 days. So subtracting 5 days from Saturday. Saturday minus 5 days is Monday. So November 28 would be a Monday. That matches the previous calculation. So that seems to confirm that November 28, 2022 was a Monday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another method. Let me think of another known date. For example, I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Let me check that. If October 1 is Saturday, then October 2 is Sunday, and so on. Then October 1 is Saturday. Then November 28 is how many days after October 1? October has 31 days, so from October 1 to October 31 is 30 days. Then November has 30 days, so from October 1 to November 30 is 30 + 30 = 60 days. Then November 28 is 60 - 2 = 58 days after October 1. Wait, no. Wait, October 1 is day 0. October 1 is Saturday. Then October 8 is Saturday, October 15, 22, 29. November 5, 12, 19, 26. So November 26 is Saturday. Then November 27 is Sunday, November 28 is Monday. So that also confirms that November 28 is a Monday. So that seems to be consistent across multiple methods.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Monday.", "Monday"], [124, "How many business days (Monday-Friday) are there from Sunday, August 14, 2022 to Sunday, October 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)? Write the total number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, August 14, 2022, to Sunday, October 16, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the business days directly by breaking it down into weeks and remaining days.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. August 14, 2022 is a Sunday. Then the next day, August 15 is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, August 14 is a Sunday, so August 15 is Monday, 16 is Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday, 20 Saturday, 21 Sunday. Then August 22 is Monday again. So each week has 5 business days and 2 weekends.\n\nNow, the period from August 14 to October 16. Let me figure out how many weeks and extra days there are.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of days between August 14 and October 16 inclusive. But maybe it's easier to break it into months.\n\nAugust: From August 14 to August 31. Let's count the days. August has 31 days. So from August 14 to August 31 is 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days. Wait, because inclusive. So August 14 is day 1, August 15 is day 2, ..., August 31 is day 18. But wait, 31 -14 = 17 days, plus 1 is 18 days. So that's 18 days in August.\n\nThen September has 30 days. Then October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So total days from August 14 to October 16 inclusive is 18 (August) + 30 (September) + 16 (October) = 64 days. Wait, let me check that again. August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. Then September is 30 days. Then October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. So 18 + 30 is 48, plus 16 is 64. So total 64 days.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another method. Let me use a calendar or calculate the days between the two dates. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that August 14 is a Sunday, and October 16 is a Sunday. Let me check what day of the week October 16 is. Wait, August 14 is Sunday. Let me count the days.\n\nAugust has 31 days. So August 14 is Sunday. August 21 is Sunday, August 28 is Sunday. Then September 4 is Sunday, September 11, 18, 25, October 2, 9, 16. So October 16 is a Sunday. So that's correct. So the total number of days between August 14 and October 16 inclusive is 64 days. Because from August 14 to October 16 is exactly 64 days. Let me check that again. August has 31 days. From August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. September has 30 days. October 1 to October 16 is 16 days. 18 + 30 + 16 = 64. Yes.\n\nNow, out of these 64 days, how many are weekends? Since the start and end dates are both Sundays, and each week has 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday). So the total number of weeks in 64 days is 64 divided by 7. Let's calculate that. 7*9=63, so 9 weeks and 1 day. So 9 weeks would be 9*2=18 weekend days. Then the remaining 1 day is the 64th day, which is a Sunday. So that's one more weekend day. So total weekend days would be 18 + 1 = 19. Therefore, business days would be 64 - 19 = 45. Wait, but wait. Wait, the first day is a Sunday, which is a weekend. The last day is also a Sunday. So in the 64 days, how many Saturdays and Sundays are there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of Saturdays and Sundays between August 14 and October 16 inclusive.\n\nLet me list the dates. August 14 is Sunday. So the next day, August 15 is Monday. Then the weekends are August 14 (Sunday), August 21 (Sunday), August 28 (Sunday), September 4 (Sunday), September 11 (Sunday), September 18 (Sunday), September 25 (Sunday), October 2 (Sunday), October 9 (Sunday), October 16 (Sunday). That's 10 Sundays. Then Saturdays would be August 13 (but that's before the start date), August 20, August 27, September 3, September 10, September 17, September 24, September 31 (but September has 30 days), October 1, October 8, October 15. Wait, but the start date is August 14, so the first Saturday in the period would be August 20 (since August 14 is Sunday, August 15 is Monday, 16 Tuesday, 17 Wednesday, 18 Thursday, 19 Friday, 20 Saturday). Then August 20, 27, September 3, 10, 17, 24, October 1, 8, 15. Let's count those. August 20, 27 (2), September 3, 10, 17, 24 (4 more, total 6), October 1, 8, 15 (3 more, total 9). So 9 Saturdays. So total weekends are 10 Sundays + 9 Saturdays = 19. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, total business days are 64 - 19 = 45. So the answer is 45?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because if there are 10 Sundays and 9 Saturdays, that's 19 weekend days. So 64 - 19 = 45. But let me check with another approach. Let's count the business days directly.\n\nStarting from August 14 (Sunday), which is a weekend. So the first business day is August 15 (Monday). Then August 15 to August 19 (Monday to Friday) is 5 days. Then August 20 is Saturday (weekend), August 21 is Sunday (weekend). Then August 22 is Monday. So from August 14 to August 31: Let's count the business days.\n\nAugust 14 is Sunday (weekend). August 15-19: 5 days (Mon-Fri). August 20-21: weekends. August 22-26: 5 days (Mon-Fri). August 27-31: 5 days (Mon-Fri). Wait, August 27 is Monday? Let me check. August 22 is Monday. Then 23 Tuesday, 24 Wednesday, 25 Thursday, 26 Friday, 27 Saturday, 28 Sunday, 29 Monday, 30 Tuesday, 31 Wednesday. Wait, so August 27 is Saturday. So August 22-26 is 5 days (Mon-Fri). Then August 27 is Saturday, 28 Sunday, 29 Monday, 30 Tuesday, 31 Wednesday. So from August 22 to August 31: 10 days. But August 22-26 is 5 days (Mon-Fri), then August 29-31 is 3 days (Mon-Wed). So total 5 + 3 = 8 business days in August? Wait, but that seems conflicting with previous counts. Wait, maybe I need to recount.\n\nWait, August 14 is Sunday. So August 15 is Monday (business day). August 15-19: 5 days (Mon-Fri). Then August 20 is Saturday (non-business), 21 Sunday (non-business). August 22 is Monday (business). August 22-26: 5 days (Mon-Fri). August 27 is Saturday (non-business), 28 Sunday (non-business). August 29 is Monday (business). August 29-31: 3 days (Mon-Wed). So total business days in August: 5 (Aug 15-19) + 5 (Aug 22-26) + 3 (Aug 29-31) = 13 days. Wait, but earlier I thought that August 14 to August 31 is 18 days. So 18 days total. If 13 are business days, then 5 weekends. But according to the previous count, there are 2 Sundays (Aug 14 and 21) and 2 Saturdays (Aug 20 and 27). Wait, that's 4 weekend days. But according to this, August 14 is Sunday, 20 is Saturday, 21 is Sunday, 27 is Saturday, 28 is Sunday. So that's 5 weekend days. Wait, August 28 is Sunday. So that's 5 weekend days. So 18 total days minus 5 weekend days is 13 business days. So that's correct. So August has 13 business days.\n\nThen September has 30 days. Let's count the business days. September 1 is Thursday (since August 31 is Wednesday, so September 1 is Thursday). So September 1 is Thursday, 2 Friday, 3 Saturday, 4 Sunday, 5 Monday, etc. So in September, the weekends are Saturday and Sunday. So each week has 2 weekend days. September has 30 days. Let's see how many weeks. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, plus 2 days. So the first 28 days of September would have 4*2=8 weekend days. Then the remaining 2 days are September 29 (Thursday) and 30 (Friday), which are business days. So total weekend days in September are 8. Therefore, business days in September are 30 - 8 = 22 days.\n\nThen October 1 to October 16. October 1 is Saturday (since September 30 is Friday, so October 1 is Saturday). October 1 is Saturday (non-business), 2 Sunday (non-business), 3 Monday (business), 4 Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, 11 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 13 Thursday, 14 Friday, 15 Saturday, 16 Sunday. So from October 1 to October 16, that's 16 days. The weekends are October 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16. That's 6 weekend days. So business days are 16 - 6 = 10 days.\n\nSo total business days: August 13 + September 22 + October 10 = 13 + 22 = 35 + 10 = 45. So that matches the previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 45.", "45"], [124, "Count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count backward 70 days from Friday, September 2, 2022, and find out what day of the week that falls on. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I remember that each week has 7 days, so maybe I can divide 70 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that: 70 divided by 7 is 10. So 70 days is exactly 10 weeks. Wait, if that's the case, then subtracting 10 weeks from September 2, 2022, should land me on the same day of the week, right? Because a week is 7 days, so subtracting a multiple of 7 days doesn't change the weekday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me confirm the date. September 2, 2022, is a Friday. If I subtract 7 days, that would be August 26, 2022, which is also a Friday. Then subtract another 7 days, August 19, 2022, also Friday. So every 7 days, the weekday remains the same. So 70 days is 10 weeks, so subtracting 70 days would be the same as subtracting 10 weeks. Therefore, the weekday should still be Friday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're dealing with September, which is after February, leap years don't affect this. So the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the days step by step. Let's try that. Starting from September 2, 2022 (Friday), subtract 7 days: August 26, 2022 (Friday). Subtract another 7: August 19 (Friday). Then August 12 (Friday), August 5 (Friday). Then July 29 (Friday). July 22 (Friday). July 15 (Friday). July 8 (Friday). July 1 (Friday). Then June 24 (Friday). Wait, that's 10 weeks, right? Let me count: 7 days each time. So 7 days x 10 = 70 days. So subtracting 70 days would take me to June 24, 2022. But wait, wait, let me check the dates again. Wait, September 2 minus 7 days is August 26. Then minus 7 is August 19. Then August 12, 5, then July 29, 22, 15, 8, 1. Then June 24, 17, 10, 3. Wait, that's 10 weeks? Wait, from September 2 to June 24 is 70 days? Let me check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a calendar or a date calculator. But since I can't do that here, I need to rely on my calculations. Let me check the number of days between the dates. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom September 2, 2022, going back 70 days. Let's subtract 70 days step by step. Let's see:\n\nSeptember has 30 days. So September 2 minus 2 days is August 31. Then subtract 68 days more. Wait, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, let's count the days in each month.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the fact that 70 days is 10 weeks. So if I subtract 10 weeks from September 2, 2022, I get June 24, 2022. Because September 2 minus 7 days is August 26, minus 7 is August 19, minus 7 is August 12, minus 7 is August 5, minus 7 is July 29, minus 7 is July 22, minus 7 is July 15, minus 7 is July 8, minus 7 is July 1, minus 7 is June 24. That's 10 times 7 days. So June 24, 2022. Now, what day of the week is June 24, 2022?\n\nWait, but I need to confirm that. Since September 2 is a Friday, and subtracting 70 days (10 weeks) would still be a Friday. So the answer should be Friday. But maybe I should check if there's a mistake in the date calculation. Let me check the actual date.\n\nWait, let me check the number of days between September 2, 2022, and June 24, 2022. Let's count:\n\nFrom September 2 to September 30: 28 days (since September has 30 days, subtract 2 days to get to September 30: 30 - 2 = 28 days? Wait, no. Wait, September 2 to September 30 is 28 days? Wait, September 2 is day 0. September 3 is day 1, ..., September 30 is day 28. So that's 28 days. Then October has 31 days, November 30, December 31, January 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 24. Wait, but that's going forward. Wait, I need to go backward. So if I subtract 70 days from September 2, 2022, I need to go back 70 days. Let me try to calculate the date.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 70 days is 10 weeks. So if September 2 is a Friday, then subtracting 10 weeks (70 days) would be the same day of the week. Therefore, the answer is Friday. But maybe I should check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of modulo 7. Since 70 divided by 7 is 10 with remainder 0. So 70 days is 0 modulo 7. Therefore, the weekday remains the same. So the answer is Friday.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with a specific date. Let me think. For example, if I take September 2, 2022, which is a Friday. Let's check what day June 24, 2022, is. Let me try to count the days between June 24 and September 2.\n\nJune has 30 days, so June 24 to June 30 is 6 days. July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September 2 is 2 days. So total days from June 24 to September 2 is 6 + 31 + 31 + 2 = 70 days. So that's correct. Therefore, June 24 is 70 days before September 2. Therefore, if September 2 is Friday, June 24 is also Friday. Therefore, the answer is Friday.", "Friday"], [124, "In a year where Saturday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 27. Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find out what day of the week March 27 falls on, given that January 1st is a Saturday. Hmm, I need to figure out the number of days between January 1st and March 27th, then calculate the day of the week based on that.\n\nFirst, let me break down the months. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify a leap year. Hmm, maybe I should assume it's not a leap year unless stated otherwise. So February has 28 days. Then March 27th is 27 days into March.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to March 27th would be: 31 (January) - 1 (since January 1st is the starting day) + 28 (February) + 27 (March). Wait, no. Wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, and so on. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since 31-1=30). Then adding February's 28 days gives 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then adding March 27 days would be 58 + 27 = 85 days total. Wait, but that's from January 1st to March 27th inclusive? Or exclusive?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If January 1st is day 0 (Saturday), then January 2nd is day 1 (Sunday), and so on. So the number of days between January 1st and March 27th is (31 - 1) + 28 + 27 = 30 + 28 + 27 = 85 days. Wait, but that's the total number of days from January 1st to March 27th, not including January 1st? Or including?\n\nWait, if I start counting from January 1st as day 0, then each subsequent day is +1. So the number of days between January 1st and March 27th is 85 days. So March 27th is 85 days after January 1st. Now, since each week has 7 days, I can divide 85 by 7 and find the remainder. The remainder will tell me how many days ahead March 27th is from Saturday.\n\nSo 85 divided by 7 is 12 weeks (84 days) with a remainder of 1 day. So 85 days later is 12 weeks and 1 day. Therefore, if January 1st is Saturday, adding 1 day would make March 27th a Sunday. Wait, but wait, let me check that again. Because if January 1st is Saturday (day 0), then day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, etc. So adding 1 day to Saturday would be Sunday. So March 27th would be Sunday?\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total days. Let me check again. January has 31 days. So from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to day 58 (30 + 28 = 58). Then March 27th is 27 days into March, so adding 27 days to day 58 gives day 58 + 27 = 85. So yes, 85 days total. 85 divided by 7 is 12*7=84, remainder 1. So 85 days later is 1 day after Saturday, which is Sunday. So the answer should be Sunday?\n\nWait, but maybe I should check with another method. Let's count the days step by step. Let's start with January 1st as Saturday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1st is Saturday. Then January 8th is also Saturday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is Saturday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is Saturday. Then March 12th, 19th, 26th. So March 26th is Saturday. Then March 27th is Sunday.

Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, let me check that. If I remember correctly, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that October 8, 2022 is a specific date. Maybe I can count the days from a known date. For example, if I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then adding 7 days would be the next Saturday. Wait, but I need to confirm the actual day. Let me think of another approach. \n\nAnother way is to use the fact that in 2022, October 1 was a Saturday. Let me verify that. If October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then October 8 would be 7 days later, which would also be a Saturday. Wait, but that would mean October 8 is a Saturday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should check a calendar. But since I can't look it up, I need to rely on my memory or calculations. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me think. 2021 started on a Monday. So 2022 would start on a Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1, 2021 was a Monday, then January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I should check. Let me think again. \n\nWait, I think I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, no, that can't be. Because 2021 started on a Monday, so adding 365 days (which is 52 weeks and 1 day) would make 2022 start on a Tuesday. So January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. Then, if I can figure out what day of the week October 1, 2022 was, I can count forward. \n\nLet me try to calculate the number of days between January 1, 2022 (Tuesday) and October 8, 2022. \n\nFirst, let's break down the months:\n\nJanuary has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 1). Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March has 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and October 8 is the 8th day of October.\n\nSo from January 1 to October 8, 2022:\n\nJanuary: 31 days (but since we start on January 1, the days from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. But if we're calculating from January 1 to October 8, we need to sum all the days in each month up to October 8.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to calculate the total number of days from January 1 to October 8, then take that modulo 7 to find the day of the week.\n\nSo:\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober: 8 days (up to the 8th)\n\nAdding those up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n151 + 30 (Jun) = 181\n181 + 31 (Jul) = 212\n212 + 31 (Aug) = 243\n243 + 30 (Sep) = 273\n273 + 8 (Oct) = 281 days.\n\nSo from January 1, 2022 to October 8, 2022 is 281 days. Now, since January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday, adding 281 days to that date will give me the day of the week for October 8, 2022.\n\nBut since 281 divided by 7 is 40 weeks and 1 day (because 40*7=280, so 281-280=1). So adding 281 days is the same as adding 40 weeks and 1 day. Therefore, if January 1 was a Tuesday, adding 1 day would make October 8 a Wednesday. Wait, but that would mean October 8 is a Wednesday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of days.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me add the days step by step:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 31+28=59)\nMarch: 31 (total 59+31=90)\nApril: 30 (total 90+30=120)\nMay: 31 (total 120+31=151)\nJune: 30 (total 151+30=181)\nJuly: 31 (total 181+31=212)\nAugust: 31 (total 212+31=243)\nSeptember: 30 (total 243+30=273)\nOctober: 8 (total 273+8=281). So that's correct.\n\nSo 281 days. Now, 281 divided by 7 is 40 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Tuesday, then adding 1 day would be Wednesday. Therefore, October 8, 2022 would be a Wednesday. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if January 1 is Tuesday, then January 8 is the next Tuesday (since 7 days later). So adding 281 days would be 40 weeks and 1 day. So the day of the week would be Tuesday + 1 day = Wednesday. But I need to confirm if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, October 1, 2022. If I can figure out what day that was, then adding 7 days would be the same day. Let's say October 1 is a Saturday. Then October 8 would be a Saturday as well. But according to my previous calculation, October 8 would be a Wednesday. That's conflicting. So there must be an error in my calculation.\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Tuesday is wrong. Let me check that again. If 2021 started on a Monday (January 1, 2021 was a Friday? Wait, no. Wait, I think I need to get this right. Let me recall that January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year), so 2021 started on a Thursday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day, so 2022 started on a Friday. Wait, that would mean January 1, 2022 was a Friday. But that contradicts my previous thought. So maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let's start from a known date. For example, January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 is a leap year, so 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be 2 days after Wednesday, which is Friday. Then 2021 is 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be 1 day after Friday, which is Saturday. So January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Therefore, my previous calculation that it was a Tuesday was wrong. So that's the mistake. So now, if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then adding 281 days would be 281 days later. Let's recalculate.\n\n281 divided by 7 is 40 weeks and 1 day. So adding 40 weeks (280 days) would bring us back to Saturday, then adding 1 more day would be Sunday. Therefore, October 8, 2022 would be a Sunday. But that conflicts with the previous thought that October 1 was a Saturday. Wait, if October 1 is a Saturday, then October 8 would be a Saturday as well. But according to this calculation, it's Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my calculation of the number of days between January 1 and October 8 is wrong. Let me check again. Let's count the days from January 1 to October 8, 2022.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 31 days. Then February has 28 days (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and October 8. So adding those up:\n\nJanuary: 31\nFebruary: 28 (total 59)\nMarch: 31 (total 90)\nApril: 30 (total 120)\nMay: 31 (total 151)\nJune: 30 (total 181)\nJuly: 31 (total 212)\nAugust: 31 (total 243)\nSeptember: 30 (total 273)\nOctober: 8 (total 281). So that's correct. So 281 days.\n\nIf January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 281 days would be 40 weeks and 1 day. So Saturday + 1 day is Sunday. Therefore, October 8 would be a Sunday. But if October 1 is a Saturday, then October 8 would be a Saturday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the assumptions is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe my assumption that January 1, 2022 is a Saturday is wrong. Let me check that again. If January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday, then 2020 is a leap year, so 366 days. 366 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 2 days. So January 1, 2021 would be Wednesday + 2 days = Friday. Then 2021 is 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be Friday + 1 day = Saturday. That seems correct. So January 1, 2022 is a Saturday. Then October 1, 2022 would be how many days later? Let's calculate the days from January 1 to October 1.\n\nJanuary: 31 days\nFebruary: 28\nMarch: 31\nApril: 30\nMay: 31\nJune: 30\nJuly: 31\nAugust: 31\nSeptember: 30\nOctober 1 is the first day of October, so the total days from January 1 to October 1 is 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 = let's calculate:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n+31 (Mar) = 90\n+30 (Apr) = 120\n+31 (May) = 151\n+30 (Jun) = 181\n+31 (Jul) = 212\n+31 (Aug) = 243\n+30 (Sep) = 273. So October 1 is 273 days after January 1, 2022. 273 divided by 7 is 39 weeks exactly. So October 1, 2022 would be the same day of the week as January 1, 2022, which is Saturday. Therefore, October 1 is a Saturday. Then October 8 would be 7 days later, which is also a Saturday. But according to the previous calculation, October 8 is a Sunday. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the days between January 1 and October 8.\n\nWait, the total days from January 1 to October 8 is 281 days. But if October 1 is 273 days after January 1, then October 8 is 273 + 7 = 280 days after January 1. Wait, that's 280 days. But earlier I calculated 281 days. That's the mistake! Oh no! So I added October 8 as 8 days, but if October 1 is day 273, then October 8 is day 273 + 7 = 280. So the correct number of days from January 1 to October 8 is 280 days, not 281. Therefore, my previous calculation was wrong. That's the error. So the correct number of days is 280. Therefore, 280 divided by 7 is 40 weeks exactly. So October 8 would be the same day as January 1, which is Saturday. Therefore, October 8, 2022 is a Saturday. That aligns with the other calculation where October 1 is Saturday, so October 8 is also Saturday. So the correct answer is Saturday.\n\nBut wait, why did I get 281 before? Because I added October 8 as 8 days, but if October 1 is day 273, then October 8 is day 273 + 7 = 280. So the total days from January 1 to October 8 is 280. Therefore, the mistake was in the initial calculation where I added 31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+8. Wait, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 8 (Oct). But that's adding 8 days for October, but if October 1 is day 273, then October 8 is day 273 + 7 = 280. So the correct total days from January 1 to October 8 is 280. Therefore, the initial calculation of 281 was wrong. The correct total is 280. Therefore, 280 days is 40 weeks, so October 8 is Saturday. Therefore, the answer is Saturday.", "Saturday"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Tuesday, February 1 to Wednesday, April 20, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Alternatively, I can calculate the total days and then subtract the number of weekends. Let me think.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates.

Let's break it down:\n\nFrom February 1 to February 28 (since 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days).

Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days would be 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 20 (Apr) = 79 days. Wait, but wait, the start date is February 1, so that's included. Let me check again. \n\nWait, from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding that gives 28 + 31 = 59 days. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total days from February 1 to April 20 inclusive is 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, if you have 28 days in February, then March is 31, and April 20 is 20 days. So total days is 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. But let me check with another method. Let's use a calendar or calculate the number of days between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that February 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Let me check what day of the week April 20, 2022 is. Wait, the user said it's a Wednesday. So the start is Tuesday, end is Wednesday. So the total days between them is 79 days. But how many of those are weekdays?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks and days. Since 79 days is 11 weeks and 2 days (since 11*7=77, 79-77=2). So 11 weeks would have 11*5=55 weekdays. Then the remaining 2 days are February 28 (which is a Monday, since February 1 is Tuesday, so February 28 is 27 days later. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 6 days. So Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. Wait, February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 2 is Wednesday, ..., February 7 is Monday. Then February 8 is Tuesday again. So February 28 is 28-1=27 days after February 1. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Tuesday: Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. So February 28 is a Monday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. Then March 7 is Monday, etc. Then April 20 is Wednesday. So the remaining two days after 77 days (11 weeks) would be day 78 (Tuesday) and day 79 (Wednesday). So the two extra days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So in those two days, both are weekdays. So total weekdays would be 55 + 2 = 57. But wait, that would be 55 + 2 = 57. But wait, the start date is Tuesday (day 1) and end date is Wednesday (day 79). So the two extra days are day 78 (Tuesday) and day 79 (Wednesday). So those are both weekdays. So total weekdays would be 55 + 2 = 57. But wait, that seems low. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the total days. Let me check the actual number of days between February 1 and April 20, 2022. Let me use a date calculator. But since I can't access external resources, I need to calculate it manually.\n\nFebruary has 28 days, so from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. March has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then April 1 to April 20 is 20 days. So total is 28 + 31 + 20 = 79 days. So that's correct. So 79 days in total.\n\nNow, if the first day is Tuesday (February 1), then the next day is Wednesday (February 2), and so on. So each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekends. So 79 days is 11 weeks (77 days) plus 2 days. So 11 weeks would have 11*5=55 weekdays. Then the remaining 2 days are Tuesday and Wednesday, which are both weekdays. So total is 55 + 2 = 57 weekdays. But wait, that would mean 57 weekdays. But let me check again. Wait, if the first day is Tuesday, then the first week (days 1-7) would be Tuesday (1), Wednesday (2), Thursday (3), Friday (4), Saturday (5), Sunday (6), Monday (7). So in that first week, the weekdays are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday. Wait, that's 5 weekdays. Wait, but the first day is Tuesday, so the first week has 5 weekdays. Then the next week (days 8-14) would be Tuesday again, and so on. So each week has 5 weekdays. So 11 weeks would be 55 weekdays. Then the remaining 2 days are day 78 (Tuesday) and day 79 (Wednesday). So those are both weekdays. So total is 55 + 2 = 57. But wait, the end date is April 20, which is a Wednesday. So that's included. So that seems correct. But maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for the end date. Let me check again. \n\nFebruary 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the days. Let's see, February 1 is Tuesday. Then February 2 is Wednesday, February 3 is Thursday, February 4 is Friday, February 5 is Saturday, February 6 is Sunday, February 7 is Monday. Then February 8 is Tuesday again. So each week cycles every 7 days. So February 28 is 27 days after February 1. 27 divided by 7 is 3 weeks (21 days) and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Tuesday: Tuesday + 6 days is Monday. So February 28 is a Monday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. March 7 is Monday. March 8 is Tuesday. March 14 is Monday. March 21 is Monday. March 28 is Monday. April 4 is Monday. April 11 is Monday. April 18 is Monday. Then April 25 is Monday. But April 20 is two days before April 25. So April 20 is Saturday? Wait, that contradicts the user's statement that April 20 is a Wednesday. Wait, this suggests that there's a mistake in my calculation. Because according to this, April 20 would be a Saturday. But the user said it's a Wednesday. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for February 28. Let me check again. February 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the days step by step. \n\nFebruary 1: Tuesday (day 1)\nFebruary 2: Wednesday (2)\nFebruary 3: Thursday (3)\nFebruary 4: Friday (4)\nFebruary 5: Saturday (5)\nFebruary 6: Sunday (6)\nFebruary 7: Monday (7)\nFebruary 8: Tuesday (8)\nFebruary 9: Wednesday (9)\nFebruary 10: Thursday (10)\nFebruary 11: Friday (11)\nFebruary 12: Saturday (12)\nFebruary 13: Sunday (13)\nFebruary 14: Monday (14)\nFebruary 15: Tuesday (15)\nFebruary 16: Wednesday (16)\nFebruary 17: Thursday (17)\nFebruary 18: Friday (18)\nFebruary 19: Saturday (19)\nFebruary 20: Sunday (20)\nFebruary 21: Monday (21)\nFebruary 22: Tuesday (22)\nFebruary 23: Wednesday (23)\nFebruary 24: Thursday (24)\nFebruary 25: Friday (25)\nFebruary 26: Saturday (26)\nFebruary 27: Sunday (27)\nFebruary 28: Monday (28)\n\nSo February 28 is a Monday. Then March 1 is Tuesday. March 7 is Monday. March 8 is Tuesday. March 14 is Monday. March 15 is Tuesday. March 21 is Monday. March 22 is Tuesday. March 28 is Monday. April 4 is Monday. April 5 is Tuesday. April 11 is Monday. April 12 is Tuesday. April 18 is Monday. April 19 is Tuesday. April 20 is Wednesday. Oh! So April 20 is Wednesday. So that's correct. So my previous calculation was correct. So the end date is Wednesday. So the total days from February 1 to April 20 is 79 days. So the first 77 days (11 weeks) are 55 weekdays. Then the remaining 2 days are day 78 (Tuesday) and day 79 (Wednesday), which are both weekdays. So total is 55 + 2 = 57. But wait, that would mean 57 weekdays. But let me check again. Let's count the number of weekends in the 79 days. Each week has 2 weekend days. 11 weeks have 22 weekend days. Then the remaining 2 days are Tuesday and Wednesday, which are weekdays. So total weekends are 22. So total weekdays would be 79 - 22 = 57. That matches. So the answer is 57. But wait, maybe I should check with another approach. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between those dates.\n\nStarting from February 1 (Tuesday). Let's list the days:\n\nFebruary 1: Tuesday\nFebruary 2: Wednesday\nFebruary 3: Thursday\nFebruary 4: Friday\nFebruary 5: Saturday\nFebruary 6: Sunday\nFebruary 7: Monday\nFebruary 8: Tuesday\n... and so on.\n\nSo each week has 5 weekdays. Let's count how many times each weekday occurs. But maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, since the total days are 79, and the first day is Tuesday, the last day is Wednesday. So the number of each weekday can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of weeks: 11 weeks (77 days) plus 2 days (Tuesday and Wednesday). So in 11 weeks, each weekday occurs 11 times. Then the remaining 2 days are Tuesday and Wednesday, so they each get an extra day. So total:\n\nMonday: 11\nTuesday: 11 + 1 = 12\nWednesday: 11 + 1 = 12\nThursday: 11\nFriday: 11\nSaturday: 11\nSunday: 11\n\nWait, but that would be 11 + 12 + 12 + 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 79 days. Let's check: 11*5 (weekdays) + 2 (weekends) = 55 + 2 = 57 weekdays. Wait, but according to the above, the number of weekdays would be Monday (11) + Tuesday (12) + Wednesday (12) + Thursday (11) + Friday (11) = 11+12+12+11+11 = 57. Yes, that's correct.

Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days. \n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 is a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards to find other dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that May 21, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about the days in May. May has 31 days. Let's see, if I can find a known date in May 2022, like May 1st, and then count the days from there. \n\nWait, I think May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 2 is Monday, and so on. Then May 21 would be 20 days later. Since 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So adding 6 days to Sunday would be Saturday. Wait, but that would make May 21 a Saturday? But I'm not sure if May 1 was a Sunday. Maybe I should cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can use an online calendar or a date calculator, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think again. Let's take a known date. For example, I remember that April 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, April has 30 days. So April 1 is Friday. Then May 1 would be 30 days later. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Friday would be Sunday. So May 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Therefore, May 21 would be 20 days after May 1. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks and 6 days. So Sunday plus 6 days is Saturday. Therefore, May 21, 2022 was a Saturday. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that April 1, 2022 was indeed a Friday. Let me check that. If I remember that March 1, 2022 was a Tuesday. March has 31 days, so March 1 is Tuesday. Then April 1 is 31 days later. 31 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 3 days. So Tuesday plus 3 days is Friday. Yes, that's correct. So April 1 is Friday. Then May 1 is Sunday. Therefore, May 21 is Saturday. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check another date. For example, I know that May 20, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if May 20 is Friday, then May 21 would be Saturday. That matches. But how do I know that May 20 was a Friday? Let me think. If May 1 is Sunday, then May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday. So May 20 would be two days before Sunday, which is Friday. Yes, that's correct. So May 20 is Friday, May 21 is Saturday.

Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 2028 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, check if 2028 is divisible by 4. Let's do the division: 2028 divided by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2028 minus 2000 is 28. 28 divided by 4 is 7. So 500 + 7 is 507. That means 2028 divided by 4 is 507 with no remainder. So that part checks out. \n\nNext, I need to check if it's a century year. Century years are those divisible by 100. 2028 divided by 100 is 20.28, which isn't a whole number. So it's not a century year. Therefore, the second condition about being divisible by 400 doesn't apply here. \n\nSince 2028 is divisible by 4 and not a century year, it should be a leap year. Wait, let me confirm. The rules are: if divisible by 400, then yes. If divisible by 100 but not by 400, then no. If divisible by 4 but not by 100, then yes.

The problem says to include both start and end dates. So the dates in question are August 14 (Sunday) and August 15 (Monday).\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any Mondays in this period. Let's list the days:\n\n- August 14: Sunday\n- August 15: Monday\n\nSo between these two dates, there's only one Monday, which is August 15. Since the end date is included, that counts. The start date is a Sunday, so it's not a Monday. Therefore, the total number of Mondays is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's any other Monday in between.

I remember that there are different ways to calculate the day of the week for a given date. One method is using Zeller's Congruence, but I'm not sure if I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use some known dates and work from there.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up years. Let me think again. Wait, I think January 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Sunday. Yes, that seems right. So if January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then I can count the days from there to August 27.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use a reference date that I know. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. July 4, 2022. Let me check. Wait, I think July 4, 2022 was a Monday. If that's the case, then I can count the days from July 4 to August 27.\n\nSo July has 31 days. July 4 is Monday. Then July 11 is Monday, July 18 is Monday, July 25 is Monday. Then August 1 is Monday. Then August 8, 15, 22, 29. So August 22 is a Monday. Then August 27 would be 5 days after August 22. So August 22 is Monday, 23 is Tuesday, 24 is Wednesday, 25 is Thursday, 26 is Friday, 27 is Saturday. Wait, so August 27, 2022 would be a Saturday?\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that July 4, 2022 was indeed a Monday. Let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method. Let's see. If January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then let's count the days from January 1 to August 27.\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Sunday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 would be a Wednesday. March 1 is 28 days later (since 2022 is not a leap year), which is 4 weeks, so March 1 is a Wednesday. April 1 is 31 days after March 1, which is 3 days later, so Saturday. May 1 is 30 days after April 1, which is 2 weeks and 2 days, so Monday. June 1 is 31 days after May 1, which is 3 days later, so Thursday. July 1 is 30 days after June 1, which is 2 days later, so Saturday. August 1 is 31 days after July 1, which is 3 days later, so Tuesday. Wait, so August 1, 2022 is a Tuesday. Then August 27 would be 26 days later. Let's see, 26 days is 3 weeks and 5 days. So adding 5 days to Tuesday: Tuesday + 5 days is Sunday. Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. So which one is correct?\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. So if August 1 is a Tuesday, then August 8 is Tuesday, 15 is Tuesday, 22 is Tuesday, and 29 is Tuesday. So August 27 would be 2 days before August 29, which is Sunday. Wait, that would make August 27 a Saturday? Wait, August 22 is Tuesday, then 23 is Wednesday, 24 Thursday, 25 Friday, 26 Saturday, 27 Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous calculation.

So maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nSo if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then let's recalculate. January 1 is Saturday. Then February 1 is 31 days later. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So February 1 is a Tuesday. March 1 is 28 days later (2022 is not a leap year), so March 1 is a Tuesday. April 1 is 31 days after March 1, which is 3 days later, so Friday. May 1 is 30 days after April 1, which is 2 days later, so Sunday. June 1 is 31 days after May 1, which is 3 days later, so Wednesday. July 1 is 30 days after June 1, which is 2 days later, so Friday. August 1 is 31 days after July 1, which is 3 days later, so Monday. So August 1 is a Monday. Then August 8 is Monday, 15 is Monday, 22 is Monday, 29 is Monday.

So that would make August 27 a Saturday. But according to the other method, if July 4 is a Monday, then August 27 is Saturday. So both methods point to Saturday. But earlier when I thought January 1 was Sunday, I had a different result. So maybe my initial assumption about January 1, 2022 was wrong. Let me check again.\n\nIf January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then 2022 would be one day earlier, which is Saturday. So January 1, 2022 is a Saturday.

So first, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and January 21st. \n\nWell, January 1st is day 1, so January 21st is 20 days later. Wait, because from the 1st to the 21st inclusive is 21 days, but since we're starting on the 1st, the number of days between them is 20 days.

Let me do that calculation. 20 divided by 7 is 2 weeks with a remainder of 6 days. Because 7 times 2 is 14, and 20 minus 14 is 6. So that means 20 days later is 2 weeks and 6 days.

So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it's a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2015. First, divide 2015 by 4. 4 times 500 is 2000, so 2015 minus 2000 is 15. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75, which means 2015 is not divisible by 4.

Otherwise, it's a leap year.\n\nLet's apply this to 2022. First, divide 2022 by 4. 4 times 505 is 2020, so 2022 minus 2020 is 2. That means 2022 divided by 4 is 505.5, which isn't a whole number. So 2022 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the rules, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me add 2020 and 2024 to confirm. 2020 is a leap year, right? So 2020 + 4 is 2024, which would also be a leap year. So 2022 is in between those two, so it's not a leap year. Also, since 2022 isn't a century year (it's not divisible by 100), the second condition about 400 doesn't come into play here. So the answer should be no.", "No"], [124, "On which weekday did June 26, 2022 fall? Reply with just the weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week June 26, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I could remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, let me check that. If I remember correctly, 2022 started on a Sunday. Let me confirm that. \n\nWait, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Let me think. 2021 started on a Monday, right? Because January 1, 2021 was a Friday? Wait, no, I need to be careful here. Let me try to recall. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 is a specific date. Let me think about the days in June. June has 30 days. So June 1 is a certain day. If I can figure out what day June 1 was, then I can count forward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use an online calendar or a known reference. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my memory. Let me think. \n\nWait, I remember that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. Let me check that. If June 1 is Wednesday, then June 6 is Monday, June 13 is Monday, June 20 is Monday, and June 27 is Monday. Wait, that would mean June 26 is Sunday. But I'm not sure if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me check that. If July 4 is Monday, then June 30 would be a Friday. Because June has 30 days, so July 1 is Tuesday. So June 30 is Monday minus one day, which is Sunday? Wait, no. Wait, if July 1 is Tuesday, then June 30 is Monday. Then June 26 would be 4 days before June 30. So June 26 would be Monday minus 4 days. That would be Thursday? Wait, that doesn't align with the previous thought. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try again. If July 4 is a Monday, then July 1 is a Friday (since July 4 is 3 days after July 1). Wait, no. If July 4 is Monday, then July 1 is Monday minus 3 days, which is Friday. So July 1 is Friday. Then June 30 would be Thursday. Then June 26 is 4 days before June 30. So June 26 would be Thursday minus 4 days. That would be Sunday. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous thought. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another known date. Let me think. I remember that June 1, 2022 was a Wednesday. If that's the case, then June 26 would be 25 days later. Let's count the days. 25 days later. Since 25 divided by 7 is 3 weeks and 4 days. So adding 4 days to Wednesday would be Sunday. So June 26 would be Sunday. \n\nBut I need to confirm if June 1, 2022 was indeed a Wednesday. Let me think. If I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday, then I can count the days. Wait, no, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to recall. \n\nWait, I think 2022 started on a Sunday. Wait, no, 2021 started on a Monday. So 2022 started on a Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so 2022 started on a Tuesday. Wait, but that's not correct. Because 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2021 started on a Monday, then 2022 would start on a Tuesday. But I think that's not correct. Wait, 2021 started on a Monday, so January 1, 2022 would be a Tuesday. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the day of the week for a specific date in 2022. For example, I know that July 1, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, if July 1 is Friday, then June 30 is Thursday. Then June 26 is 4 days before that, which would be Sunday. So that would mean June 26, 2022 was a Sunday. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that June 26, 2022 is the 178th day of the year. Let me check that. January has 31, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 26. So 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 26 = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+31=151, 151+26=177. Wait, so June 26 is the 177th day of the year. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, June has 30 days, so June 26 is the 26th day of June. So the total days up to June 26 would be 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 26 (June) = 31+28=59, 59+31=90, 90+30=120, 120+31=151, 151+26=177. So June 26 is the 177th day of the year. \n\nNow, if I can find out what day of the week January 1, 2022 was, then I can calculate. Let's say January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Then 177 days later would be... 177 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 2 days. So adding 2 days to Saturday would be Monday. But that would mean June 26 is a Monday. But that conflicts with the previous conclusion. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 1, 2023 would be a Sunday. But I think that's not correct. Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so 365 days. 365 divided by 7 is 52 weeks and 1 day. So if 2022 started on a Saturday, then 2023 would start on a Sunday. But I think that's correct. \n\nBut I need to confirm what day January 1, 2022 was. Let me think. I remember that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. So that's correct. So if January 1, 2022 is Saturday, then the 177th day would be 177 - 1 = 176 days later. 176 divided by 7 is 25 weeks and 1 day. So adding 1 day to Saturday would be Sunday. Therefore, June 26, 2022 would be a Sunday. \n\nBut earlier, when I thought July 1 was Friday, that would mean June 30 is Thursday, and June 26 is Sunday. So that aligns. Therefore, the answer should be Sunday.", "Sunday"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, July 31 to Sunday, October 2, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Give the count numerically.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count the number of weekdays between July 31, 2022 (Sunday) and October 2, 2022 (Sunday), inclusive. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, including both start and end. Then subtract the number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in that period. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly by checking each day.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Let me check the dates. July 31 is a Sunday. Then August 1 is a Monday. Let me confirm that. Wait, July 31, 2022 is a Sunday. So August 1 is Monday. Then August 2 is Tuesday, and so on. October 2 is a Sunday again. \n\nSo the period starts on a Sunday and ends on a Sunday. Let me figure out how many days are in total. Let's break it down by months. July has 31 days. So from July 31 to July 31 is 1 day. Then August has 31 days, and September has 30 days. Then October 1 to October 2 is 2 days. Wait, but the end date is October 2, so the total days would be:\n\nJuly 31 (1 day) + August (31 days) + September (30 days) + October 1-2 (2 days). Wait, but that would be 1 + 31 + 30 + 2 = 64 days? Wait, no. Wait, the start date is July 31, and the end date is October 2. So from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days (including July 31). Then September has 30 days, and October 1-2 is 2 days. So total days would be 31 (July 31 to August 31) + 30 (September) + 2 (October 1-2) = 63 days? Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the number of days between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July 31 is day 1, and then count each day. But perhaps it's easier to use a calendar approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the number of weeks between the two dates. Since both start and end on Sundays, maybe there are 5 weeks in between? Wait, but the total days would be 7 days per week. Let me check the exact dates.\n\nWait, July 31 is Sunday. Then August 1 is Monday. Let's count the days from July 31 to October 2. Let's break it down:\n\nJuly 31 (Sunday) to August 31 (Sunday) is 31 days. Then September 1 to September 30 is 30 days. Then October 1 to October 2 is 2 days. So total days from July 31 to October 2 is 31 + 30 + 2 = 63 days. Wait, but that would be 63 days. But if July 31 is day 1, then August 31 is day 31. Then September 30 is day 31 + 30 = 61. Then October 2 is day 61 + 2 = 63. So total 63 days. \n\nNow, since the start and end are both Sundays, and the total days are 63, which is exactly 9 weeks (since 7*9=63). So that would mean that each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekends. So 9 weeks would have 9*5 = 45 weekdays. But wait, but the start and end dates are both Sundays. So in each week, the first day is Sunday, then Monday to Friday are weekdays, then Saturday. So in each week, the first day is Sunday, so the first week would have 1 Sunday (July 31), then Monday (August 1) to Friday (August 5) are weekdays. Then Saturday (August 6) is a weekend. Then the next week starts on Sunday (August 7), and so on. Wait, but if the total is 63 days, which is exactly 9 weeks, then each week has 1 Sunday, 1 Saturday, and 5 weekdays. So total weekends would be 9 Saturdays and 9 Sundays. But wait, the start date is Sunday, and the end date is Sunday. So in the first week, the Sunday is included, and the last week's Sunday is included. So the total number of Sundays would be 9, and Saturdays would be 9. So total weekends would be 18 days. Therefore, the number of weekdays would be 63 - 18 = 45. But wait, that would be 45 weekdays. But wait, let me check that again. Because if each week has 5 weekdays, then 9 weeks would be 45. But maybe that's correct. However, I need to make sure that the first day is Sunday and the last day is Sunday, so the total number of Sundays is 9. But wait, if the first day is Sunday (July 31), then the next Sunday is August 7, then August 14, 21, 28, September 4, 11, 18, 25, and October 2. Wait, that's 9 Sundays. So that's correct. So 9 Sundays and 9 Saturdays. So 18 weekend days. So 63 total days minus 18 weekend days equals 45 weekdays. But wait, but the problem says to include both start and end dates. So if the start and end are both Sundays, then that's correct. But maybe I should check with a specific example. Let's take a smaller period. For example, from July 31 (Sunday) to August 1 (Monday). That's 2 days. The weekdays would be Monday (1 day). So 2 days total, 1 weekend (Sunday) and 1 weekday. So 2-1=1. Which is correct. So that seems to work. So in the case of 9 weeks, 45 weekdays. But wait, maybe I should check another way. Let's count the number of Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays between July 31 and October 2. \n\nJuly 31 is Sunday. So the next day is Monday, August 1. Let's count the number of each weekday. \n\nFirst, let's find the first day of the week. Since July 31 is Sunday, August 1 is Monday. So the first week has:\n\nJuly 31 (Sunday), August 1 (Monday), August 2 (Tuesday), August 3 (Wednesday), August 4 (Thursday), August 5 (Friday), August 6 (Saturday). So that's one week. Then the next week starts on August 7 (Sunday). \n\nSo each week has 7 days. So from July 31 to October 2 is 9 weeks. So each week has 5 weekdays (Monday-Friday). So 9 weeks * 5 = 45 weekdays. Therefore, the answer should be 45. But wait, let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, if the period includes 9 weeks, but the start and end dates are both Sundays, then the first day is Sunday and the last day is Sunday. So the total number of Sundays is 9, and the number of Saturdays is 9. So the total number of weekends is 18. Therefore, 63-18=45 weekdays. That seems correct. But maybe I should check with actual dates. Let's check the dates. \n\nJuly 31, 2022 is a Sunday. August 1 is Monday. Let's count the number of days in each month. July has 31 days, so from July 31 to August 31 is 31 days. Then September has 30 days, and October 1-2 is 2 days. So total days is 31 + 30 + 2 = 63. So that's correct. \n\nNow, let's count the number of weekends. Each week has one Saturday and one Sunday. Since there are 9 weeks, that's 9 Saturdays and 9 Sundays. So 18 weekend days. Therefore, 63-18=45 weekdays. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates. For example, let's count the number of Mondays. August 1 is Monday. Then August 8, 15, 22, 29. Then September 5, 12, 19, 26. Then October 3 is a Monday. Wait, but October 2 is the end date. So the Mondays would be August 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, September 5, 12, 19, 26. That's 9 Mondays. Similarly, Tuesdays would be August 2, 9, 16, 23, 30, September 6, 13, 20, 27. That's 9 Tuesdays. Wednesdays: August 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, September 7, 14, 21, 28. That's 9 Wednesdays. Thursdays: August 4, 11, 18, 25, September 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. That's 9 Thursdays. Fridays: August 5, 12, 19, 26, September 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's 9 Fridays. So total weekdays: 9*5=45. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 45.", "45"], [124, "How many Tuesdays are there from Saturday, October 29, 2022 to Sunday, October 30, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

The question is asking how many Tuesdays are there from Saturday, October 29, 2022, to Sunday, October 30, 2022, inclusive. So I need to figure out the days of the week for those dates and count the Tuesdays.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week October 29, 2022, was. The user mentioned it's a Saturday. Let me confirm that. If October 29 is a Saturday, then October 30 would be a Sunday. So the period is from Saturday the 29th to Sunday the 30th. \n\nNow, the question is, are there any Tuesdays in this two-day period? Well, if the first day is a Saturday, then the next day is Sunday. So the days in between are Saturday and Sunday. There's no Tuesday in there. \n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. Let me think. If October 29 is a Saturday, then October 30 is a Sunday.

For example, October 24, 2022, was a Monday, so adding 5 days would make October 29 a Saturday. Then October 30 is Sunday. So yes, the two days are Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, there are no Tuesdays in that range. \n\nSo the answer should be 0.", "0"], [124, "Between Saturday, April 9, 2022 and Friday, July 1, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Friday occur?

Hmm. First, I should check the dates to make sure I have the correct start and end points. The problem says both dates are counted, so that's important.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total number of days between those two dates, then determine how many Fridays are in that period. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of weeks and then check the remaining days. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by checking what day of the week April 9, 2022, was. The problem says it's a Saturday. So April 9 is a Saturday. Then, the next day, April 10, would be a Sunday, and so on. So if I can figure out the total number of days in the period, then divide by 7, and then adjust for the remainder.\n\nBut maybe I should break it down into months. Let's see: April, May, and June. July 1 is the end date, which is a Friday. Let me check the number of days in each month.\n\nApril 2022: April has 30 days. Since April 9 is a Saturday, April 10 is Sunday. So from April 9 to April 30, how many days is that? Let's calculate. April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 = 21 days, but since we include both start and end dates, maybe I need to add 1? Wait, no. Wait, the total number of days from April 9 to April 30 inclusive is 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. Wait, but if April 9 is day 1, then April 10 is day 2, etc. So 30 - 9 = 21 days between April 9 and April 30, but adding 1 gives 22 days total. But maybe I should check that again. For example, from April 9 to April 10 is 2 days (including both). So yes, the formula is end - start + 1. So April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 + 1 = 22 days. But wait, April 9 is Saturday, so April 10 is Sunday, and so on. So how many Fridays are in April?\n\nLet me think. April 9 is Saturday. So the first Friday in April would be April 8, but that's before the start date. So the first Friday in the period would be April 10? Wait, no. Wait, April 9 is Saturday. So April 10 is Sunday, April 11 is Monday, April 12 is Tuesday, April 13 is Wednesday, April 14 is Thursday, April 15 is Friday. So the first Friday in the period is April 15. Then every 7 days after that. So April 15, 22, 29. Then May 6, 13, 20, 27. Then June 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. Then July 1 is a Friday. Wait, but July 1 is included. So let me check each month.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate the total number of days between April 9 and July 1, inclusive, then divide by 7 and adjust for the remainder. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of days. April has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 22 days (as calculated before). Then May has 31 days, and June has 30 days. Then July 1 is one day. So total days would be 22 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July 1)? Wait, no. Wait, the period is from April 9 to July 1 inclusive. So April 9 to April 30 is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding that. Then June has 30 days. Then July 1 is the last day. Wait, but if we go from April 9 to July 1, that's April 9 to April 30 (22 days), May (31 days), June (30 days), and July 1 (1 day). Wait, but that would be 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Because if you have April 9 to April 30, that's 22 days. Then May is 31 days, so adding that gives 22 + 31 = 53 days. Then June is 30 days, so 53 + 30 = 83 days. Then July 1 is the next day, so adding 1 more day would make 84. But that would mean the total number of days is 84. But wait, let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, using a date calculator. Let me think. April 9, 2022, to July 1, 2022. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 = 21 days, but since we include both start and end, it's 21 + 1 = 22 days. Then May has 31 days. Then June has 30 days. Then July 1 is 1 day. So total is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84 days. Wait, but that seems like adding 22 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 1 (July 1) = 84. But that would mean that the total number of days is 84. But if April 9 is day 1, then July 1 is day 84. But let me check with another approach. Let's check the number of days between April 9 and July 1.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that April 9 is a Saturday. Let's check what day July 1 is. Since April 9 is Saturday, then April 16 is Saturday, 23, 30. Then May 7 is Saturday, 14, 21, 28. June 4 is Saturday, 11, 18, 25. July 2 is Saturday. So July 1 is Friday. So that's correct. So the total number of days between April 9 and July 1 inclusive is 84 days. Because from April 9 to July 1 is 84 days. So 84 days total.\n\nNow, since 84 divided by 7 is 12, that would mean there are 12 weeks. So 12 Fridays. But wait, but if the period starts on a Saturday, then the first day is Saturday, and the next day is Sunday, etc. So the first Friday would be the 6th day (since Saturday is day 1, Sunday 2, Monday 3, Tuesday 4, Wednesday 5, Thursday 6, Friday 7). Wait, no. Wait, if April 9 is Saturday, then April 10 is Sunday (day 2), April 11 is Monday (3), April 12 Tuesday (4), April 13 Wednesday (5), April 14 Thursday (6), April 15 Friday (7). So the first Friday is day 7. Then every 7 days after that. So in 84 days, there are exactly 12 weeks. So each week has one Friday. So 12 Fridays. But wait, but the period starts on Saturday and ends on Friday. So the first Friday is day 7 (April 15), and the last day is day 84, which is July 1, a Friday. So that would mean that there are 12 Fridays. But wait, 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. So each week has one Friday, so 12 Fridays. But wait, that seems too easy. But maybe that's correct. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of Fridays in each month.\n\nApril: April 15, 22, 29. That's three Fridays.\n\nMay: May 6, 13, 20, 27. That's four Fridays.\n\nJune: June 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. That's five Fridays.\n\nJuly: July 1 is a Friday. So that's one Friday.\n\nTotal: 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 13. Wait, that's 13. But according to the previous calculation, it's 12. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, let's check the dates again. April 9 is Saturday. So April 15 is Friday. Then April 22 is Friday, April 29 is Friday. That's three Fridays in April. Then May 6 is Friday. May 13, 20, 27. That's four. June 3, 10, 17, 24, 31. That's five. July 1 is Friday. So that's 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 13. But according to the total days, 84 days, which is 12 weeks. So why the difference?\n\nAh, because the total days is 84, but if the period starts on Saturday and ends on Friday, then the number of Fridays would be 12? But according to the month count, it's 13. So there's a mistake here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 84. Let me check again. Let's count the days from April 9 to July 1 inclusive.\n\nApril 9 to April 30: 22 days (as before). May has 31 days, June has 30 days. July 1 is 1 day. So 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84. But that would mean that the total days is 84. But if April 9 is day 1, then July 1 is day 84. But if April 9 is Saturday, then day 1 is Saturday, day 7 is Friday (April 15), day 14 is Friday (April 22), day 21 is Friday (April 29), day 28 is Friday (May 5?), wait, no. Wait, April 29 is Friday. Then May 6 is Friday (day 28 + 7 = day 35?), wait, maybe I need to check the actual dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the error is in the total days. Let me check the actual number of days between April 9 and July 1.\n\nLet me use an online date calculator or a formula. But since I can't access that, I need to calculate manually.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 9 to April 30 is 30 - 9 = 21 days, plus 1 (inclusive) is 22 days. Then May has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then June has 30 days. Then July 1 is 1 day. So total is 22 + 31 + 30 + 1 = 84. But that seems correct. But according to the month count, there are 13 Fridays. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 84. Let me check again. Let's count the days from April 9 to July 1.\n\nApril 9 is day 1. April 10 is day 2. ... April 15 is day 7 (Friday). Then April 22 is day 14 (Friday). April 29 is day 21 (Friday). Then May 6 is day 28 (Friday). May 13 is day 35 (Friday). May 20 is day 42 (Friday). May 27 is day 49 (Friday). June 3 is day 56 (Friday). June 10 is day 63 (Friday). June 17 is day 70 (Friday). June 24 is day 77 (Friday). June 30 is day 83 (Friday). Then July 1 is day 84 (Friday). Wait, so that's 13 Fridays: April 15, 22, 29; May 6, 13, 20, 27; June 3, 10, 17, 24, 30; July 1. That's 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 13. But according to the total days, 84 days, which is 12 weeks. So why is there 13 Fridays?\n\nAh! Because the period starts on a Saturday and ends on a Friday. So the first day is Saturday (day 1), and the last day is Friday (day 84). So in 84 days, there are 12 full weeks, but since the first day is Saturday and the last day is Friday, the number of Fridays is 12 + 1 = 13? Wait, no. Wait, in 84 days, if you have 12 weeks, each week has one Friday. So 12 Fridays. But according to the actual count, there are 13. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 84. Let me check again. Let's count the days from April 9 to July 1.\n\nApril 9 to April 30: 22 days. May has 31 days, so adding 31 days. June has 30 days, adding 30 days. July 1 is 1 day. So 22 + 31 = 53, plus 30 is 83, plus 1 is 84. So that's 84 days. But according to the day count, there are 13 Fridays. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe the error is in the assumption that 84 days is exactly 12 weeks. But 7 days per week, 12 weeks is 84 days. So that would mean that there are 12 Fridays. But according to the actual count, there are 13. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, one of the methods must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total days is not 84. Let me check the actual dates again. Let's take April 9 as day 1 (Saturday). Then day 7 is April 15 (Friday). Day 14 is April 22 (Friday). Day 21 is April 29 (Friday). Day 28 is May 5 (Friday). Day 35 is May 12 (Friday). Day 42 is May 19 (Friday). Day 49 is May 26 (Friday). Day 56 is June 2 (Friday). Day 63 is June 9 (Friday). Day 70 is June 16 (Friday). Day 77 is June 23 (Friday). Day 84 is July 1 (Friday). So that's 13 Fridays. But according to the total days, 84 days, which is 12 weeks. So why is there 13 Fridays?\n\nAh! Because the first day is Saturday, and the last day is Friday. So in 84 days, the first day is Saturday, and the last day is Friday. So the number of Fridays is 12 + 1 = 13? Wait, no. Because in 84 days, if you start on Saturday, then the first Friday is day 7, and the last Friday is day 84. So the number of Fridays is (84 - 7)/7 + 1 = (77)/7 + 1 = 11 + 1 = 12. Wait, that's 12. But according to the day count, there are 13. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe the formula is wrong. Let me think. The number of Fridays between day 1 (Saturday) and day 84 (Friday) is the number of days that are congruent to 0 mod 7 (since day 7 is the first Friday). Wait, day 1 is Saturday (0 mod 7?), but maybe I need to think in terms of days of the week.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the first Friday as day 7 (Friday), then day 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84. That's 12 Fridays. Wait, but according to the previous count, there are 13. So where is the error?\n\nWait, when I listed the days, I had:\n\nApril 15 (day 7), 22 (14), 29 (21), May 6 (28), 13 (35), 20 (42), 27 (49), June 3 (56), 10 (63), 17 (70), 24 (77), 31 (84), July 1 (84). Wait, but June 31 is day 84? Wait, no. Wait, June 31 is day 84? Let me check again.\n\nWait, April 9 is day 1. April 15 is day 7. April 22 is day 14. April 29 is day 21. May 6 is day 28.

Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should check if the dates are correct. Wait, the start date is October 24, 2022, which is a Monday. The end date is January 16, 2022, which is also a Monday. But wait, January 16, 2022, is actually before October 24, 2022. That can't be right. Wait, maybe there's a typo in the question? Because January 16 is earlier than October 24. So maybe the end date is supposed to be later? Or maybe it's a mistake in the question. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"from Monday, October 24, 2022 to Monday, January 16, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)\".

Or maybe the start date is supposed to be earlier? Because otherwise, the period would be negative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual dates. October 24, 2022 is a Monday. January 16, 2022 is a Monday. But January 16 is earlier than October 24. So the period from October 24 to January 16 would be going backward in time. That doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the question. Maybe the end date is supposed to be January 16, 2023? Let me check that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023. Let me confirm. If that's the case, then the period would be from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023. But the original question says 2022. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the start date is supposed to be January 16, 2022, and the end date is October 24, 2022? But the user wrote the start date as October 24 and end as January 16. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. Let me check the actual dates again. October 24, 2022 is a Monday. January 16, 2022 is a Monday. But that's not possible because January 16 is earlier than October 24. So the period would be from a later date to an earlier one. Therefore, the correct way is to reverse the dates. So maybe the user intended to ask from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022? But that's not what's written. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the year. Let me check the actual dates. Let me check the calendar for 2022.

But the user wrote the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023. Let me check that. January 16, 2023 is a Monday. So if the start date is October 24, 2022, and the end date is January 16, 2023, that would make sense. But the user wrote 2022 for both. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the dates. But since I have to work with the given dates, I need to proceed. However, if the start date is after the end date, then the period is invalid. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to reverse the dates. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023.

January 16, 2022 is a Monday. But that's not possible because January 16 is earlier than October 24. Therefore, the correct way is to calculate from January 16, 2022, to October 24, 2022. But the user wrote the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023. Let me check that. January 16, 2023 is a Monday. So if the start date is October 24, 2022, and the end date is January 16, 2023, that would be a valid period. \n\nBut since the user wrote both dates as 2022, I need to check if there's a mistake. However, given that the user might have made a typo, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the dates as given, but since the start date is after the end date, the answer would be zero. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023. Let me proceed with that assumption. \n\nSo, assuming the correct period is from October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2023, inclusive. Let's calculate the number of business days between those dates. \n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total number of days between October 24, 2022, and January 16, 2023, inclusive. Then subtract the weekends. \n\nAlternatively, I can break it down into months. \n\nOctober 24, 2022, to October 31, 2022: October has 31 days. From October 24 to October 31 is 8 days (including both dates). But wait, October 24 is a Monday. October 25 is Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So from October 24 to October 31 inclusive is 8 days. But business days would be Monday (24), Tuesday (25), Wednesday (26), Thursday (27), Friday (28). So that's 5 business days. Then October 31 is a Monday. \n\nThen November 2022: November has 30 days. November 1 is a Tuesday (since October 31 is a Monday). So November 1 is Tuesday. So November 1 to November 30. Let's count the business days. \n\nNovember has 30 days. From November 1 (Tuesday) to November 30 (Wednesday). Let's calculate the number of weeks. November has 30 days. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, plus 2 days. So business days would be 4 weeks * 5 days = 20, plus the two days. But since November 1 is Tuesday, the first two days are Tuesday and Wednesday. So that's 2 business days. So total business days in November would be 20 + 2 = 22? Wait, no. Wait, 30 days in November. Let me count the number of weeks. \n\nWait, November 1 is Tuesday. So the first week (November 1-7) has 5 business days (Tuesday to Saturday). Then November 8-14: 5 business days. November 15-21: 5 business days. November 22-28: 5 business days. November 29-30: 2 days (Tuesday and Wednesday). So total business days in November would be 4 weeks (20 days) plus 2 days = 22. \n\nThen December 2022: December has 31 days. December 1 is a Thursday (since November 30 is a Wednesday). So December 1 is Thursday. December 1 to December 31. Let's count the business days. \n\nDecember has 31 days. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks is 28 days, plus 3 days. The first week (Dec 1-7): Thursday to Monday (but Monday is business day). Wait, December 1 is Thursday. So the first week: Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4), Monday (5). So 5 business days. Then Dec 6-12: 5 business days. Dec 13-19: 5 business days. Dec 20-26: 5 business days. Dec 27-31: 5 days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday). Wait, Dec 27 is Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So that's 5 business days. So total business days in December would be 5 weeks (20 days) plus 5 days = 25? Wait, 4 weeks (28 days) plus 3 days (Dec 27-31) is 31 days. But the business days would be 4 weeks * 5 = 20, plus 3 days (Thursday, Friday, Monday). Wait, but Dec 27 is Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So that's 3 business days (Thursday, Friday, Monday). Wait, that's 3 days. So total business days in December would be 20 + 3 = 23? Wait, no. Wait, the first week (Dec 1-7) has 5 business days. Then Dec 8-14: 5 business days. Dec 15-21: 5. Dec 22-28: 5. Dec 29-31: 3 business days (29 is Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday). Wait, that's 3 business days. So total is 5*4 + 3 = 23. \n\nThen January 2023: January 1 is a Sunday (since December 31 is a Monday). Wait, December 31, 2022 is a Monday. So January 1, 2023 is a Tuesday? Wait, no. Wait, December 31 is a Monday. So January 1 is a Tuesday. Wait, that's correct. So January 1 is Tuesday. The end date is January 16, 2023, which is a Monday. \n\nSo January 1 (Tuesday) to January 16 (Monday). Let's count the business days. \n\nJanuary 1 is Tuesday, 2 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, 8 Tuesday, 9 Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday, 13 Sunday, 14 Monday, 15 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday. Wait, but the end date is January 16, which is a Monday. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check. \n\nWait, December 31, 2022 is a Monday. So January 1, 2023 is a Tuesday. Then January 1 is Tuesday, 2 Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday, 8 Tuesday, 9 Wednesday, 10 Thursday, 11 Friday, 12 Saturday, 13 Sunday, 14 Monday, 15 Tuesday, 16 Wednesday. Wait, but the end date is January 16, which is a Wednesday. But the user said the end date is a Monday. That's a problem. So maybe my assumption that the end date is January 16, 2023 is incorrect. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check the actual calendar. Let me check the actual dates. \n\nLet me check the day of the week for January 16, 2023. According to online sources, January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous step. \n\nWait, December 31, 2022 is a Saturday? Wait, no. Let me check. October 24, 2022 is a Monday. Let me check the actual calendar. \n\nWait, October 24, 2022 is a Monday. October 25 is Tuesday, 26 Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So October 31 is a Monday. November 1 is Tuesday. November 2 is Wednesday, 3 Thursday, 4 Friday, 5 Saturday, 6 Sunday, 7 Monday. November 7 is Monday. November 8 is Tuesday. November 15 is Monday. November 15 is Monday. November 16 is Tuesday. November 22 is Monday. November 23 is Tuesday. November 29 is Monday. November 30 is Tuesday. December 1 is Wednesday. December 2 is Thursday, 3 Friday, 4 Saturday, 5 Sunday, 6 Monday, 7 Tuesday, 8 Wednesday, 9 Thursday, 10 Friday, 11 Saturday, 12 Sunday, 13 Monday, 14 Tuesday, 15 Wednesday, 16 Thursday, 17 Friday, 18 Saturday, 19 Sunday, 20 Monday, 21 Tuesday, 22 Wednesday, 23 Thursday, 24 Friday, 25 Saturday, 26 Sunday, 27 Monday, 28 Tuesday, 29 Wednesday, 30 Thursday, 31 Friday. So December 31, 2022 is a Friday. Therefore, January 1, 2023 is a Saturday. \n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. So December 31, 2022 is a Friday. Therefore, January 1, 2023 is a Saturday. Then January 1 is Saturday, 2 Sunday, 3 Monday, 4 Tuesday, 5 Wednesday, 6 Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, 11 Tuesday, 12 Wednesday, 13 Thursday, 14 Friday, 15 Saturday, 16 Sunday.

Wait, but if the end date is January 16, 2022, that's earlier than October 24, 2022. So the period is invalid. \n\nThis is very confusing. I think the user made a mistake in the dates. But since the user provided the dates as October 24, 2022, to January 16, 2022, inclusive, which is invalid, I need to check if there's a way to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to write the end date as January 16, 2023. Let me check that. If the end date is January 16, 2023, which is a Sunday. Wait, according to the previous calculation, January 1, 2023 is a Saturday. So January 16, 2023 is a Sunday.

If the start date is after the end date, then the number of business days is zero.

Wait, but how do I confirm that? Maybe I can use some known dates. For example, I know that January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Let me check that. If January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, then counting backwards, December 31, 2022 would be a Saturday. Then November 30, 2022 would be a Thursday. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, I can use the fact that October 1, 2022 is a known date. But since I don't have a calendar here, maybe I can use some other method. Let me think about the days of the week. If I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then October 2 would be Sunday, and so on. But how do I verify this? Maybe I can check a reference. Wait, I think I remember that October 1, 2022 was indeed a Saturday. Alternatively, I can use the fact that January 1, 2023 is a Sunday. Let me count the days between October 1, 2022 and January 1, 2023. October has 31 days, so from October 1 to October 31 is 30 days. Then November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So total days from October 1 to January 1 is 30 + 30 + 31 = 91 days. 91 days later is January 1, 2023. If October 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then adding 91 days (which is 13 weeks exactly) would bring us to the same day of the week. So January 1, 2023 would be a Saturday. But I thought January 1, 2023 was a Sunday. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the days between October 1 and January 1. October has 31 days, so from October 1 to October 31 is 30 days (since October 1 is the starting day). Then November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So total days from October 1 to January 1 is 30 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 91 days. 91 divided by 7 is 13 weeks. So if October 1 is a Saturday, then adding 91 days would be the same day of the week. But if January 1, 2023 is a Sunday, that would mean that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the dates. Let me check another way. Let's take a known date. For example, I know that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But how can I be sure? Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 1, 2021 was a Saturday. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think of another approach. Maybe using the fact that March 1, 2022 was a Monday. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can use the fact that I remember that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to be certain. Alternatively, I can use the fact that if I know that October 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then October 8, 2022 is also a Saturday. Then October 15, 21, 28, etc. But I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that November 4, 2022 was a Friday. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can use the fact that December 24, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe I should just rely on my memory. I think October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, I can use the fact that October 1, 2022 was a Saturday. So the answer is Saturday.", "Saturday"], [124, "Count the occurrences of Saturday from Wednesday, September 21 to Wednesday, November 30, 2022 (including both start and end dates). Respond with just the number.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to count how many Saturdays fall between Wednesday, September 21, 2022, and Wednesday, November 30, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. First, I should figure out the dates and check each Saturday in that range.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The start is September 21, 2022, which is a Wednesday. The end is November 30, 2022, also a Wednesday. So the period is exactly 3 months, but not sure if it's exactly 90 days or not. Wait, September has 30 days, October has 31, November has 30. So from September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (including both start and end?), wait no. Wait, if I start on the 21st, then the next day is 22nd, so from 21 to 30 is 10 days (21,22,...,30). Then October has 31 days, and November has 30. So total days from September 21 to November 30 inclusive would be 10 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 30 (Nov) = 71 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (since 30-21+1=10). Then October is 31 days, November is 30 days. So total days is 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. So the total number of days between the two dates is 71 days.\n\nNow, I need to count how many Saturdays are in those 71 days. Since the start date is a Wednesday, let's see. Let's list the days of the week for each date.\n\nStarting on September 21, 2022 (Wednesday). Let's count the days step by step.\n\nFirst, the first day is Wednesday. Then the next day is Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So the first Saturday in the period is September 22 (since 21 is Wednesday, 22 is Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday? Wait wait, wait. Wait, September 21 is Wednesday. So September 21 is Wednesday. Then September 22 is Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday. So the first Saturday is September 24. Wait, but wait, maybe I should check that. Let me confirm. Let me check the actual calendar for 2022. Wait, I can't look it up, but I need to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of weeks and days. Since the total days are 71, that's 10 weeks and 1 day (since 7*10=70, 71-70=1). So if the first day is Wednesday, then the next day is Thursday, and so on. So in 70 days, there would be 10 weeks, so 10 Saturdays. Then the 71st day is the next day after that, which is Wednesday again (since 70 days later is the same day of the week). Wait, but the start date is Wednesday, so adding 70 days would bring us back to Wednesday. Then the 71st day is Thursday. Wait, but the end date is November 30, which is a Wednesday. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe my calculation of the total days is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let's calculate the number of days between September 21 and November 30 inclusive. Let's do it step by step.\n\nSeptember has 30 days. From September 21 to September 30 is 30 - 21 + 1 = 10 days. Then October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. So total days is 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. So that's correct. So the total number of days is 71. Now, if the first day is Wednesday, then the last day is 71 days later. Let's check what day of the week that is. Since 71 divided by 7 is 10 weeks and 1 day. So adding 70 days (10 weeks) brings us back to Wednesday. Then adding 1 more day (the 71st day) would be Thursday. But the end date is November 30, which is a Wednesday. That's a contradiction. So my calculation must be wrong. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the total days.\n\nWait, maybe the end date is not 71 days after the start date. Let me check again. Let's count the days from September 21 to November 30 inclusive. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom September 21 to September 30: 30 - 21 + 1 = 10 days (including both start and end).\n\nOctober has 31 days, so adding 31 days.\n\nNovember has 30 days, adding 30 days.\n\nTotal is 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. So that's correct. But if the start date is Wednesday, then adding 70 days (10 weeks) would be Wednesday again. Then adding 1 more day (the 71st day) would be Thursday. But the end date is November 30, which is a Wednesday. So that's a problem. Therefore, my assumption that the start date is Wednesday must be wrong. Wait, but the user said that the start date is Wednesday, September 21. So maybe I need to check that.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual day of the week for September 21, 2022. Let me think. Let's take a known date. For example, January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. Wait, I think that's correct. So January 1, 2022 is Sunday. Then, let's count the days. Let's see, September 21, 2022. Let's calculate the number of days from January 1 to September 21.\n\nJanuary has 31 days, February 28 (2022 is not a leap year), March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, and September 21.\n\nSo total days from Jan 1 to Sep 21 is:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 30 (Jun) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Aug) + 21 (Sep) = \n\nLet me calculate that step by step:\n\nJan: 31\n\nFeb: 31 + 28 = 59\n\nMar: 59 + 31 = 90\n\nApr: 90 + 30 = 120\n\nMay: 120 + 31 = 151\n\nJun: 151 + 30 = 181\n\nJul: 181 + 31 = 212\n\nAug: 212 + 31 = 243\n\nSep: 243 + 21 = 264 days.\n\nSo September 21, 2022 is 264 days after January 1, 2022. Since January 1, 2022 is a Sunday, then 264 days later is what day of the week?\n\nWell, 264 divided by 7 is 37 weeks and 5 days. So 37 weeks is 259 days, so 264 - 259 = 5 days. So adding 5 days to Sunday: Sunday + 1 is Monday, +2 Tuesday, +3 Wednesday, +4 Thursday, +5 Friday. Wait, that would make September 21, 2022 a Friday? But the user said it's a Wednesday. That's conflicting. So there's a mistake here. Therefore, my calculation of the number of days from Jan 1 to Sep 21 must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in adding. Let me check again:\n\nJanuary: 31\n\nFebruary: 28 (2022 is not a leap year)\n\nMarch: 31\n\nApril: 30\n\nMay: 31\n\nJune: 30\n\nJuly: 31\n\nAugust: 31\n\nSeptember: 21\n\nSo adding them up:\n\n31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) = 59\n\n59 + 31 (Mar) = 90\n\n90 + 30 (Apr) = 120\n\n120 + 31 (May) = 151\n\n151 + 30 (Jun) = 181\n\n181 + 31 (Jul) = 212\n\n212 + 31 (Aug) = 243\n\n243 + 21 (Sep) = 264. So that's correct. So 264 days from Jan 1, 2022 (Sunday) is 264 days later. 264 divided by 7 is 37 weeks and 5 days. So 37 weeks is 259 days. 264 - 259 = 5 days. So Sunday + 5 days is Friday. So September 21, 2022 is a Friday. But the user said it's a Wednesday. That's a problem. Therefore, either the user is wrong, or my calculation is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the day of the week for January 1, 2022.\n\nWait, I think I remember that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Let me check that. For example, January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 started on a Saturday? Wait, no. Wait, if 2021 started on Friday, then 2022 would start on Saturday. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Wait, maybe I need to check that again.\n\nWait, let's check the actual day of the week for January 1, 2022. According to online sources, January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous assumption. So maybe I was wrong earlier. So if January 1, 2022 is a Saturday, then 264 days later would be 264 days after Saturday. Let's calculate that.\n\n264 divided by 7 is 37 weeks and 5 days. So 37 weeks is 259 days. 264 - 259 = 5 days. So Saturday + 5 days is Thursday. Wait, that would make September 21, 2022 a Thursday. But the user said it's a Wednesday. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates. Let me think. For example, September 21, 2022. Let me check what day of the week that was. According to my knowledge, September 21, 2022 was a Wednesday. So perhaps my calculation of the day of the week for January 1, 2022 is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I think I might have confused the years. Let me check. For example, January 1, 2020 was a Wednesday. Then 2020 had 366 days (leap year). So 2021 started on a Thursday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So 2022 started on a Friday. Wait, that would mean January 1, 2022 was a Friday. Then 264 days later would be 264 days after Friday. 264 divided by 7 is 37 weeks and 5 days. So Friday + 5 days is Wednesday. So that would make September 21, 2022 a Wednesday. That matches the user's statement. So my earlier mistake was in the day of the week for January 1, 2022. So that's fixed now.\n\nSo the start date is Wednesday, September 21, 2022. The end date is Wednesday, November 30, 2022. Now, the total number of days between them is 71 days. Let's confirm that again. September 21 to September 30 is 10 days. October has 31 days, November has 30 days. So 10 + 31 + 30 = 71 days. So that's correct.\n\nNow, since the start date is Wednesday, the first Saturday in the period is September 24 (since 21 is Wednesday, 22 Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday). Then the next Saturday is October 1, 2022 (since October 1 is a Saturday? Wait, let's check. If September 24 is Saturday, then September 25 is Sunday, 26 Monday, 27 Tuesday, 28 Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. Then October 1 is Saturday. So yes, October 1 is Saturday. Then the next Saturday is October 8, 15, 22, 29. Then November 5, 12, 19, 26. Then December 3, but that's beyond the end date of November 30. So let's list all the Saturdays in the period.\n\nStarting from September 24, 2022 (Saturday), then:\n\nSeptember 24\n\nOctober 1\n\nOctober 8\n\nOctober 15\n\nOctober 22\n\nOctober 29\n\nNovember 5\n\nNovember 12\n\nNovember 19\n\nNovember 26\n\nThat's 10 Saturdays. Wait, that's 10 Saturdays. But let me count again:\n\n1. September 24\n\n2. October 1\n\n3. October 8\n\n4. October 15\n\n5. October 22\n\n6. October 29\n\n7. November 5\n\n8. November 12\n\n9. November 19\n\n10. November 26\n\nYes, that's 10 Saturdays. So the answer should be 10. But wait, the end date is November 30, which is a Wednesday. So November 26 is a Saturday, and the next Saturday would be December 3, which is outside the range. So yes, 10 Saturdays in total. Therefore, the answer is 10.", "10"], [124, "In a year where Tuesday is January 1st, name the weekday of April 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where January 1st is a Tuesday, what day of the week is April 3rd? I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and April 3rd. Let me break it down month by month. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question just says \"a year where Tuesday is January 1st.\" It doesn't mention leap year. But since the problem is about April 3rd, which is after February, maybe I need to assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that it doesn't matter? Wait, no, because if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says \"in a year where Tuesday is January 1st.\" So the year could be a leap year or not. But since the problem is solvable, maybe the answer is the same regardless. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think. Let's assume it's a non-leap year first. So February has 28 days. Then March has 31 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days into April.\n\nSo total days from January 1st to April 3rd would be:\n\nJanuary: 31 days, so from Jan 1 to Jan 31 is 30 days (since Jan 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March has 31 days, so adding 31 days. Then April 3rd is 3 days. Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 2 is Wednesday, etc. So to find the day of the week for April 3, I need to calculate the total number of days between January 1 and April 3, then take that number modulo 7, and add it to Tuesday.\n\nWait, but how many days are between January 1 and April 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days (since January 1 is day 0). Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year), March has 31 days. Then April 3 is 3 days into April. So total days from January 1 to April 3 is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 3 (Apr) = 30 + 28 is 58, plus 31 is 89, plus 3 is 92 days. Wait, but that would be 92 days after January 1. Wait, but if January 1 is day 0, then January 2 is day 1, etc. So April 3 is day 92. Then 92 days later. Now, since each week has 7 days, 92 divided by 7 gives how many weeks and days. Let me calculate 92 divided by 7. 7*13 is 91, so 92 is 13 weeks and 1 day. So 92 days later is 13 weeks and 1 day. So if January 1 is Tuesday, then adding 1 day would be Wednesday. So April 3 would be Wednesday? Wait, but that seems too easy. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of days.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let's count the days step by step.\n\nJanuary 1 is day 0 (Tuesday). Then January 1 + 1 day is January 2 (Wednesday). So to get to April 3, how many days is that?\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days. Then March has 31 days, adding 31 days. Then April 3 is 3 days. So total days from January 1 to April 3 is 30 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 92 days. Wait, but that's 92 days after January 1. So 92 days later. So 92 divided by 7 is 13 weeks (91 days) and 1 day. So 92 days later is 1 day after Tuesday, which is Wednesday. So April 3 would be Wednesday. But wait, that seems correct? But maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count the number of days from January 1 to April 3 inclusive? Wait, no. Because if January 1 is day 0, then the next day is day 1. So the number of days between January 1 and April 3 is 92 days. So adding 92 days to Tuesday. But 92 mod 7 is 1, so Tuesday + 1 day is Wednesday. So the answer would be Wednesday. But wait, maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days for each month. Let's see:\n\nJanuary 1 is Tuesday. Let's count the days for each month:\n\nJanuary has 31 days. So January 1 is Tuesday. Then January 8 is Tuesday again (7 days later). So January 1 + 7 days is Tuesday. So January 8 is Tuesday. Then January 15, 22, 29 are Tuesdays. Then February 5 is Tuesday. Then February 12, 19, 26 are Tuesdays. March 5, 12, 19, 26 are Tuesdays. April 2 is Tuesday. Then April 3 is Wednesday. Wait, that seems to match. So April 3 is Wednesday. So that's the same answer as before. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, if February has 28 days, then February 28 is the last day of February. So if February 26 is a Tuesday, then February 27 is Wednesday, 28 is Thursday. Then March 1 is Friday. Then March 5 is Tuesday again. Then March 12, 19, 26 are Tuesdays. Then April 2 is Tuesday, so April 3 is Wednesday. So that's correct. So the answer is Wednesday.

First, I should figure out the dates and check which ones are Saturdays.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the dates. The start date is June 30, 2022, which is a Thursday. The end date is September 6, 2022, which is a Tuesday. So the period includes from June 30 to September 6, inclusive. Now, I need to count all the Saturdays in this range.\n\nLet me start by checking the first day, June 30, 2022. That's a Thursday. So the next day, July 1, 2022, is a Friday. Then July 2 is a Saturday. So that's the first Saturday in the range. Then every 7 days after that would be another Saturday.\n\nSo let's list out the Saturdays in each month. Let's break it down by month.\n\nFirst, June: The start date is June 30, which is a Thursday. The next Saturday would be July 2. So June only has one Saturday in this period? Wait, June 30 is Thursday, so the last Saturday in June would be June 25, 2022. Wait, no, wait. Wait, June 30 is Thursday. Let me check the days of the week for June 2022.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the actual dates. Let me think. June 30, 2022 is a Thursday. So June 23 is a Thursday, then June 24 is Friday, June 25 is Saturday. Then June 26 is Sunday, 27 Monday, 28 Tuesday, 29 Wednesday, 30 Thursday. So the last Saturday in June is June 25, 2022. But since our start date is June 30, which is Thursday, the first Saturday in the period is July 2. So June only has one Saturday in the range? Wait, no. Wait, the period starts on June 30, so the Saturday in June that is after June 30 would be July 2. So June 25 is before June 30, so it's not included. Therefore, in June, there are no Saturdays in the range. So the first Saturday is July 2.\n\nNow, July. Let's see. July 2 is a Saturday. Then July 9, 16, 23, 30. So that's five Saturdays in July. Let me check: July has 31 days. So July 2 is Saturday, then adding 7 days each time. 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five Saturdays. Then August. August 1, 2022 is a Monday. So the first Saturday in August would be August 6. Then 13, 20, 27. That's four Saturdays. Then September. September 1, 2022 is a Thursday. So the first Saturday in September would be September 2. Then 9, 16, 23, 30. But the end date is September 6. So September 2 is a Saturday, but September 6 is a Tuesday. So in September, only September 2 is included. Wait, September 2 is a Saturday. Then September 9 is after September 6, so not included. So that's one Saturday in September.\n\nSo adding them up: July has 5, August has 4, September has 1. Total is 5 + 4 + 1 = 10. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nWait, let me check each month again. July: 2, 9, 16, 23, 30. That's five. August: 6, 13, 20, 27. Four. September: 2. So total 5+4+1=10. But wait, the end date is September 6. So September 2 is included, but September 6 is the end date. So that's correct. So total of 10 Saturdays. But wait, let me check if there's any other Saturday in July or August that I might have missed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between June 30 and September 6, then divide by 7 and adjust for the start and end days. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can check each month's dates again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual dates using a calendar. But since I can't access external resources, I need to rely on my knowledge.\n\nWait, June 30 is Thursday. July 1 is Friday, July 2 is Saturday. Then July 9 is Saturday, 16, 23, 30. That's five. Then August 6 is Saturday. August 13, 20, 27. That's four. Then September 2 is Saturday. So that's 5+4+1=10. So the answer should be 10.

I need to find out how many business days there are from Sunday, July 17, 2022, to Tuesday, August 23, 2022, inclusive. Business days are Monday through Friday, so weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are excluded.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between the two dates, including both start and end dates. Then subtract the weekends.\n\nLet me start by checking the dates. July 17, 2022 is a Sunday. The end date is August 23, 2022, which is a Tuesday. Let me confirm the days of the week for these dates to make sure. Wait, July 17 is a Sunday. Let me check the next days. July 18 is Monday, 19 Tuesday, 20 Wednesday, 21 Thursday, 22 Friday, 23 Saturday, 24 Sunday, and so on. So from July 17 to August 23, inclusive, how many days is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total days between the two dates. Let's break it down by months. July has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31 is 31 - 17 = 14 days, but since July 17 is included, that's 14 days (including July 17). Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total days would be 14 + 23 = 37 days. Wait, but let me check that again. Wait, July 17 to July 31 inclusive: July 17 is day 1, July 18 is day 2, ..., July 31 is day 15 (since 31-17+1=15). Then August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total days would be 15 + 23 = 38 days. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. Which is correct?\n\nWait, the formula for the number of days between two dates inclusive is (end date - start date) + 1. So if I calculate the number of days from July 17 to July 31, that's 31 - 17 + 1 = 15 days. Then from August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. So total is 15 + 23 = 38 days. So total days between July 17 and August 23 inclusive is 38 days.\n\nNow, out of these 38 days, how many are weekends? Let's list the days. Starting from July 17 (Sunday), then July 18 (Monday), 19 (Tuesday), 20 (Wednesday), 21 (Thursday), 22 (Friday), 23 (Saturday), 24 (Sunday), 25 (Monday), 26 (Tuesday), 27 (Wednesday), 28 (Thursday), 29 (Friday), 30 (Saturday), 31 (Sunday). Then August 1 (Monday), 2 (Tuesday), 3 (Wednesday), 4 (Thursday), 5 (Friday), 6 (Saturday), 7 (Sunday), 8 (Monday), 9 (Tuesday), 10 (Wednesday), 11 (Thursday), 12 (Friday), 13 (Saturday), 14 (Sunday), 15 (Monday), 16 (Tuesday), 17 (Wednesday), 18 (Thursday), 19 (Friday), 20 (Saturday), 21 (Sunday), 22 (Monday), 23 (Tuesday).\n\nNow, let's count the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in this period. Let's go through each week.\n\nFirst, July 17 is Sunday. Then the next Saturday is July 23. Then Sunday July 24. Then Saturday August 6, Sunday August 7. Then Saturday August 13, Sunday August 14. Then Saturday August 20, Sunday August 21. Then Saturday August 27, but that's beyond August 23. So the weekends in the period are:\n\nJuly 17 (Sunday), July 23 (Saturday), July 24 (Sunday), August 6 (Saturday), August 7 (Sunday), August 13 (Saturday), August 14 (Sunday), August 20 (Saturday), August 21 (Sunday). Wait, but August 23 is the end date, which is Tuesday. So the last weekend would be August 21 (Sunday) and August 20 (Saturday). Let me check each day:\n\nFrom July 17 to August 23:\n\nSundays: July 17, 24, 31 (but August 31 is beyond the end date). Wait, August 23 is the end date. So Sundays in the period are July 17, 24, and August 7, 14, 21. Wait, August 21 is a Sunday. Then August 28 would be the next Sunday, but that's after August 23. So Sundays are July 17, 24, 7, 14, 21. That's 5 Sundays.\n\nSaturdays: July 23, 30 (but July 30 is a Saturday. Wait, July 30 is a Saturday? Let me check. July 17 is Sunday. July 18 is Monday. July 23 is Saturday. Then July 24 is Sunday. July 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So July 30 is Saturday. Then August 6 is Saturday, 13, 20, 27. But August 27 is beyond the end date. So Saturdays in the period are July 23, 30, August 6, 13, 20. That's 5 Saturdays.\n\nSo total weekends are 5 Sundays + 5 Saturdays = 10 days. Therefore, business days would be total days (38) minus 10 weekends = 28 business days.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the weekends again. Let's list all the dates from July 17 to August 23 and mark weekends.\n\nJuly 17: Sunday (weekend)\nJuly 18: Monday (business)\nJuly 19: Tuesday (business)\nJuly 20: Wednesday (business)\nJuly 21: Thursday (business)\nJuly 22: Friday (business)\nJuly 23: Saturday (weekend)\nJuly 24: Sunday (weekend)\nJuly 25: Monday (business)\nJuly 26: Tuesday (business)\nJuly 27: Wednesday (business)\nJuly 28: Thursday (business)\nJuly 29: Friday (business)\nJuly 30: Saturday (weekend)\nJuly 31: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 1: Monday (business)\nAugust 2: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 3: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 4: Thursday (business)\nAugust 5: Friday (business)\nAugust 6: Saturday (weekend)\nAugust 7: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 8: Monday (business)\nAugust 9: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 10: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 11: Thursday (business)\nAugust 12: Friday (business)\nAugust 13: Saturday (weekend)\nAugust 14: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 15: Monday (business)\nAugust 16: Tuesday (business)\nAugust 17: Wednesday (business)\nAugust 18: Thursday (business)\nAugust 19: Friday (business)\nAugust 20: Saturday (weekend)\nAugust 21: Sunday (weekend)\nAugust 22: Monday (business)\nAugust 23: Tuesday (business)\n\nNow, let's count the weekends. The weekends are:\n\nJuly 17, 23, 24, 30, 31, 6, 7, 13, 14, 20, 21. Wait, that's 11 days. Wait, earlier I thought 10, but here it's 11. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nJuly 17 (Sunday) - 1\nJuly 23 (Saturday) - 2\nJuly 24 (Sunday) - 3\nJuly 30 (Saturday) - 4\nJuly 31 (Sunday) - 5\nAugust 6 (Saturday) - 6\nAugust 7 (Sunday) - 7\nAugust 13 (Saturday) - 8\nAugust 14 (Sunday) - 9\nAugust 20 (Saturday) - 10\nAugust 21 (Sunday) - 11\n\nSo that's 11 weekend days. Therefore, total business days would be 38 total days minus 11 weekends = 27 business days. But wait, this contradicts my previous count. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, the total days from July 17 to August 23 inclusive is 38 days. Let me check that again. July 17 to July 31 is 15 days (31-17+1=15). August 1 to August 23 is 23 days. 15+23=38. Correct. So 38 days total.\n\nBut according to the list above, there are 11 weekend days. So 38-11=27 business days. But earlier I thought 10 weekends, but that was wrong. So the correct number is 27?\n\nWait, but let me check the list again. Let me count the weekends again:\n\nJuly 17 (Sunday) - 1\nJuly 23 (Saturday) - 2\nJuly 24 (Sunday) - 3\nJuly 30 (Saturday) - 4\nJuly 31 (Sunday) - 5\nAugust 6 (Saturday) - 6\nAugust 7 (Sunday) - 7\nAugust 13 (Saturday) - 8\nAugust 14 (Sunday) - 9\nAugust 20 (Saturday) - 10\nAugust 21 (Sunday) - 11\n\nYes, that's 11 weekends. So 38-11=27 business days. But wait, the end date is August 23, which is a Tuesday. So August 23 is included. Let me check if August 23 is a Tuesday. Let me check the days again. July 17 is Sunday. July 18 is Monday. July 23 is Saturday. July 24 is Sunday. July 25 is Monday. July 30 is Saturday. July 31 is Sunday. August 1 is Monday. August 2 is Tuesday. August 3 is Wednesday. August 4 is Thursday. August 5 is Friday. August 6 is Saturday. August 7 is Sunday. August 8 is Monday. August 9 is Tuesday. August 10 is Wednesday. August 11 is Thursday. August 12 is Friday. August 13 is Saturday. August 14 is Sunday. August 15 is Monday. August 16 is Tuesday. August 17 is Wednesday. August 18 is Thursday. August 19 is Friday. August 20 is Saturday. August 21 is Sunday. August 22 is Monday. August 23 is Tuesday. Yes, that's correct. So August 23 is Tuesday, which is a business day. So the list of weekends is correct as 11 days. Therefore, 38-11=27 business days.\n\nBut wait, when I first thought of the weekends, I had 5 Sundays and 5 Saturdays, but that was wrong. Because in the list, there are 5 Sundays (July 17, 24, 31, 7, 14, 21) \u2014 wait, that's 6 Sundays. Wait, July 17, 24, 31 (three in July), then August 7, 14, 21 (three in August). That's 6 Sundays. And Saturdays are July 23, 30 (two in July), August 6, 13, 20 (three in August). That's 5 Saturdays. So total weekends are 6+5=11. Yes, that's correct. So 11 weekends. Therefore, 38-11=27 business days.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me count the business days directly. Let's go through each day from July 17 to August 23 and count the business days.\n\nJuly 17: Sunday (weekend) \u2192 not counted\nJuly 18: Monday (business) \u2192 1\nJuly 19: Tuesday \u2192 2\nJuly 20: Wednesday \u2192 3\nJuly 21: Thursday \u2192 4\nJuly 22: Friday \u2192 5\nJuly 23: Saturday \u2192 not\nJuly 24: Sunday \u2192 not\nJuly 25: Monday \u2192 6\nJuly 26: Tuesday \u21927\nJuly 27: Wednesday \u21928\nJuly 28: Thursday \u21929\nJuly 29: Friday \u219210\nJuly 30: Saturday \u2192 not\nJuly 31: Sunday \u2192 not\nAugust 1: Monday \u219211\nAugust 2: Tuesday \u219212\nAugust 3: Wednesday \u219213\nAugust 4: Thursday \u219214\nAugust 5: Friday \u219215\nAugust 6: Saturday \u2192 not\nAugust 7: Sunday \u2192 not\nAugust 8: Monday \u219216\nAugust 9: Tuesday \u219217\nAugust 10: Wednesday \u219218\nAugust 11: Thursday \u219219\nAugust 12: Friday \u219220\nAugust 13: Saturday \u2192 not\nAugust 14: Sunday \u2192 not\nAugust 15: Monday \u219221\nAugust 16: Tuesday \u219222\nAugust 17: Wednesday \u219223\nAugust 18: Thursday \u219224\nAugust 19: Friday \u219225\nAugust 20: Saturday \u2192 not\nAugust 21: Sunday \u2192 not\nAugust 22: Monday \u219226\nAugust 23: Tuesday \u219227\n\nYes, that's 27 business days. So the answer should be 27. But I need to make sure that I didn't miss any days. Let me check the count again. From July 18 to July 22 (5 days), then July 25-29 (5 days), then August 1-5 (5 days), August 8-12 (5 days), August 15-19 (5 days), August 22-23 (2 days). Wait, that's 5+5+5+5+5+2=27. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 27.", "27"], [124, "Between Wednesday, May 18, 2022 and Friday, June 3, 2022 (counting both dates), how many times does Tuesday occur? Reply with the numerical value.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how many times Tuesday occurs between Wednesday, May 18, 2022, and Friday, June 3, 2022, inclusive. So I need to figure out all the Tuesdays in that time frame.\n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week May 18, 2022, was. Wait, the problem says that the start date is Wednesday, May 18. So that's a given. So May 18 is a Wednesday. Then I need to count all the Tuesdays from that date up to and including June 3.\n\nLet me list out the dates and days. Starting with May 18 (Wednesday). Then May 19 is Thursday, May 20 is Friday, May 21 is Saturday, May 22 is Sunday, May 23 is Monday, May 24 is Tuesday. So the first Tuesday after May 18 is May 24. Then each week after that would have another Tuesday. Let me check how many weeks are in the period.\n\nThe total number of days from May 18 to June 3 inclusive. Let me calculate that. May has 31 days. So from May 18 to May 31 is 31 - 18 + 1 = 14 days. Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. So total days is 14 + 3 = 17 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, May 18 to May 19 is 2 days, so May 18 to May 31 is 31 - 18 = 13 days, plus 1 day for the inclusive count? Wait, maybe I should calculate the total days between the two dates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just count the number of Tuesdays. Since May 18 is a Wednesday, then May 24 is the first Tuesday. Then adding 7 days each time. Let's see:\n\nMay 24 (Tuesday)\nMay 31 (Tuesday)\nJune 7 (Tuesday)\nJune 14 (Tuesday)\nJune 21 (Tuesday)\nJune 28 (Tuesday)\n\nWait, but the end date is June 3. So June 7 is beyond June 3. So the last Tuesday would be May 31. Let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, May 18 is Wednesday. Then May 24 is Tuesday. Then May 31 is the next Tuesday. Then June 7 would be the next, but June 7 is after June 3. So between May 18 and June 3, inclusive, how many Tuesdays are there?\n\nSo May 24 and May 31. That's two Tuesdays. Wait, but let me check each day.\n\nLet me list the dates:\n\nMay 18: Wednesday\nMay 19: Thursday\nMay 20: Friday\nMay 21: Saturday\nMay 22: Sunday\nMay 23: Monday\nMay 24: Tuesday (1st)\nMay 25: Wednesday\nMay 26: Thursday\nMay 27: Friday\nMay 28: Saturday\nMay 29: Sunday\nMay 30: Monday\nMay 31: Tuesday (2nd)\nJune 1: Wednesday\nJune 2: Thursday\nJune 3: Friday\n\nSo from May 18 to June 3, inclusive, the Tuesdays are May 24 and May 31. That's two Tuesdays. So the answer should be 2. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, May 24 is Tuesday. Then May 31 is the next Tuesday. Then June 7 would be the next, but that's beyond June 3. So yes, only two Tuesdays. But wait, the period includes both May 18 and June 3. So May 24 is within the range, and May 31 is also within the range. So that's two Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer is 2. But wait, maybe I should check the actual calendar for 2022 to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of days between the dates. Let me check the total number of days. From May 18 to June 3 inclusive. May has 31 days, so May 18 to May 31 is 14 days (since 31 - 18 + 1 = 14). Then June 1 to June 3 is 3 days. Total 14 + 3 = 17 days. So 17 days in total. Now, since May 18 is a Wednesday, the days of the week would cycle every 7 days. So 17 days is 2 weeks and 3 days. So starting from Wednesday, adding 17 days would end on a Saturday (since 2 weeks is 14 days, which brings it back to Wednesday, then 3 more days: Wednesday + 3 days is Saturday). So June 3 is a Friday. Wait, but according to my previous list, June 3 is a Friday. So that's correct. So in 17 days, how many Tuesdays are there?\n\nStarting from Wednesday, May 18. The first Tuesday is May 24 (7 days later). Then the next is May 31 (14 days later). Then the next would be June 7 (21 days later), which is outside the range. So that's two Tuesdays. Therefore, the answer is 2. So the answer should be 2. But wait, maybe I should check if May 31 is included. Since the end date is June 3, which is Friday. So May 31 is included. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is 2.", "2"], [124, "Count the weekdays (excluding weekends) from Sunday, April 24 to Friday, June 24, 2022 (including both start and end dates).

I need to count the number of weekdays between April 24, 2022 (Sunday) and June 24, 2022 (Friday), including both dates. Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of days between those two dates, then subtract the weekends. But maybe it's easier to count the weekdays directly. Let me check the dates.\n\nStarting on April 24, 2022, which is a Sunday. The next day, April 25 is a Monday. Then April 26 is Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday. Then April 30 is Saturday. May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, and so on until June 24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can break it down month by month. Let's start with April.\n\nApril 24 is Sunday. Let's count the days in April after that. April has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30: that's 7 days. But since April 24 is Sunday, April 25 is Monday, 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So in April, from the start date (24th) to the end of April (30th), there are 7 days. Now, how many weekdays are in that period?\n\nApril 24 is Sunday (not a weekday), 25 is Monday (count), 26 Tuesday (count), 27 Wednesday (count), 28 Thursday (count), 29 Friday (count), 30 Saturday (not). So that's 5 weekdays in April (Mon-Fri).\n\nThen May. May has 31 days. Let's see. May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday. So from May 2 to May 31, that's 30 days. Wait, but the end date is June 24. So I need to count all of May and then part of June?\n\nWait, the end date is June 24. So May is entirely included, and then June 1 to June 24. Let me check.\n\nWait, the start date is April 24 (Sunday) and end date is June 24 (Friday). So April 24 to April 30 is 7 days. Then May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days from April 24 to June 24 inclusive is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days? Wait, but that's not correct because when you add them up, April 24 to April 30 is 7 days (including both ends). Then May 1 to May 31 is 31 days. Then June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total days is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. But wait, if you include both start and end dates, that's correct. But maybe I should check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of days between the two dates and then subtract the weekends. But perhaps breaking it down into months is easier.\n\nBut maybe I should check the actual dates. Let me think again. Let's start with April 24 (Sunday) and count the weekdays.\n\nApril 24: Sunday (not counted)\nApril 25: Monday (count)\nApril 26: Tuesday (count)\nApril 27: Wednesday (count)\nApril 28: Thursday (count)\nApril 29: Friday (count)\nApril 30: Saturday (not counted)\nSo that's 5 weekdays in April.\n\nNow May. May 1 is Sunday. So May 1 is Sunday (not counted), May 2 is Monday (count), May 3 Tuesday (count), May 4 Wednesday (count), May 5 Thursday (count), May 6 Friday (count), May 7 Saturday (not), May 8 Sunday (not), and so on. So in May, each week has 5 weekdays. May has 31 days. Let's see how many weeks that is. 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days. So 4 weeks would be 28 days, which is 20 weekdays (since 4*5=20). Then the remaining 3 days are May 29 (Wednesday), May 30 (Thursday), May 31 (Friday). So that's 3 more weekdays. So total in May is 20 + 3 = 23 weekdays.\n\nThen June. June 1 is a Wednesday (since May 31 is a Tuesday, so June 1 is Wednesday). Wait, let me check that. Wait, May 31 is a Tuesday? Let me check. May 1 is Sunday. May 7 is Saturday. May 8 is Sunday. So May 31 is 31-1=30 days after May 1. 30 days is 4 weeks and 2 days. So May 1 is Sunday, May 8 is Sunday, May 15 is Sunday, May 22 is Sunday, May 29 is Sunday. Then May 30 is Monday, May 31 is Tuesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1 is Wednesday. Then June 2 is Thursday, June 3 is Friday, June 4 is Saturday, June 5 is Sunday, June 6 is Monday, etc. The end date is June 24, which is a Friday. So from June 1 to June 24, that's 24 days. Let's count the weekdays in June.\n\nJune 1: Wednesday (count)\nJune 2: Thursday (count)\nJune 3: Friday (count)\nJune 4: Saturday (not)\nJune 5: Sunday (not)\nJune 6: Monday (count)\nJune 7: Tuesday (count)\nJune 8: Wednesday (count)\nJune 9: Thursday (count)\nJune 10: Friday (count)\nJune 11: Saturday (not)\nJune 12: Sunday (not)\nJune 13: Monday (count)\nJune 14: Tuesday (count)\nJune 15: Wednesday (count)\nJune 16: Thursday (count)\nJune 17: Friday (count)\nJune 18: Saturday (not)\nJune 19: Sunday (not)\nJune 20: Monday (count)\nJune 21: Tuesday (count)\nJune 22: Wednesday (count)\nJune 23: Thursday (count)\nJune 24: Friday (count)\n\nSo from June 1 to June 24, that's 24 days. Let's count the weekdays. Let's see:\n\nWeekdays are Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri.\n\nWait, that's 24 days. Let me count how many weekdays that is. Let's group them in weeks. From June 1 to June 7 is 7 days: 3 weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri) and 4 weekends (Sat, Sun, Sat, Sun). Wait, no. June 1 is Wednesday, so June 1-7: Wed (1), Thu (2), Fri (3), Sat (4), Sun (5), Mon (6), Tue (7). So weekdays are 1,2,3,6,7. That's 5 weekdays. Then June 8-14: Wed (8), Thu (9), Fri (10), Sat (11), Sun (12), Mon (13), Tue (14). Weekdays are 8,9,10,13,14. Another 5. Then June 15-21: Wed (15), Thu (16), Fri (17), Sat (18), Sun (19), Mon (20), Tue (21). Weekdays 15,16,17,20,21. Another 5. Then June 22-24: Wed (22), Thu (23), Fri (24). That's 3 weekdays. So total in June is 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 18 weekdays.\n\nSo adding up April (5) + May (23) + June (18) = 5 + 23 is 28, plus 18 is 46. Wait, but wait, the end date is June 24, which is included. So that's correct. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the May weekdays. Let me check again. May has 31 days. May 1 is Sunday. So the first week of May is May 1 (Sun) to May 7 (Sat). Weekdays in that week are May 2-6 (Mon-Fri), that's 5 days. Then May 8-14: same, 5 weekdays. May 15-21: 5 weekdays. May 22-28: 5 weekdays. May 29-31: May 29 is Wednesday, 30 Thursday, 31 Friday. That's 3 weekdays. So total is 5*4 + 3 = 23. That's correct. So May is 23.\n\nJune is 18. April is 5. Total 5+23+18=46. But wait, the start date is April 24 (Sunday) which is not a weekday. So the first weekday is April 25 (Monday). So the count is correct. But let me check another way. Let's calculate the total number of days between April 24 and June 24 inclusive, then subtract the number of weekends.\n\nTotal days: Let's calculate the number of days between April 24 and June 24. April has 30 days, so from April 24 to April 30 is 7 days. May has 31 days. June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. So 62 days in total.\n\nNow, how many weekends are in those 62 days? Weekends are Saturday and Sunday. Let's find how many Saturdays and Sundays there are.\n\nStarting from April 24 (Sunday). Let's count the weekends.\n\nApril 24 is Sunday. Then April 25 is Monday. April 26 Tuesday, 27 Wednesday, 28 Thursday, 29 Friday, 30 Saturday. So April 30 is Saturday. Then May 1 is Sunday. May 2 is Monday. May 7 is Saturday. May 8 is Sunday. May 15 is Saturday. May 16 is Sunday. May 22 is Saturday. May 23 is Sunday. May 29 is Saturday. May 30 is Sunday. June 5 is Saturday. June 6 is Sunday. June 12 is Saturday. June 13 is Sunday. June 19 is Saturday. June 20 is Sunday. June 26 is Saturday. But the end date is June 24, so we need to check up to that.\n\nSo let's list all the Saturdays and Sundays between April 24 and June 24.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nApril 30 (Saturday)\nMay 7 (Saturday)\nMay 14 (Saturday)\nMay 21 (Saturday)\nMay 28 (Saturday)\nJune 4 (Saturday)\nJune 11 (Saturday)\nJune 18 (Saturday)\nJune 25 (Saturday) \u2013 but June 25 is beyond June 24, so not included.\n\nSo that's 8 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\nApril 24 (Sunday)\nMay 1 (Sunday)\nMay 8 (Sunday)\nMay 15 (Sunday)\nMay 22 (Sunday)\nMay 29 (Sunday)\nJune 5 (Sunday)\nJune 12 (Sunday)\nJune 19 (Sunday)\nJune 26 (Sunday) \u2013 not included.\n\nSo that's 9 Sundays.\n\nTotal weekends: 8 + 9 = 17.\n\nSo total weekdays would be total days (62) minus weekends (17) = 45. Wait, but earlier I had 46. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nHmm. So according to this method, 62 - 17 = 45. But according to the previous method, it was 5 + 23 + 18 = 46. So which is correct?\n\nLet me check the count of weekends again. Let's list all the weekends between April 24 and June 24.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nApril 30 (1)\nMay 7 (2)\nMay 14 (3)\nMay 21 (4)\nMay 28 (5)\nJune 4 (6)\nJune 11 (7)\nJune 18 (8)\nThat's 8 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\nApril 24 (1)\nMay 1 (2)\nMay 8 (3)\nMay 15 (4)\nMay 22 (5)\nMay 29 (6)\nJune 5 (7)\nJune 12 (8)\nJune 19 (9)\nThat's 9 Sundays.\n\nTotal weekends: 8 + 9 = 17. So 62 - 17 = 45. But earlier, when I counted the weekdays per month, I had 5 (April) + 23 (May) + 18 (June) = 46. So there's a conflict here. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check the June count again. June 1 is Wednesday. So June 1-24 is 24 days. Let me count the weekdays again.\n\nJune 1 (Wed) to June 24 (Fri). Let's list them:\n\nWeekdays are Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri.\n\nWait, that's 24 days. Let me count how many weekdays that is. Let's see:\n\nFrom June 1 to June 7: 5 weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue)\nJune 8-14: 5 weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue)\nJune 15-21: 5 weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri, Mon, Tue)\nJune 22-24: 3 weekdays (Wed, Thu, Fri)\n\nTotal: 5 + 5 + 5 + 3 = 18. So that's correct. So June has 18 weekdays.\n\nApril has 5, May 23, June 18. Total 46. But according to the total days minus weekends, it's 45. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 62. Let me check again. April 24 to April 30 is 7 days. May has 31 days. June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So 7 + 31 + 24 = 62. But if the start date is April 24 and end date is June 24, inclusive, then the total days should be (June 24 - April 24) + 1. Let me check that. Let's calculate the number of days between April 24 and June 24 inclusive.\n\nApril has 30 days. So from April 24 to April 30 is 7 days. May has 31 days. June 1 to June 24 is 24 days. So total is 7 + 31 + 24 = 62 days. So that's correct. So 62 days total.\n\nBut according to the weekend count, 17 weekends. So 62 - 17 = 45. But the per-month count is 46. So there's a discrepancy of 1. Where is the error?\n\nLet me check the weekends again. Maybe I missed a Saturday or Sunday.\n\nSaturdays:\n\nApril 30 (1)\nMay 7 (2)\nMay 14 (3)\nMay 21 (4)\nMay 28 (5)\nJune 4 (6)\nJune 11 (7)\nJune 18 (8)\nThat's 8 Saturdays.\n\nSundays:\n\nApril 24 (1)\nMay 1 (2)\nMay 8 (3)\nMay 15 (4)\nMay 22 (5)\nMay 29 (6)\nJune 5 (7)\nJune 12 (8)\nJune 19 (9)\nThat's 9 Sundays.\n\nTotal 17 weekends. So 62 - 17 = 45. But the per-month count is 46. So which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the per-month count is wrong. Let me check April again. April 24 is Sunday. April 25 is Monday (count), 26 Tuesday (count), 27 Wednesday (count), 28 Thursday (count), 29 Friday (count), 30 Saturday (not). So that's 5 weekdays in April. Correct.\n\nMay: 23 weekdays. Let me check again. May has 31 days. May 1 is Sunday. So the first week (May 1-7) has 5 weekdays (Mon-Fri). Then May 8-14: 5 weekdays. May 15-21: 5. May 22-28: 5. May 29-31: 3. Total 5*4 +3=23. Correct.\n\nJune: 18 weekdays. Correct.\n\nSo 5+23+18=46. But according to the total days minus weekends, it's 45. So there's a contradiction. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the total days is not 62. Let me check with another method. Let"], [124, "If today is Wednesday, March 30, 2022, what day of the week was it 2 days ago? Answer using the complete weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking, if today is Wednesday, March 30, 2022, what day of the week was it 2 days ago? And they want the complete weekday name, so I need to make sure I use the full name like \"Wednesday\" instead of just \"Wed\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what day it was two days before Wednesday. Let me count backwards. If today is Wednesday, then one day ago would be Tuesday. So two days ago would be Monday. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Today is Wednesday. Subtract one day: Tuesday. Subtract another day: Monday. Yeah, that seems correct. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify with a calendar or some other method to be sure. Let me think. March 30, 2022, is a Wednesday. Let me check what day March 29 was. If March 30 is Wednesday, then March 29 would be Tuesday. Then March 28 would be Monday. So two days ago from March 30 would be March 28, which is Monday. That matches my previous conclusion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that each week has seven days. So if I go back two days from Wednesday, it's Wednesday minus 2 days. Wednesday minus one day is Tuesday, minus another is Monday. So that's consistent. \n\nI think that's solid. So the answer should be Monday. Let me just make sure there's no leap year or something affecting the days, but since the date is March 30, 2022, and the question is about two days prior, it's just a simple subtraction.

Hmm, I need to figure out how to calculate that.\n\nFirst, I remember that weeks have 7 days, so every 7 days the same day of the week repeats. So maybe I can divide 56 by 7 to find out how many weeks that is. Let me do that: 56 divided by 7 is 8. Oh, so 56 days is exactly 8 weeks. That means 56 days ago would be the same day of the week as today. Wait, but if today is Tuesday, then 56 days ago would also be a Tuesday? But wait, maybe I need to check if there's any leap year or something affecting the date? Wait, but the problem says to answer using the complete weekday name, so maybe it's just a simple division.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should verify. Let me think. If today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022, then subtracting 7 days would take me back to February 1, 2022, which is also a Tuesday. Then subtracting another 7 days (February 1 - 7 days is January 25, 2022, also Tuesday). So each week back is still Tuesday. So 56 days is 8 weeks, so 56 days ago would be Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check if the date calculation is correct. Let me count the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use modular arithmetic. Since 56 divided by 7 is 8 with remainder 0. So 56 days ago is 0 weeks ago, which is the same day. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any error in my reasoning. For example, if the date is not exactly 56 days back, but maybe the actual date calculation is different. Wait, but the problem says that today is Tuesday, February 8, 2022. So if I go back 56 days, that's exactly 8 weeks. So the day of the week should be the same. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.", "Tuesday"], [124, "Tell me whether 1999 is a leap year. Answer with Yes or No.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if 1999 is a leap year. Let me remember the rules for leap years. From what I recall, a leap year is divisible by 4, but if it's a century year (divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. So the steps are: first check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check if it's a century year. If it is a century year, make sure it's also divisible by 400. If all those conditions are met, then it's a leap year.\n\nLet me apply this to 1999. First, divide 1999 by 4. Let's do the division: 4 times 499 is 1996, so 1999 minus 1996 is 3. That means 1999 divided by 4 is 499.75, which isn't a whole number. So 1999 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, according to the first rule, it can't be a leap year. Wait, but maybe I should check if it's a century year. Century years are every 100 years, like 1900, 2000, etc. 1999 isn't a century year because it's not divisible by 100. So even if it were divisible by 4, which it isn't, the second condition wouldn't apply. But since it's not divisible by 4 at all, the answer is no. So 1999 is not a leap year.", "No"], [124, "How many Tuesdays are there from Sunday, September 18, 2022 to Tuesday, November 15, 2022 (inclusive of both dates)?

I need to figure out how many Tuesdays there are from Sunday, September 18, 2022, to Tuesday, November 15, 2022, inclusive. Hmm. Alright, first, maybe I should check what day of the week each of these dates falls on to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Wait, the problem already says that the start date is a Sunday and the end date is a Tuesday. So that's good, I don't have to calculate that.\n\nSo the period starts on a Sunday and ends on a Tuesday. Let me think about how many weeks are in this period. Let me first figure out the total number of days between those two dates. But maybe it's easier to count the Tuesdays directly.\n\nLet me start by listing the dates. Let's break it down month by month. September 18 is a Sunday. Let's count the Tuesdays in September first. Since September 18 is a Sunday, then September 19 is a Monday, September 20 is a Tuesday. So the first Tuesday in September is the 20th. Then every 7 days after that. So the Tuesdays in September would be 20, 27. Wait, September has 30 days. So 20, 27, and then 27 +7 is 34, which is beyond September. So that's two Tuesdays in September.\n\nThen October. October 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, let me check that. Wait, September 18 is a Sunday. Let me count the days. September has 30 days. So September 18 is Sunday. September 19 is Monday, 20 Tuesday, 21 Wednesday, 22 Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday, 25 Sunday, 26 Monday, 27 Tuesday. So September 27 is Tuesday. Then October 1 is the next day, which is a Saturday. Wait, that's correct? Let me check. From September 27 (Tuesday) to September 30 is three days: Wednesday (28), Thursday (29), Friday (30). Then October 1 is Saturday. So yes, October 1 is a Saturday. So October 2 is Sunday, 3 is Monday, 4 is Tuesday. So the first Tuesday in October is the 4th. Then every 7 days: 4, 11, 18, 25. Then November 1 is a Tuesday? Wait, let's check. October has 31 days. So October 31 is a Wednesday. Then November 1 is a Thursday. Wait, that can't be. Wait, if October 1 is Saturday, then October 2 is Sunday, 3 Monday, 4 Tuesday. Then October 11 is Tuesday (4 +7). October 18 is Tuesday, October 25 is Tuesday. Then October 31 is Tuesday + 7 days? Wait, October 25 is Tuesday. October 26 is Wednesday, 27 Thursday, 28 Friday, 29 Saturday, 30 Sunday, 31 Monday. So October 31 is Monday. Then November 1 is Tuesday. So November 1 is a Tuesday. So the Tuesdays in November would be 1, 8, 15. Wait, November 15 is the end date. So that's included. So November 1, 8, 15. So that's three Tuesdays in November.\n\nSo adding up: September has 2 Tuesdays (20, 27), October has 4 Tuesdays (4, 11, 18, 25), and November has 3 Tuesdays (1, 8, 15). So total is 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 Tuesdays. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nWait, the start date is September 18 (Sunday), and the end date is November 15 (Tuesday). So let's check if all the Tuesdays I listed are within that range. September 20 and 27 are both after September 18 and before October 1. Then October 4, 11, 18, 25 are all in October. November 1, 8, 15 are in November. So that's 2+4+3=9. But wait, let me check if November 15 is included. The problem says inclusive of both dates. So November 15 is a Tuesday, so that's included. So that's correct. So total of 9 Tuesdays. Hmm. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the days of the week for October. Let me check again. Let me count the days from September 18 (Sunday) to October 1. September 18 is Sunday. September 19 is Monday, 20 Tuesday, 21 Wednesday, 22 Thursday, 23 Friday, 24 Saturday, 25 Sunday, 26 Monday, 27 Tuesday. So September 27 is Tuesday. Then September 28 is Wednesday, 29 Thursday, 30 Friday. October 1 is Saturday. So October 1 is Saturday. Then October 2 is Sunday, 3 Monday, 4 Tuesday. So that's correct. So October 4 is Tuesday. Then adding 7 days: 11, 18, 25. So that's four Tuesdays in October. Then November 1 is Tuesday. Then November 8, 15. So that's three in November. So total 2+4+3=9. So the answer should be 9. But wait, let me check another way. Let's count the total number of days between the two dates and then divide by 7, but adjust for the start and end days. Wait, the total number of days from September 18 to November 15 inclusive. Let's calculate that. September has 30 days. From September 18 to September 30 is 13 days (including September 18). Then October has 31 days, and November 1 to November 15 is 15 days. So total days: 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, September 18 to September 30 is 30 - 18 + 1 = 13 days. Then October is 31 days. Then November 1 to 15 is 15 days. So total is 13 + 31 + 15 = 59 days. So 59 days in total. Now, if there are 59 days, then the number of Tuesdays would be 59 divided by 7, but since the start day is Sunday, the first day is Sunday, so the first Tuesday is day 2 (since day 1 is Sunday, day 2 is Monday, day 3 is Tuesday). Wait, but maybe it's easier to calculate how many weeks and extra days. 59 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 3 days. So 8 weeks have 8 Tuesdays, and then the remaining 3 days would be Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. So that would add one more Tuesday. So total of 8 +1 = 9 Tuesdays. That matches the previous count. So that's 9. So the answer is 9. Therefore, the total number of Tuesdays is 9.", "9"], [124, "Determine the day of the month for the last Saturday in November 2022. Give the count numerically.

If it doesn't exist, I should answer -1. Wait, but November has 30 days, so there must be a Saturday. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what day of the week November 1, 2022, was. Maybe I can check that. Wait, I remember that November 1, 2022, was a Tuesday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then counting the days:\n\nNovember 1 is Tuesday. So the next days would be:\n\n1: Tuesday\n2: Wednesday\n3: Thursday\n4: Friday\n5: Saturday. So the first Saturday is the 5th. Then every 7 days after that. So the next Saturdays would be 5, 12, 19, 26. Then the next one would be December 3rd, which is outside of November. So the last Saturday in November would be the 26th. Wait, but let me check again. If November 5 is a Saturday, adding 7 days: 5 +7=12, 12+7=19, 19+7=26. Then 26 +7=33, which is beyond 30. So yes, the last Saturday is the 26th. Therefore, the answer should be 26. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the starting day. Let me verify. Maybe I should check an actual calendar or use another method. Alternatively, I can use the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Wait, if November 26 is a Saturday, then December 1 would be 5 days later. Let's count: November 26 (Sat), 27 (Sun), 28 (Mon), 29 (Tue), 30 (Wed), December 1 (Thu). That matches what I remember. So yes, November 26 is a Saturday. Therefore, the last Saturday in November 2022 is the 26th. So the answer is 26.", "26"], [124, "In a year where Monday is January 1st, name the weekday of March 3. Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: In a year where January 1st is a Monday, what day of the week is March 3rd? I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many days are between January 1st and March 3rd. Let's break it down. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days, but since the problem doesn't specify a leap year, I think we can assume it's a common year, so 28 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days into March. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd would be 30 (remaining days in January) + 28 (February) + 3 (March) = 61 days. Wait, but wait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, so the number of days between January 1st and March 3rd is 61 days? Let me check again. January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding that gives 30 + 28 = 58 days. Then March 3rd is 3 days after February 28th, so 58 + 3 = 61 days. So total of 61 days from January 1st to March 3rd.\n\nNow, since January 1st is a Monday, I need to find what day of the week it is 61 days later. Since the days of the week cycle every 7 days, I can divide 61 by 7 and find the remainder. That remainder will tell me how many days ahead the date is from Monday.\n\nLet me calculate 61 divided by 7. 7 times 8 is 56, so 61 - 56 is 5. So the remainder is 5. That means 61 days later is 5 days after Monday. Let's count: Monday + 1 day is Tuesday, +2 is Wednesday, +3 is Thursday, +4 is Friday, +5 is Saturday. So March 3rd should be a Saturday?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the number of days. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's count the days again. January 1st is day 0 (Monday). Then January 1st + 1 day is January 2nd (Tuesday), and so on. So March 3rd is 61 days after January 1st. Let me check another way. January has 31 days, so January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later. Then February has 28 days, so adding 28 days brings us to March 1st. Then March 3rd is 2 days after March 1st. So total days from January 1st to March 3rd is 30 + 28 + 2 = 60 days. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, if January 1st is day 0, then January 2nd is day 1, ..., January 31st is day 30. Then February 1st is day 31. February has 28 days, so February 28th is day 31 + 27 = day 58. Then March 1st is day 59, March 2nd is day 60, March 3rd is day 61. So that's correct. So March 3rd is day 61. So 61 days after Monday. So 61 divided by 7 is 8 weeks (56 days) and 5 days. So 5 days after Monday is Saturday. So the answer should be Saturday. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the day count. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days step by step. Let's start from January 1st (Monday). Let's count the days for each month. January has 31 days, so January 1st is Monday. Then January 8th is also a Monday, 15th, 22nd, 29th. Then February 5th is the next Monday. Then February 12th, 19th, 26th. Then March 5th is the next Monday. So March 5th is a Monday. Then March 3rd is two days before that. So March 5th is Monday, March 4th is Sunday, March 3rd is Saturday. That matches the previous result. So that's correct.

Weekdays are Monday through Friday, so weekends are Saturday and Sunday.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the dates involved. Let me check the dates. The start is October 11, 2022, which is a Tuesday. The end is October 20, 2022, which is a Thursday. So the period is from the 11th to the 20th, inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to count how many days are in this period and then subtract the weekends. Alternatively, I can list each day and check if it's a weekday. Let me try the first approach.\n\nFirst, calculate the total number of days between October 11 and October 20, inclusive. Let's see: from the 11th to the 20th is 10 days (since inclusive, 20-11+1=10 days). Wait, 20-11 is 9 days, plus 1 is 10 days total.

January has 31 days, so from January 1st to January 31st is 30 days later (since January 1st is day 0). Then February has 28 or 29 days. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a leap year. Hmm. Wait, the question says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So maybe it's not a leap year? Or maybe it's a leap year? Wait, but if it's a leap year, February would have 29 days. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume it's a non-leap year? Or maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, no.

Or maybe the answer is the same regardless? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's check the number of days between January 1 and March 11.\n\nSo, January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 or 29 days. Then March 11 is 11 days into March. So total days from January 1 to March 11 is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 69 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 1 is day 0, January 2 is day 1, etc. So the number of days between January 1 and March 11 is (31 - 1) days in January (since January 1 is day 0), plus 28 or 29 days in February, plus 11 days in March. Wait, no. Wait, if I want to find the number of days from January 1 to March 11 inclusive, that's 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 60 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 1, then January 1 is day 1, January 2 is day 2, etc. But the problem says that January 1 is Wednesday. So if I need to find the day of the week for March 11, I need to calculate how many days are between January 1 and March 11, then take that number modulo 7 to find the day of the week.\n\nWait, let's think of it as the number of days from January 1 to March 11. So January has 31 days, so from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days later. Then February has 28 or 29 days. Then March 11 is 11 days after February 28 or 29. So total days from January 1 to March 11 is 30 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 69 days? Wait, no. Wait, if January 1 is day 0, then January 1 is day 0, January 2 is day 1, ..., January 31 is day 30. Then February 1 is day 31, February 28 is day 31 + 27 = day 58 (if non-leap year). Then March 1 is day 59, March 11 is day 59 + 10 = day 69. So total days from January 1 to March 11 is 69 days. So 69 days later. Since January 1 is Wednesday, adding 69 days to that.\n\nNow, 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 6 days. Because 7*9=63, 69-63=6. So 6 days later. So Wednesday + 6 days. Let's count: Wednesday (0), Thursday (1), Friday (2), Saturday (3), Sunday (4), Monday (5), Tuesday (6). So adding 6 days to Wednesday would be Tuesday. Wait, but wait, if January 1 is Wednesday, then adding 1 day is Thursday, 2 days is Friday, etc. So 6 days later would be Tuesday. But wait, that would mean March 11 is a Tuesday? But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the days from January 1 to March 11. Let's do it step by step. January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days (assuming non-leap year). So from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. So total days from January 1 to March 11 is 30 + 28 + 11 = 69 days. So 69 days after January 1. So 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks (63 days) and 6 days. So 6 days after Wednesday. So Wednesday + 6 days is Tuesday. But wait, that would be Tuesday. But I need to make sure that the calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the days for each month. Let's start with January 1 as Wednesday. Let's count the days for each month.\n\nJanuary 1: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 8: Wednesday (7 days later).\n\nJanuary 15: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 22: Wednesday.\n\nJanuary 29: Wednesday.\n\nThen February 5: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 12: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 19: Wednesday.\n\nFebruary 26: Wednesday.\n\nMarch 5: Wednesday.\n\nMarch 12: Wednesday.\n\nSo March 5 is Wednesday. Then March 5 + 6 days is March 11. So March 5 is Wednesday, March 6 is Thursday, 7 Friday, 8 Saturday, 9 Sunday, 10 Monday, 11 Tuesday. So March 11 is Tuesday. So that's consistent with the previous calculation. Therefore, the answer should be Tuesday.\n\nBut wait, but what if it's a leap year? Because if it's a leap year, February has 29 days. So in that case, the number of days from January 1 to March 11 would be 30 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 70 days. 70 divided by 7 is 10 weeks exactly. So 70 days later would be the same day of the week. So if January 1 is Wednesday, then 70 days later is also Wednesday. But that would mean March 11 is Wednesday. But that contradicts the previous answer. So which is correct?\n\nBut the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". It doesn't specify whether it's a leap year or not. So how do I know? Wait, but if the problem is from a standard calendar, maybe it's not a leap year. But maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same? Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps the problem assumes a non-leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then the answer would be different. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I need to assume that it's a non-leap year. Because in reality, the Gregorian calendar has leap years every 4 years, but the problem doesn't mention anything about that. So maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is the same regardless of leap year. But that's not possible. So perhaps the problem is in a non-leap year. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday. But I need to check again.\n\nWait, let's check the number of days again. If it's a non-leap year, then February has 28 days. So from January 1 to March 11 is 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 70 days? Wait, no. Wait, January has 31 days. So from January 1 to January 31 is 30 days. Then February has 28 days, so from February 1 to February 28 is 28 days. Then March 1 to March 11 is 11 days. So total is 30 + 28 + 11 = 69 days. So 69 days. 69 divided by 7 is 9 weeks and 6 days. So 6 days after Wednesday is Tuesday. So that's correct. So the answer is Tuesday.\n\nBut if it's a leap year, then February has 29 days. So from January 1 to March 11 would be 30 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 11 (Mar) = 70 days. 70 divided by 7 is 10 weeks. So 70 days later is the same day of the week. So if January 1 is Wednesday, then March 11 would be Wednesday. But since the problem doesn't specify, how can I know? Wait, but maybe the problem is set in a non-leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then the answer would be different. But the problem says \"a year where Wednesday is January 1st\". So maybe the problem is in a non-leap year. Because if it's a leap year, then the day of the week for March 11 would be different. But since the problem doesn't mention leap year, maybe it's safe to assume that it's a non-leap year. Therefore, the answer is Tuesday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that regardless of leap year, the answer is the same. But that's not possible.

So the answer should be 25. But I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the starting day. Let me check another way. Maybe I can look up the actual calendar for December 2022. Alternatively, I can use another method. \n\nAlternatively, I can check what day of the week December 1, 2022, was. Let me think. I know that January 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 2022 started on a Sunday? Let me check. Wait, January 1, 2022, was a Saturday. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the years. Let me think again. Maybe I should use a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. Let me check that. If I remember correctly, December 1, 2022, was a Thursday. So adding 7 days, the next Sunday would be the 4th. Then adding 7 days again, the 11th, 18th, 25th. So the fourth Sunday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer should be 25. But I need to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the actual calendar. Let me try to recall. For example, December 2022: the first Sunday is the 4th, then 11, 18, 25. So yes, the fourth Sunday is the 25th. Therefore, the answer is 25.", "25"], [124, "Name the day of the week for 10/01/2022. State the weekday (Monday through Sunday).", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what day of the week October 1st, 2022 was. Let me start by recalling some methods to determine the day of the week for a given date. One common way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some kind of reference date. Alternatively, I might remember that certain dates in a year fall on specific days.\n\nFirst, I know that January 1, 2022 was a Sunday. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, I think January 1, 2022 was a Saturday. Wait, maybe I should verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can use a known date that I know for sure. For example, I remember that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let me confirm that. If July 4, 2022 was a Monday, then I can count backwards or forwards from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that October 1st is 27 days after September 1st. Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, if I can find the day of the week for a known date in September or October, I can work from there.\n\nWait, let's think about the days in the month. Let's say I know that September 1, 2022 was a Thursday. Then October 1st would be 30 days later. Since 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if September 1 was a Thursday, then adding 2 days would make October 1 a Saturday. Wait, but is September 1, 2022 a Thursday?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let me think about the year 2022. I know that 2022 is not a leap year, so February had 28 days. Let me try to count the days from a known date. For example, if I know that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then I can count the days up to October 1st.\n\nWait, let me check that. If January 1, 2022 was a Saturday, then January 8th would also be a Saturday. Then January 15th, 22nd, and 29th. Then February 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th. March 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th, April 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th. May 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th. June 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th. July 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th. August 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th. September 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, October 1st. Wait, so if September 3rd was a Saturday, then September 10th would be a Saturday, and so on. So September 3rd is a Saturday. Then September 1st would be a Thursday. Therefore, October 1st is 30 days after September 1st. 30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks and 2 days. So if September 1st is a Thursday, then adding 2 days would make October 1st a Saturday. Therefore, October 1st, 2022 was a Saturday.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that my initial assumption that January 1, 2022 was a Saturday is correct. Let me check that. For example, I know that January 1, 2021 was a Friday. Then 2021 had 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day. So January 1, 2022 would be a Saturday. That seems correct. So that would mean my previous calculation is correct. Therefore, October 1st, 2022 was a Saturday.\n\nAlternatively, I can check online, but since I can't do that, I need to rely on my calculations. Another way is to use the fact that July 4, 2022 was a Monday. Let's see. July 4 is 4 days before July 8. So July 8 is a Friday. Then July 15 is a Friday, July 22 is a Friday, July 29 is a Friday. August 5 is a Friday, August 12 is a Friday, August 19 is a Friday, August 26 is a Friday. September 2 is a Friday, September 9 is a Friday, September 16 is a Friday, September 23 is a Friday, September 30 is a Friday. Then October 7 is a Friday. So October 1st would be 6 days before October 7th. So October 1st would be a Saturday. That matches my previous conclusion. Therefore, the answer is Saturday.", "Saturday"], [124, "Count forward 80 days from Wednesday, July 6, 2022 - what's the weekday? Write out the full weekday name.", "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nOkay, let's see. I need to find out what day of the week it is 80 days after Wednesday, July 6, 2022. Hmm, first, I should probably figure out the date 80 days later, then determine the weekday. But maybe there's a way to calculate the weekday without finding the exact date? Let me think.\n\nI remember that each week has 7 days, so if I divide 80 by 7, the remainder will tell me how many days ahead the weekday is. Let me do that calculation. 80 divided by 7 is 11 weeks with a remainder of 3 days. Because 7 times 11 is 77, and 80 minus 77 is 3. So, adding 3 days to Wednesday.\n\nStarting from Wednesday, adding one day is Thursday, two days is Friday, three days is Saturday. So the weekday should be Saturday. Wait, but I need to make sure that the date calculation is correct. Maybe I should check if there are any leap years or something affecting the days? Wait, 2022 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days. But since we're starting in July, maybe that's not an issue here. Let me confirm the date.\n\nJuly 6, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let me count 80 days forward. Let's break it down. July has 31 days, so from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days (31-6=25). Then August has 31 days, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 31, etc. Wait, but adding 80 days. Let me count step by step.\n\nStarting from July 6, 2022:\n\nJuly: 31 days. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days (since 31-6=25, but including the start day? Wait, no. If I start on July 6, then adding 1 day would be July 7. So from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days later. So 25 days in July. Then August has 31 days. So adding 31 days would take us to August 31. That's 25 + 31 = 56 days. Then September has 30 days, so adding 30 days would take us to September 30, which is 56 + 30 = 86 days. Wait, but we need 80 days. So 56 days is July 31 plus August 31. Wait, no. Wait, July 6 plus 25 days is July 31. Then adding 31 days (August) would be August 31, which is 25 + 31 = 56 days. Then adding 24 more days (since 80 - 56 = 24) would take us to September 24, 2022. Because September has 30 days, so 24 days into September is September 24. So the date would be September 24, 2022. Now, I need to check what day that is.\n\nBut maybe I can check the weekday. Alternatively, since I already calculated that 80 days is 11 weeks and 3 days, so adding 3 days to Wednesday would be Saturday. But maybe I should verify this with the actual date. Let me check the actual date. Wait, I can't look it up, but maybe I can use another method. Let me check the days step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that July 6, 2022 is a Wednesday. Let me check the days for the next months. For example, July 6 is Wednesday. July 13 is also Wednesday, July 20, July 27, August 3, August 10, August 17, August 24, August 31. Then September 7, 14, 21, 28. So September 28 is a Wednesday. Then September 29 is Thursday, September 30 is Friday, October 1 is Saturday. Wait, but that's if September 28 is Wednesday. Wait, but if I added 3 days to Wednesday, that would be Saturday. But according to this, September 24 would be 24 days after July 6. Wait, maybe I need to count the days properly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the fact that 80 days is 11 weeks and 3 days. So if July 6 is Wednesday, then adding 11 weeks (77 days) would be July 6 + 77 days. Let's see, July has 31 days, so July 6 + 25 days is July 31. Then adding 7 weeks (49 days) would take us to July 31 + 49 days. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 77 days is 11 weeks. So adding 77 days to July 6 would be July 6 + 77 days. Let me calculate that. July has 31 days, so July 6 + 25 days is July 31. Then adding 52 days (since 77-25=52) would be 52 days into August. August has 31 days, so 31 days would take us to September 1. Then 52-31=21 days into September. So September 21 + 1 day is September 22? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that 80 days is 11 weeks and 3 days. So if July 6 is a Wednesday, then adding 3 days would be Saturday. Therefore, the answer should be Saturday. But I need to make sure that the date calculation is correct. Let me check the actual date. Wait, if I add 80 days to July 6, 2022, what is the date?\n\nJuly has 31 days. So July 6 + 25 days is July 31. Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days would be August 31 (25 + 31 = 56 days). Then September has 30 days, so adding 24 days (80 - 56 = 24) would be September 24. So September 24, 2022. Now, I need to check what day that is. Let me check the days of the week for that date. Since July 6 is a Wednesday, let's count the days step by step.\n\nJuly 6: Wednesday\n\nJuly 13: Wednesday (7 days later)\n\nJuly 20: Wednesday\n\nJuly 27: Wednesday\n\nAugust 3: Wednesday\n\nAugust 10: Wednesday\n\nAugust 17: Wednesday\n\nAugust 24: Wednesday\n\nAugust 31: Wednesday\n\nSeptember 7: Wednesday\n\nSeptember 14: Wednesday\n\nSeptember 21: Wednesday\n\nSeptember 28: Wednesday\n\nSo September 28 is a Wednesday. Then September 29 is Thursday, September 30 is Friday, October 1 is Saturday. Wait, but September 24 is 24 days after July 6. Let me count the days from July 6 to September 24. July has 31 days, so from July 6 to July 31 is 25 days. Then August has 31 days, so adding 31 days would be August 31 (25 + 31 = 56 days). Then September 24 is 24 days into September. So 56 + 24 = 80 days. So September 24 is the correct date. Now, from the previous list, September 28 is Wednesday. So September 24 is 4 days before that. So September 24 would be Wednesday minus 4 days. Wednesday minus 1 day is Tuesday, minus 2 is Monday, minus 3 is Sunday, minus 4 is Saturday. So September 24 is a Saturday. That matches the earlier calculation of adding 3 days to Wednesday.

I need to figure out which day of the month that is. \n\nFirst, I should check what day of the week May 1, 2022, was. Wait, I remember that May 1, 2022, was a Sunday. Let me confirm that. If that's correct, then May 1 is Sunday, May 2 is Monday, May 3 is Tuesday, May 4 is Wednesday, May 5 is Thursday. So the first Thursday of May 2022 is the 5th. Then the second Thursday would be the 12th. Wait, but let me count again to be sure.\n\nStarting from May 1 (Sunday):\n- May 1: Sunday\n- May 2: Monday\n- May 3: Tuesday\n- May 4: Wednesday\n- May 5: Thursday (1st Thursday)\n- May 6: Friday\n- May 7: Saturday\n- May 8: Sunday\n- May 9: Monday\n- May 10: Tuesday\n- May 11: Wednesday\n- May 12: Thursday (2nd Thursday)\n\nSo that would make the second Thursday on the 12th.
